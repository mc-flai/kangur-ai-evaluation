**Reasoning**: The Mathematical Kangaroo competition takes place on the third Thursday of March each year. To find the latest possible date, we need to determine the latest that the third Thursday can occur.

March 22nd is the absolute latest that the third Thursday of March can fall. If March starts on a Thursday, then the 7th would be the first Thursday, the 14th the second Thursday, and the 21st the third Thursday. However, if March starts on a Wednesday, then the 8th would be the first Thursday, the 15th the second Thursday, and the 22nd the third Thursday.

Therefore, March 22nd is the latest possible date for the third Thursday of March.
