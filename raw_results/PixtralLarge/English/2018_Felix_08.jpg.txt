To determine which piece is left over after Lisa uses exactly 3 pieces to complete her jigsaw, we need to examine the shapes of the pieces and how they fit into the jigsaw pattern shown.

The jigsaw pattern consists of:
- 2 corner pieces (one with a notch on the top left and a bump on the bottom right, and one with a notch on the bottom left and a bump on the top right)
- 2 edge pieces (one with a bump on the top and a notch on the bottom, and one with a notch on the top and a bump on the bottom)
- 1 center piece (with a bump on the left and a notch on the right)

Let's analyze the pieces:
- Piece A (cyan) is an edge piece with a notch on the top and a bump on the bottom.
- Piece B (pink) is a corner piece with a bump on the bottom right and a notch on the top left.
- Piece C (green) is a corner piece with a notch on the bottom left and a bump on the top right.
- Piece D (black) is a center piece with a bump on the left and a notch on the right.

Lisa needs:
1. One center piece (D)
2. One corner piece with a bump on the bottom right and a notch on the top left (B)
3. One corner piece with a notch on the bottom left and a bump on the top right (C)

Thus, the pieces required to complete the jigsaw are B, C, and D. This leaves Piece A (cyan) as the piece that is left over.

Reasoning: Lisa needs 3 specific pieces to complete her jigsaw: B (corner piece), C (corner piece), and D (center piece). This leaves Piece A (cyan, edge piece) as the one that is left over.
Answer: A
