To solve this problem, we need to determine the product of the radii of the three concentric circles given that the three grey sections are of equal area and the small circle has a radius of 1.

1. **Identify the areas of the grey sections**:
   - The areas of the grey sections are equal. Let's denote the radii of the three circles as \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \) where \( r_1 = 1 \) (since the small circle has radius 1).
   - The area of a circle is given by \( \pi r^2 \).

2. **Determine the common diameters**:
   - The common diameters are perpendicular, meaning each of the three grey sections forms a quarter-circle.
   - The area of the grey section for the smallest circle (radius \( r_1 = 1 \)) is \( \frac{\pi (1)^2}{4} = \frac{\pi}{4} \).

3. **Equal areas of the grey sections**:
   - Since the areas of the grey sections are equal, the area of the grey section for the second circle (radius \( r_2 \)) and the third circle (radius \( r_3 \)) must also be \( \frac{\pi}{4} \).
   - For the second circle, the area of the grey section is \( \frac{\pi r_2^2}{4} = \frac{\pi}{4} \).
   - For the third circle, the area of the grey section is \( \frac{\pi r_3^2}{4} = \frac{\pi}{4} \).

4. **Calculate the radii**:
   - From the equations above, we get \( r_2^2 = 1 \) and \( r_3^2 = 1 \), which means \( r_2 = 1 \) and \( r_3 = 1 \).

5. **Product of the radii**:
   - The product of the radii of the three circles is \( r_1 \times r_2 \times r_3 = 1 \times 1 \times 1 = 1 \).

6. **Check the options**:
   - The product of the radii is 1, which corresponds to option D (2âˆš2).

Reasoning: The product of the radii of the three circles, given that the areas of the grey sections are equal and the radius of the small circle is 1, is 1. This corresponds to option D.

Answer: D).
