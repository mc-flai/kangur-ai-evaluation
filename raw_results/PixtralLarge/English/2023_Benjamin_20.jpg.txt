To determine the correct answer for question 20, let's analyze the shapes in each field of the pyramid. The problem states that each field in the second and third row contains exactly the shapes of the two fields below it.

Let's break down the information given:

- The top row has three shapes: a circle, a square, and a triangle.
- In the second row, the left field contains a circle and a triangle. The right field contains a square.
- In the third row, the left field contains a circle. The right field contains a square and a triangle.

Now, we need to determine which shapes should go into the empty field in the bottom row. This empty field should contain the shapes from the two fields directly above it.

The two fields directly above the empty field are:
- The right field in the third row (square and triangle)
- The left field in the second row (circle and triangle)

Combining these shapes, we get a square, a circle, and a triangle.

Therefore, the correct choice is:

Reasoning: The empty field in the bottom row should contain the shapes from the two fields directly above it, which are a square, a circle, and a triangle.
Answer: D).
