The problem describes a die where each side is marked with either 1, 2, or 3 dots. The probabilities for rolling a 1, a 2, or a 3 are given as 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6 respectively.

To determine which of the given pictures cannot be a picture of this particular die, we need to consider the probabilities:

- The probability of rolling a 1 is 1/2, so there must be 3 faces with 1 dot.
- The probability of rolling a 2 is 1/3, so there must be 2 faces with 2 dots.
- The probability of rolling a 3 is 1/6, so there must be 1 face with 3 dots.

Now, let's examine each option:

- (A): Contains 2 dots, 2 dots, and 1 dot. This is consistent with one of the faces with 2 dots.
- (B): Contains 1 dot, 1 dot, and 2 dots. This is consistent with one of the faces with 1 dot.
- (C): Contains 3 dots, 3 dots, and 1 dot. This is inconsistent because there can only be one face with 3 dots.
- (D): Contains 1 dot, 2 dots, and 3 dots. This is consistent with one of the faces with 1 dot, 2 dots, and 3 dots.
- (E): Contains 2 dots, 2 dots, and 1 dot. This is consistent with one of the faces with 2 dots.

Option (C) shows 2 faces with 3 dots and 1 face with 1 dot, which contradicts the given probabilities.

Reasoning: Option (C) shows 2 faces with 3 dots and 1 face with 1 dot, contradicting the given probabilities of 1/6 for 3 dots and 1/2 for 1 dot.
Answer: C)
