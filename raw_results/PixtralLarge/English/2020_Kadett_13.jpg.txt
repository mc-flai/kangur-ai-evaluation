To determine which picture correctly represents what you will see if you look from above the piece represented on the right, we need to consider what the view from above (a top-down view) would look like.

The piece on the right is a 3D triangular pyramid with a triangular base. Let's break down the steps:

1. Identify the view from above: When viewing a triangular pyramid from directly above, you will see the triangular base prominently.
2. Analyze the options: 
   - Option (A) shows a view where the triangular base is partially covered by one of the sides.
   - Option (B) shows a view similar to (A) but with a different part of the side covering the base.
   - Option (C) shows a clear view of the triangular base.
   - Option (D) shows a view where one vertex of the triangle is obscured by a side.
   - Option (E) shows a view with the triangular base partially obscured by the sides.

From the analysis, option (C) best represents the view from directly above the pyramid, as it clearly shows the triangular base without any obstruction from the sides.

Reasoning: The view from directly above a triangular pyramid will show the triangular base clearly, without any sides obstructing the view. Option (C) matches this description.

Answer: C).
