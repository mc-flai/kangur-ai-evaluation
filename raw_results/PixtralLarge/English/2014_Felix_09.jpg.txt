**Reasoning**: The question asks what the other piece looks like when a rectangle is cut into two pieces, with one piece shown resembling a jagged shape. The other piece must be the complementary shape that fits perfectly with the shown piece to form a complete rectangle.

Analyzing the options:
- Option A and C have more jagged edges which would not complement the shape shown.
- Option E has fewer jagged edges and does not match the shape shown.
- Option D has the correct jagged edges but in reverse order which would not fit perfectly.
- Option B has the complementary jagged edges that would fit perfectly with the shown piece to form a rectangle.

**Answer**: B)
