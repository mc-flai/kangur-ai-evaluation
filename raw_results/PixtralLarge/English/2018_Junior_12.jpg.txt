**Reasoning**:
1. We need to determine how many numbers in the sequence 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, ... are divisible by 3.
2. To be divisible by 3, a number must be one of the multiples of 3, i.e., 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, ...
3. From the given sequence, we can observe the pattern that each number n appears exactly n times.
4. We need to count all multiples of 3 up to the last number present in the sequence.

First, let's determine the last number in the sequence:
- The total count of numbers is 105.
- The sum of the first k natural numbers is given by the formula: \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \).
- We need to find k such that \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} = 105 \).

Solving for k:
\[ \frac{k(k+1)}{2} = 105 \]
\[ k(k+1) = 210 \]
\[ k^2 + k - 210 = 0 \]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
\[ k = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 840}}{2} \]
\[ k = \frac{-1 \pm 29}{2} \]

Taking the positive root (since k must be positive):
\[ k = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Therefore, the last number in the sequence is 14, and the sequence contains all numbers from 1 to 14, written according to the given pattern.

Now, we count the multiples of 3 in the sequence:
- Multiples of 3 within the range 1 to 14 are: 3, 6, 9, 12.
- Each of these numbers appears exactly 3, 6, 9, and 12 times respectively in the sequence.

Summing these up:
\[ 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 = 30 \]

So, there are 30 numbers in the sequence that are divisible by 3.
