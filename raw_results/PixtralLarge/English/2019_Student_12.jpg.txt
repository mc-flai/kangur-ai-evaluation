**Reasoning**: 

1. Let's denote the number of boys last year as B and the number of girls last year as G.
2. This year, the number of boys is B * 1.20 (since it increased by 20%).
3. This year, the number of girls is G * 0.80 (since it decreased by 20%).
4. The total number of students last year was B + G.
5. The total number of students this year is (B * 1.20) + (G * 0.80).
6. According to the problem, there is now one person more than before in this class. Therefore, (B * 1.20) + (G * 0.80) = B + G + 1.
7. Simplifying the equation: 1.20B + 0.80G = B + G + 1 → 0.20B - 0.20G = 1 → 0.20(B - G) = 1 → B - G = 5.
8. This means the difference between the number of boys and girls last year was 5.
9. Checking the given options, we need to find a number where adding 5 results in the new total number of students.
    - A) 22: 22 - 5 = 17 (not possible as it implies negative students)
    - B) 26: 26 - 5 = 21 (not possible as it implies negative students)
    - C) 29: 29 - 5 = 24 (possible, since 24 + 5 = 29)
    - D) 31: 31 - 5 = 26 (not possible as it implies negative students)
    - E) 34: 34 - 5 = 29 (not possible as it implies negative students)
10. Only option (C) 29 fits the condition correctly.

**Answer**: C)
