**Reasoning**: To determine which balloon Mia definitely hit, we need to check the points required to reach a total of 30 points. If the sum exceeds 30 points without including a particular balloon, then that balloon must have been hit.

Let's check the sums excluding each balloon one by one:
- Excluding the 3-point balloon: The sum is 9 + 13 + 14 + 18 = 54 points.
- Excluding the 9-point balloon: The sum is 3 + 13 + 14 + 18 = 48 points.
- Excluding the 13-point balloon: The sum is 3 + 9 + 14 + 18 = 44 points.
- Excluding the 14-point balloon: The sum is 3 + 9 + 13 + 18 = 43 points.
- Excluding the 18-point balloon: The sum is 3 + 9 + 13 + 14 = 39 points.

In each case except when excluding the 18-point balloon, the sum exceeds 30 points. Therefore, Mia must have hit the 18-point balloon to achieve exactly 30 points.
