To determine the minimum number of bridges that need to be closed off to ensure there is no connection from island A to island B, we need to identify and eliminate all possible paths connecting A to B.

1. **Identify all paths from A to B**:
   - Trace all the routes from A to B and identify the key bridges in each path.

2. **Determine the critical bridges**:
   - These are bridges that, when closed, will disconnect all paths from A to B.
   - Look for bridges that are common in multiple paths or bridges that, if closed, would force the path through another bridge that can also be closed.

3. **Minimum number of bridges**:
   - Close the bridges one by one and ensure that after closing each bridge, the remaining network still has no path from A to B.
   - Repeat this process until all paths are disconnected.

In this specific diagram, upon analyzing the paths and critical bridges, we need to ensure that we close the optimal number of bridges to disconnect the network.

**Reasoning**:
- By closing the bridges that connect A to the intermediate islands and B to the intermediate islands, we can ensure that there is no possible path left from A to B.
- Closing 3 bridges is enough to achieve this, as closing any fewer would still leave at least one path connecting A to B.

**Answer**: C)
