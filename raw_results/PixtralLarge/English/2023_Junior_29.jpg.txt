**Reasoning:** 

1. Let's denote the initial number of points as \( n \).
2. Each time Renate marks a point between each pair of adjacent points, she is effectively doubling the number of points because for \( n \) points, there are \( n-1 \) gaps, and each gap gets a new point. Therefore, after the first iteration, the number of points becomes \( 2n - 1 \).
3. Renate repeats this process three more times. So, we need to apply the doubling process three more times starting from the number of points after the first iteration.

   We start with \( n \) points and after the first iteration, we get:
   \[
   2n - 1
   \]

4. After the second iteration, we apply the doubling process again:
   \[
   2(2n - 1) - 1 = 4n - 2 - 1 = 4n - 3
   \]

5. After the third iteration:
   \[
   2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 6 - 1 = 8n - 7
   \]

6. After the fourth iteration:
   \[
   2(8n - 7) - 1 = 16n - 14 - 1 = 16n - 15
   \]

7. We are given that after these four iterations (three more times after the first), the total number of points is 225. So we set up the equation:
   \[
   16n - 15 = 225
   \]

8. Solving for \( n \):
   \[
   16n - 15 = 225
   \]
   \[
   16n = 240
   \]
   \[
   n = 15
   \]

**Answer:** A).
