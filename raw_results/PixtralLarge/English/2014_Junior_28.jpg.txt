To solve question 28, we need to analyze the given information and the diagram provided.

1. **Given Information**:
   - PT is the tangent to the circle O at point T.
   - PB is the angle bisector of angle TPA.

2. **Properties of Tangents and Angle Bisectors**:
   - A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. Therefore, OT is perpendicular to PT.
   - Since PB is the angle bisector of angle TPA, it divides angle TPA into two equal parts.

3. **Determining the Angle TBP**:
   - Since OT is perpendicular to PT, angle OTP is 90 degrees.
   - Angle TPA is the external angle for triangle OTP, and it is equal to the sum of the opposite interior angles, which are angle OTP and angle OPT.
   - Since angle OTP is 90 degrees, angle OPT must be 90 degrees minus angle TPA divided by 2 (because PB is the angle bisector).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The angle TBP does not depend on the specific location of point P but rather on the properties of the tangent and the angle bisector.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is that it depends on the location of point P.

Reasoning: The angle TBP is influenced by the properties of the tangent and the angle bisector, which are not dependent on a fixed value but rather on the geometric relationships that depend on the location of point P.

Answer: E).
