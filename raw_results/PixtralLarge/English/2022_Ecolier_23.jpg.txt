To solve this problem, we need to determine how many small white cubes are needed to construct the big cube shown in the diagram.

Step 1: Analyze the structure of the big cube. The big cube is composed of three types of building blocks.
- The large L-shaped block.
- The rectangular block.
- The small white cube.

Step 2: Determine the dimensions of the big cube. From the diagram, it appears that the big cube is a 3x3x3 cube.

Step 3: Calculate the total volume of the big cube.
- Volume of the big cube = 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 small cubes.

Step 4: Identify the number of small white cubes.
- Since the big cube is made up of three different blocks, we need to determine how many small white cubes are included in these blocks.
- The large L-shaped block and rectangular block each occupy a distinct volume, but they do not overlap each other completely.
- By inspecting the diagram, we can see that the small white cube is the only block that appears in the full count of small cubes within the 3x3x3 cube.

Step 5: Count the small white cubes.
- The big cube is made up of 27 small unit cubes.
- The diagram shows that within the 3x3x3 structure, there are specific positions occupied by the white cubes.
- Upon careful counting, we can see that there are 13 small white cubes.

Reasoning: By analyzing the structure of the big cube and counting the number of small white cubes, we find that there are 13 small white cubes.
Answer: C).
