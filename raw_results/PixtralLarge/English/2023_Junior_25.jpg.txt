1. **Determine the effective battery life**:
   - Matilda boards the train with half of the full battery.
   - The full battery has a life of 32 hours for phoning, so the half-full battery will last 16 hours if she phones continuously.
   - The full battery has a life of 20 hours for surfing the internet, so the half-full battery will last 10 hours if she surfs continuously.
   - The full battery has a life of 80 hours if not used, so the half-full battery will last 40 hours if she does not use the phone.

2. **Calculate the average battery usage rate**:
   - Since Matilda spends the same amount of time on each activity (phoning, surfing, and not using the phone), we need to find the average battery life.
   - The average battery life = (16 hours + 10 hours + 40 hours) / 3 = 66 hours / 3 = 22 hours.

3. **Determine the duration of the train ride**:
   - The battery is empty when she arrives at her destination.
   - Since she uses the phone in different modes and the average battery life is 22 hours, the train ride took 22 hours.

**Reasoning**:
   - The train ride took 22 hours, which is closest to option (D).

**Answer**: D).
