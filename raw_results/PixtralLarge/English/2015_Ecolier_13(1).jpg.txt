To determine the number of different orders Joseph can put the toys on the shelf, we need to consider the constraints given:
- The ship must be next to the car.
- The teddy bear should also be next to the car.

This means the car, ship, and teddy bear must be placed adjacent to each other in some order. Let's analyze the possible arrangements:

1. Car, Ship, Teddy Bear, Ball
2. Car, Teddy Bear, Ship, Ball
3. Ship, Car, Teddy Bear, Ball
4. Teddy Bear, Car, Ship, Ball
5. Ball, Car, Ship, Teddy Bear
6. Ball, Ship, Car, Teddy Bear
7. Ball, Teddy Bear, Car, Ship
8. Ball, Car, Teddy Bear, Ship

We can see that there are indeed 8 different possible orders that satisfy the given constraints.

**Reasoning**: By listing out all possible arrangements that satisfy the constraints (the ship and the teddy bear must be next to the car), we can determine that there are 8 valid different orders.

**Answer**: E).
