To determine the day of the week when the conversation took place, we need to analyze the statements made by the bear and the panther.

1. The bear lies on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
2. The panther lies on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.
3. Both speak the truth on all other days.

Given that both the bear and the panther say "Yesterday was one of my lying days," we need to find a day when both animals would truthfully say that the previous day was a lying day for them.

Let's analyze each day:
- **Monday**: The bear lies on Monday, so it can't be Monday.
- **Tuesday**: The bear lies on Tuesday, so it can't be Tuesday.
- **Wednesday**: The bear lies on Wednesday, so it can't be Wednesday.
- **Thursday**: The panther lies on Thursday, so it can't be Thursday.
- **Friday**: The panther lies on Friday, so it can't be Friday.
- **Saturday**: The panther lies on Saturday, so it can't be Saturday.
- **Sunday**: The bear and the panther both tell the truth on Sunday. "Yesterday was one of my lying days" would be true for both because Saturday is a lying day for the panther.

Thus, the only day that fits is Sunday.

Reasoning: The only day when both the bear and the panther would truthfully say "Yesterday was one of my lying days" is Sunday, as Saturday is a lying day for the panther.
Answer: D).
