**Reasoning**: Franziska writes down three consecutive two-digit numbers using symbols instead of digits. The given sequence is □Φ, ♡Δ, ◇▢. Following the pattern of the symbols used, we need to identify the next number in the sequence.

1. The first symbol pair is □Φ.
2. The second symbol pair is ♡Δ.
3. The third symbol pair is ◇▢.

We observe that the symbols seem to have a pattern where each symbol is different in each pair. To determine the next number, we should continue the pattern by using symbols that have not been paired together in the previous numbers.

Looking at the options:
- (A) □♡
- (B) □▢
- (C) ◇♡
- (D) Φ▢
- (E) ♡◇

The option (C) ◇♡ uses symbols that have appeared but not paired together yet, which follows the pattern of using different combinations.

**Answer**: C).
