**Reasoning**: We need to find the sixth factor of the positive whole number \( N \) which has exactly six different positive factors. The product of five of these factors is given as 648. The factors of \( N \) include 1 and \( N \) itself.

Let's denote the six factors as \( f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4, f_5, f_6 \) where \( f_1 = 1 \) and \( f_6 = N \).

The product of five of these factors is 648, which means:
\[ f_1 \times f_2 \times f_3 \times f_4 \times f_5 = 648 \]

Since \( f_1 = 1 \), the above equation simplifies to:
\[ f_2 \times f_3 \times f_4 \times f_5 = 648 \]

\( f_6 \) is the sixth factor, which is \( N \), the number itself. We need to find which of the given numbers is \( N \).

We can check the given options to see which one, when multiplied by another factor, gives 648.

Let's try the options:
- If \( N = 4 \):
  \[ 1 \times 2 \times 4 \times \text{??} = 648 \]
  This is not possible since \( 1 \times 2 \times 4 = 8 \) and no other factors can make the product 648.

- If \( N = 8 \):
  \[ 1 \times 2 \times 4 \times 8 = 64 \]
  This is not possible since the product is 64, not 648.

- If \( N = 9 \):
  \[ 1 \times 3 \times 9 \times \text{??} = 648 \]
  This is not possible since \( 1 \times 3 \times 9 = 27 \).

- If \( N = 12 \):
  \[ 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 6 \times 12 = 648 \]
  This is possible because \( 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 6 = 144 \) and \( 12 \times 144 = 1728 \), but the product of five of these factors is 648. If we exclude 12, we get:
  \[ 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 6 = 144 \]
  Thus \( 12 \times 144 = 1728 \), which is incorrect.

- If \( N = 24 \):
  \[ 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 6 \times 24 = 648 \]
  This is possible because:
  \[ 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 6 = 144 \]
  And \( 24 \times 144 = 3456 \), but we need to check five factors product:
  \[ 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 6 = 144 \]
  Therefore, \( 24 \times 144 = 3456 \), which is not correct, but the five factors product 648 is correct.

Thus, the correct sixth factor of \( N \) is 24.
