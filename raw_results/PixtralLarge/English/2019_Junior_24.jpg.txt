To solve this problem, we need to determine the side length of the square and then calculate its area.

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - A square has two vertices lying on the semi-circle and the other two on its diameter.
   - The radius of the circle is 1 cm.

2. **Identify the Relationship**:
   - Since the vertices of the square lie on the diameter and the semi-circle, the side length of the square is equal to the radius of the circle.
   - Therefore, the side length of the square is 1 cm.

3. **Calculate the Area**:
   - The area of a square is given by the formula: Area = (side length)^2.
   - Substituting the side length: Area = (1 cm)^2 = 1 cm^2.

4. **Match with the Options**:
   - Given options are:
     (A) \(\frac{4}{5} \text{ cm}^2\)
     (B) \(\frac{\pi}{4} \text{ cm}^2\)
     (C) 1 \(\text{ cm}^2\)
     (D) \(\frac{4}{3} \text{ cm}^2\)
     (E) \(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \text{ cm}^2\)

   - The correct answer is option (C) 1 \(\text{ cm}^2\).

Reasoning: The side length of the square is 1 cm, the same as the radius of the circle, and the area of the square is calculated as \( \text{(side length)}^2 = 1 \text{ cm}^2 \).
Answer: C)
