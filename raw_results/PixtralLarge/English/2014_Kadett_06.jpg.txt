To determine the area of the shape in question 6, we need to consider the area of each piece that Wanda used to form the shape.

1. The area of each page of square paper is 4.
2. Wanda cuts each page into right-angled triangles and squares.
3. From the left-hand diagram, we see that each page of area 4 is cut into 2 right-angled triangles (each with an area of 2) and 1 square (with an area of 2).

Now, let's analyze the right-hand diagram:
- The shape is composed of 2 right-angled triangles and 2 squares.
- The total area of the 2 right-angled triangles = 2 * 2 = 4.
- The total area of the 2 squares = 2 * 2 = 4.

Adding these areas together, the total area of the shape is:
4 (from the triangles) + 4 (from the squares) = 8.

However, the triangles and squares in the diagrams appear to be half of the square pieces. Therefore, each triangle is half of a square, so each triangle is actually 1 unit area (half of 2).

So the actual total area of the 2 triangles = 2 * 1 = 2.

Therefore, the correct total area is:
2 (from the triangles) + 4 (from the squares) = 6.

Reasoning: The shape is composed of 2 right-angled triangles (each with an area of 1) and 2 squares (each with an area of 2), totaling 6.
Answer: E).
