**Reasoning**: The problem states that 14.5 congruent rectangles are positioned in a square with a side length of 24 cm. To find the area of one of these rectangles, we first need to determine the total area occupied by the 14.5 rectangles and then divide that by 14.5.

The area of the square is:
\[ \text{Area of the square} = 24^2 = 576 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Since 14.5 congruent rectangles fill up this square, the total area occupied by these rectangles is also 576 cm².

The area of one rectangle is:
\[ \text{Area of one rectangle} = \frac{576 \, \text{cm}^2}{14.5} \]

Performing the division:
\[ \text{Area of one rectangle} = \frac{576}{14.5} \approx 39.655 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

The closest answer choice to this value is 32 cm².

**Answer**: E)
