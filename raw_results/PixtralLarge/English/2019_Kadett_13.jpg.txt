**Reasoning**: The question asks which 4x4 square cannot be made up of the two pieces shown. The two pieces on the right seem to be an L-shaped piece and its inverse. The L-shaped piece occupies three squares in a right angle, while its inverse can occupy a similar arrangement.

To solve this, we need to check each option to see if it's possible to combine the two pieces to form the given pattern. We can do this by mentally or physically rotating and placing the pieces on the 4x4 grid to see if they fit.

- **Option A**: This pattern can be made by placing the L-shaped piece in the top left corner and its inverse in the bottom right corner.
- **Option B**: This pattern can be created by placing the inverse L-shaped piece in the top left corner and the L-shaped piece in the bottom right corner.
- **Option C**: This pattern can be formed by placing the L-shaped piece in the bottom left corner and its inverse in the top right corner.
- **Option D**: This pattern can be made by placing the inverse L-shaped piece in the bottom left corner and the L-shaped piece in the top right corner.
- **Option E**: This pattern cannot be made with the two pieces because the arrangement does not allow the pieces to fit together without overlapping or leaving a gap.

**Answer**: E).
