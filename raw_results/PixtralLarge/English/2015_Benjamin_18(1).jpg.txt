**Reasoning**: To solve this, we need to ensure that Sebastian picks out enough fruits to guarantee that he has at least one apple and one pear of the same color.

1. Let's consider the worst-case scenario where he picks fruits without getting one apple and one pear of the same color:
   - He could pick all 3 green apples and all 7 green pears. That's 10 pieces of fruit, and he still doesn't have an apple and a pear of the same color.
   - Next, he could pick all 5 yellow apples. Now he has picked 15 pieces of fruit, and he still doesn't have an apple and a pear of the same color.
   - If he picks one more fruit, regardless of what it is, he will either get a yellow pear (which matches one of the yellow apples) or a green pear (matching one of the green apples).

So, the minimum number of fruits he needs to pick to ensure he has at least one apple and one pear of the same color is 16 - 10 = 6 pieces.

However, we must ensure we are considering picking conditions correctly. If he picks 11 fruits, he will have at least one apple and one pear of the same color.
