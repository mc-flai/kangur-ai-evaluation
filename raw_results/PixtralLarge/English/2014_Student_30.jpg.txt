**Reasoning**:
- Initially, there are 17 goats, 55 wolves, and 6 lions on the island.
- To reach a point where no more eating is possible, each type of animal must be transformed into another until it reaches stability.
- Each wolf that eats a goat will turn into a lion.
- Each lion that eats a goat will turn into a wolf.
- Each lion that eats a wolf will turn into a goat.

To find the maximum number of animals that can still be on the island, we need to consider the transformations:
1. Start with 17 goats, 55 wolves, and 6 lions.
2. Since a wolf eating a goat turns into a lion and a lion eating a goat turns into a wolf, the total number of goats consumed will reduce the number of goats.
3. Lions eating wolves will turn into goats, but this cycle will continue until no more transformations can occur.

If we consider the maximum transformations:
- The number of goats will be reduced by the number of wolves and lions eating them.
- Since the number of wolves and lions is larger than the number of goats initially, the maximum number of animals left would be the number of transformations that can occur.

Given the initial numbers:
- 55 wolves + 6 lions = 61 animals that can potentially transform into goats.
- However, since each transformation cycle involves a reduction in the number of animals, the maximum number of animals that can remain stable without further transformations is 23 (17 initial goats + 6 lions).
