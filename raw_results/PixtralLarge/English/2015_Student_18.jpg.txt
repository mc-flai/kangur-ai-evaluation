To determine the probability that Tina wins, we need to find the probability that Tina rolls a number higher than Bibi. We start by analyzing the possible outcomes for both Bibi and Tina.

1. Bibi's die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
2. Tina's die has the numbers 2, 2, 5, 5, 5.

We need to consider each possible roll by Bibi and find the corresponding probabilities of Tina rolling a higher number.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **If Bibi rolls a 1**: Tina will win with any of her rolls (2, 2, 5, 5, 5). Probability of Bibi rolling a 1 is 1/6.

- **If Bibi rolls a 2**: Tina will win with her rolls of 5 (3 out of 5 outcomes). Probability of Bibi rolling a 2 is 1/6.

- **If Bibi rolls a 3**: Tina will win with her rolls of 5 (3 out of 5 outcomes). Probability of Bibi rolling a 3 is 1/6.

- **If Bibi rolls a 4**: Tina will win with her rolls of 5 (3 out of 5 outcomes). Probability of Bibi rolling a 4 is 1/6.

- **If Bibi rolls a 5**: Tina cannot win (0 out of 5 outcomes). Probability of Bibi rolling a 5 is 1/6.

- **If Bibi rolls a 6**: Tina cannot win (0 out of 5 outcomes). Probability of Bibi rolling a 6 is 1/6.

### Calculating the Probabilities:

- When Bibi rolls a 1, the probability that Tina wins is 1 (5/5).
- When Bibi rolls a 2, the probability that Tina wins is 3/5.
- When Bibi rolls a 3, the probability that Tina wins is 3/5.
- When Bibi rolls a 4, the probability that Tina wins is 3/5.
- When Bibi rolls a 5, the probability that Tina wins is 0.
- When Bibi rolls a 6, the probability that Tina wins is 0.

### Total Probability Calculation:

The total probability that Tina wins is the sum of the individual probabilities, each weighted by the probability of Bibi's roll:

\[ P(\text{Tina wins}) = \left(\frac{1}{6} \times 1\right) + \left(\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{3}{5}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{3}{5}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{3}{5}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{6} \times 0\right) + \left(\frac{1}{6} \times 0\right) \]

\[ P(\text{Tina wins}) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{3}{30} + \frac{3}{30} + \frac{3}{30} \]

\[ P(\text{Tina wins}) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{10} \]

\[ P(\text{Tina wins}) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{3}{10} \]

\[ P(\text{Tina wins}) = \frac{5}{30} + \frac{9}{30} \]

\[ P(\text{Tina wins}) = \frac{14}{30} \]

\[ P(\text{Tina wins}) = \frac{7}{15} \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

Reasoning: Tina wins if she rolls a number higher than Bibi. Summing the probabilities of each possible scenario where Tina wins gives the total probability of Tina winning.

Answer: E) $\frac{11}{18}$.
