**Reasoning**:
1. Maria says it was Peter.
2. Peter says it was Richard.
3. Richard says it wasn't him, which implies it was someone else.
4. Tina says it wasn't her.

By analyzing the statements:
- Maria accused Peter.
- Peter deflected the blame to Richard.
- Richard denied it, which means it could be anyone but him.
- Tina denied it, meaning it could be anyone but her.

Since Maria, Peter, and Tina all denied it or shifted blame, the only person who could have told the truth is Richard, as he denied it but did not blame anyone else. Therefore, Richard is the one who spoke the truth, implying he did not break the window pane.

**Answer**: D).
