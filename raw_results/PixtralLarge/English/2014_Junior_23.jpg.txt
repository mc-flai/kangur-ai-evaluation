To determine the minimum number of lines Karl must draw so that each of the seven marked points is joined to the same number of other marked points, we need to consider the following:

1. There are 7 marked points.
2. Each point must be connected to the same number of other points.
3. If each point is connected to exactly 2 other points, the total number of connections is:
    - Total connections = 7 points * 2 connections per point / 2 (since each connection involves two points) = 7 lines.
4. Since we need to minimize the number of lines, we will consider the smallest number that can equally distribute the connections among all points.

By calculating, if we connect each point to exactly 2 other points, we need a total of 7 lines. However, since each connection between two points counts as one line, we need to halve the total to avoid double counting:

- Total minimum lines needed = 7 / 2 = 3.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a line, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4 lines.

Reasoning: Each of the 7 points needs to be connected to 2 other points, which initially suggests 7 connections. However, considering that each line is counted twice (once for each endpoint), the minimum number of lines needed is 4.
