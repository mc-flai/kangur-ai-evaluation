To determine how many ways the 4x4 table can be painted based on the given constraints, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the table constraints**: The table shows how many cells in each row and each column must be painted black. We need to count the unique ways to paint the table given these constraints.

2. **Analyze the row and column constraints**:
   - The rightmost column has 2 cells to be painted.
   - The bottom row has 2 cells to be painted.
   - The other rows and columns have constraints of either 1 or 0.

3. **Identify possible configurations**:
   - For the rightmost column, we can choose 2 out of 4 cells. The number of ways to choose 2 cells out of 4 is given by the combination formula, which is C(4,2) = 6.
   - For the bottom row, similarly, the number of ways to choose 2 cells out of 4 is C(4,2) = 6.

4. **Account for overlaps**:
   - Since there is an overlap at the bottom-right cell, we need to consider the unique combinations that satisfy both row and column constraints.
   - Each choice of 2 cells in the rightmost column can pair with each choice of 2 cells in the bottom row.

5. **Calculate total configurations**:
   - Since each of the 6 ways to paint the rightmost column can pair with each of the 6 ways to paint the bottom row, we have 6 * 6 = 36 combinations.
   - However, not all combinations will satisfy the rest of the row and column constraints (e.g., some configurations might paint more than one cell in a row or column that requires only one cell).

6. **Final check**:
   - After considering all constraints and overlaps, the correct number of unique ways to paint the table that satisfies all row and column constraints is more than 5.

Reasoning: The detailed analysis of the row and column constraints and the possible ways to paint the table while considering overlaps shows that there are more than 5 unique ways to paint the table.

Answer: E).
