To determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the set \(\{10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90\}\) so that the product of the remaining elements is a square number, we need to understand the properties of square numbers:

A number is a square if its prime factorization has even powers for all primes.

Let's factorize the numbers in the set:
- \(10 = 2 \times 5\)
- \(20 = 2^2 \times 5\)
- \(30 = 2 \times 3 \times 5\)
- \(40 = 2^3 \times 5\)
- \(50 = 2 \times 5^2\)
- \(60 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5\)
- \(70 = 2 \times 5 \times 7\)
- \(80 = 2^4 \times 5\)
- \(90 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5\)

Combining all these, the prime factorization of the product of all elements of the set is:
\[10 \times 20 \times 30 \times 40 \times 50 \times 60 \times 70 \times 80 \times 90 = 2^{14} \times 3^4 \times 5^8 \times 7\]

To make this a square number, the powers of all primes should be even. Here, the prime 7 has an odd power.

To make the power of 7 even, we must remove at least one element that contains the factor 7. The only number containing 7 is 70.

So, removing 70 will make the product a square number.

Reasoning: Removing the element 70, which contains the factor 7, will make the power of 7 even in the product of the remaining elements, thus making the product a square number.
