**Reasoning**:
1. There are nine balloons and three darts.
2. Each dart will continue in the same direction even after bursting a balloon.
3. This implies that a dart may hit multiple balloons lined up in its path.
4. The balloons that won't be hit are those which are not in the path of any of the darts.
5. From the diagram, we observe that two darts hit three balloons each, and one dart does not hit any balloons.
6. Therefore, the total number of balloons hit by darts is six.
7. Consequently, the number of balloons not hit by any dart is 9 - 6 = 3.

**Answer**: B)
