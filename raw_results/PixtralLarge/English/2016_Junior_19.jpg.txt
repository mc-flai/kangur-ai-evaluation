**Reasoning**: The diagram contains a cube, which has 8 vertices. Each of the 4 angles marked in the diagram must be the interior angles of the triangles formed by the vertices of the cube. Since each triangle in a cube is an equilateral triangle, each interior angle of these triangles is 60 degrees. Therefore, the sum of these four angles is 4 * 60° = 240°.

None of the provided options is 240°. However, if we consider the sum of angles around a vertex in the cube, each vertex has 3 angles that sum up to 270° (since each angle is 90°). Therefore, the total sum of angles around 4 vertices would be 4 * 270° = 1080°. But since the question asks for the sum of the marked angles, which are the interior angles of the triangles formed, we should reconsider that the correct answer corresponds to the sum of the angles around one vertex, which is 360°.

**Answer**: D)
