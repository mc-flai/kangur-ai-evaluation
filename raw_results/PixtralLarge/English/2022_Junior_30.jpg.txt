To determine the diameter of the holes, we need to consider the geometry of the wooden cube and the hemispheric holes.

1. Each face of the cube has a side length of 2 units.
2. The holes are hemispheres, and each hole touches each adjacent hemisphere at exactly one point.
3. The center of each hemisphere will be at the midpoint of the cube's face, which is at (1,1) if we consider the face of the cube as a 2x2 square.
4. The radius of the hemisphere will extend to the midpoint of the adjacent face.
5. The distance from the midpoint of one face to the midpoint of an adjacent face (which is the diameter of the hole) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.

Let's calculate the distance between the midpoints of two adjacent faces:
- The distance between the centers of two adjacent faces is the diagonal of a square with side length 2.
- The diagonal of a square with side length \(a\) is given by \(a\sqrt{2}\).
- Therefore, the diagonal of a square with side length 2 is \(2\sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the diameter of the holes is \(2\sqrt{2}\).

Reasoning: The diameter of the holes is calculated based on the distance between the midpoints of two adjacent faces of the cube, which is the diagonal of a square with side length 2.

Answer: C).
