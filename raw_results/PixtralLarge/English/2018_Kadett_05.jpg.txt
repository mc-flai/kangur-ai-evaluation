**Reasoning**:
1. When a fence with holes falls over, the holes would still be visible in the same pattern as they were when the fence was upright.
2. The holes in the fence would not change shape or position relative to each other just because the fence has fallen over.

4. Analyzing the options, we see that only option E shows the fence with the holes in the same pattern as they were in the upright position.

**Answer**: E)
