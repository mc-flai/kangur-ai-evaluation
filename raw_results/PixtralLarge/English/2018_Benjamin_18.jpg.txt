The problem states that Hannes uses the letters A, B, C, and D in a calculation, where different letters stand for different digits. We need to determine which digit the letter B stands for. The calculation given is:

      A
    + C B
    -----
      B D D

To solve this, we analyze the structure of the addition:

1. **Units Column**:
   - D + B = D (with a possible carry from the tens place).
   - This implies that B must be 0 because the only way for a digit added to another digit to yield the same digit is if one of them is zero.

2. **Tens Column**:
   - C + A (plus a possible carry from the units column, which is 1 if D + B > 9).
   - Since B is zero, there is no carry from the units column.
   - Therefore, C + A must equal B (which is 0) with a carry of 1 to the hundreds place.

Given these observations, B must be 0.

Reasoning: B must be 0 because the only way for a digit added to another digit to yield the same digit is if one of them is zero.
Answer: A).
