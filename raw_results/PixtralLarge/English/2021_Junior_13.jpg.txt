To solve question 13, we need to determine the number placed in the circle with the question mark. The given information states that the sums of the numbers on each of the three rings are the same. The numbers from 1 to 6 are placed at the intersections of the rings, and the number 6 is already shown in one of the intersections.

Let's denote the sums of the numbers on the rings as follows:
- Ring 1: Sum of numbers (including intersections)
- Ring 2: Sum of numbers (including intersections)
- Ring 3: Sum of numbers (including intersections)

Since the sums of the numbers on each ring are the same, we can set up an equation to find the missing number (denoted as x), which is placed in the circle with the question mark.

The numbers on the rings can be arranged as follows:
- Ring 1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, x
- Ring 2: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, x
- Ring 3: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, x

The sum of the numbers on each ring must be the same. Therefore, we can write the following equations:

Sum of Ring 1 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + x
Sum of Ring 2 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + x
Sum of Ring 3 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + x

Since the sums are equal, we have:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + x = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + x = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + x

Simplifying the equations, we get:

15 + x = 16 + x = 17 + x

Since the sums are equal, we can equate the constant terms:

15 + x = 16 + x
15 + x = 17 + x

This implies that x must be 1, as it is the only number that satisfies the equation.

Reasoning: The sums of the numbers on each ring are the same, and by setting up the equations and equating the constant terms, we find that the missing number x must be 1.
