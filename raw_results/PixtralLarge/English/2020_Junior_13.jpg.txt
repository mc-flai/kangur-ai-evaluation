To determine the distance from Betown to Atown, let's break down the information provided by the signposts:

1. From Cetown to Betown, the signpost on the left indicates it is 2 km.
2. From Betown to Atown, the signpost on the right indicates it is 4 km.

Therefore, the total distance from Betown to Atown is the sum of these two distances:
2 km (from Cetown to Betown) + 4 km (from Betown to Atown) = 6 km.

**Reasoning**:
- The signposts show distances from Cetown to Betown (2 km) and from Betown to Atown (4 km).
