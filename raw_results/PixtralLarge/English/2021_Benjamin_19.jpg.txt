**Reasoning**:
- There are 20 apples and 20 pears in the box, making a total of 40 pieces of fruit.
- Carl took 20 pieces of fruit randomly.
- Luca took the remaining 20 pieces.

We need to determine which statement is always true, considering the randomness of Carl's selection.

- **Option A**: "Carl got at least one pear."
  - This is not guaranteed since Carl could, in theory, take all 20 apples, although it is highly unlikely.

- **Option B**: "Carl got as many apples as pears."
  - This is not guaranteed. Carl could, for example, take 10 apples and 10 pears, or any other combination.

- **Option C**: "Carl got as many pears as Luca."
  - This is not necessarily true. There is no guarantee that Carl and Luca will have the same number of pears.

- **Option D**: "Carl got as many pears as Luca got apples."
  - This is also not necessarily true. There is no guarantee that Carl's number of pears will equal Luca's number of apples.

- **Option E**: "Carl got as many apples as Luca."
  - This is always true. Since Carl took 20 pieces out of 40, Luca takes the other 20. If Carl took x apples, Luca takes 20 - x apples. Thus, Carl and Luca must have the same number of apples.

**Answer**: E).
