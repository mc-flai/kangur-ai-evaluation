To determine which triple is not obtained from the sequence of integers from 1 to 99, divided into triples (groups of three), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the sequence**: The integers are listed in descending order without a gap, starting from 99 down to 1. The sequence is then divided into groups of three.

2. **Check the given triples**: We need to verify whether each given triple from the options matches any group of three numbers in the sequence.

3. **Identify the missing triple**: The triple that does not appear in the sequence will be the correct answer.

Let's check the triples:

- (123): Present in the sequence as part of (123)(456)(789)...
- (456): Present in the sequence as part of (123)(456)(789)...
- (789): Present in the sequence as part of (123)(456)(789)...
- (101): Present in the sequence as part of ...(101)(112)...
- (112): Present in the sequence as part of ...(101)(112)...
- (979): Present in the sequence as part of ...(979)(899)
- (899): Present in the sequence as part of ...(979)(899)

Now, let's check the given options and their presence in the sequence:

- (A) (222): Not present in the sequence because it violates the descending order rule.
- (B) (444): Not present in the sequence because it violates the descending order rule.
- (C) (464): Not present in the sequence because it violates the descending order rule.
- (D) (646): Not present in the sequence because it violates the descending order rule.
- (E) (888): Not present in the sequence because it violates the descending order rule.

Since none of these triples appear in the sequence, let's verify the options again:
- (222) is not present.
- (444) is not present.
- (464) is not present.
- (646) is not present.
- (888) is not present.

All the options are not present in the sequence, but we need to identify the one that specifically violates the descending order rule the most. (888) is the one that stands out because it is a repeated number.

Reasoning: The triple (888) is not obtained from the sequence because it violates the descending order rule and is not part of the sequence.

Answer: E).
