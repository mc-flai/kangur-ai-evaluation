**Reasoning**: The problem involves heights of a triangle, which are essentially altitudes that drop perpendicularly from a vertex to the opposite side. The length of a height must be greater than 0 cm but less than or equal to the length of the side it is perpendicular to. Given the lengths of two heights are 10 cm and 11 cm, the length of the third height must be less than or equal to these lengths to be a valid height. Therefore, any length greater than 11 cm cannot be a valid height for this triangle. This eliminates option E (100 cm).

Additionally, since heights are perpendicular distances, any length that is significantly less than the other two heights might not be reasonable in the context of a standard triangle. However, the problem does not provide enough information to further narrow down the exact lengths that are unreasonable other than using the greater than 11 cm criteria. Therefore, among the options provided, only E (100 cm) can be confidently ruled out.

**Answer**: E).
