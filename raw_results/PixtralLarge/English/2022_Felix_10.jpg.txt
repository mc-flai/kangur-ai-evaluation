To determine the number Carl hid, we need to match each shape with the digits in the given five-digit numbers. The shapes, from left to right, are: heart, spade, diamond, club, and spade.

1. **Heart** is the first shape, so it corresponds to the first digit.
2. **Spade** is the second shape, so it corresponds to the second digit.
3. **Diamond** is the third shape, so it corresponds to the third digit.
4. **Club** is the fourth shape, so it corresponds to the fourth digit.
5. **Spade** is the fifth shape, so it corresponds to the fifth digit.

From the given options:
- (A) 34426: Does not match the pattern (heart, spade, diamond, club, spade).
- (B) 34526: Does not match the pattern (heart, spade, diamond, club, spade).
- (C) 34423: Does not match the pattern (heart, spade, diamond, club, spade).
- (D) 34424: Matches the pattern (heart, spade, diamond, club, spade).
- (E) 32446: Does not match the pattern (heart, spade, diamond, club, spade).
