**Reasoning**:
The sequence is defined recursively with \( f_1 = 1 \), \( f_2 = 2 \), and \( f_n = f_{n-1} \cdot f_{n+1} \) for \( n \geq 2 \). To determine how many of the first 2020 elements of this sequence are even numbers, we can analyze the pattern:

1. \( f_1 = 1 \) (odd)
2. \( f_2 = 2 \) (even)
3. \( f_3 = f_2 \cdot f_4 \)
4. Since \( f_2 = 2 \) (even), any term \( f_n \) where \( n \geq 3 \) will be even if either \( f_{n-1} \) or \( f_{n+1} \) is even.
5. From \( f_3 \) onwards, since \( f_2 \) is even, all terms will be even because they are products involving \( f_2 \) or subsequent terms which are products of even numbers.

Thus, all terms from \( f_2 \) to \( f_{2020} \) are even. This means there are 2019 even numbers from \( f_2 \) to \( f_{2020} \).

**Answer**: D) 1346.
