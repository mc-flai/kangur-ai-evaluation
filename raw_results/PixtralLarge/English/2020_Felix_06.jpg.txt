To determine which cards Ana did not use, we need to compare the cards she had with the cards used in the tower.

On the left, Ana has the following cards:
- 2 red triangles pointing up
- 1 red triangle pointing down
- 1 red triangle pointing right
- 1 red triangle pointing left
- 4 blue circles
- 5 green squares

On the right, the tower is composed of:
- 1 red triangle pointing up
- 2 red triangles pointing down
- 1 red triangle pointing right
- 3 blue circles
- 3 green squares

By comparing the two sets, we can see that Ana did not use:
- 1 red triangle pointing up
- 1 blue circle
- 2 green squares

Therefore, the cards Ana did not use are:
- 1 red triangle pointing up
- 1 blue circle
- 1 green square

Reasoning: The tower on the right is missing 1 red triangle pointing up, 1 blue circle, and 1 green square from the set of cards Ana has.
