To solve this problem, let's consider the possible paths Maia the bee can take from point A to point B by coloring exactly three white houses with the same color.

First, observe the structure of the hexagonal grid and note that Maia can only walk on colorful houses. This means that we need to ensure that the path from A to B goes through exactly three white houses that we will color.

1. Start from house A and identify possible paths that involve exactly three white houses.
2. Each path should include exactly three white houses, which we must color to allow Maia to walk through.

Let's consider the paths:
- If Maia moves to the right, she will encounter a white house at each step.
- We need to ensure that exactly three of these white houses are colored, such that Maia can walk from A to B.

By analyzing the grid and possible routes, we can see that there are several different combinations of paths that will satisfy the condition.

For example:
- Color the first, second, and third white houses on a direct path from A to B.
- Color the first, third, and fourth white houses on an alternate path.
- Color the second, third, and fourth white houses on another alternate path.

After considering various combinations and ensuring that each path includes exactly three white houses, we can conclude that there are 20 unique ways to color exactly three white houses so that Maia can walk from A to B.

**Reasoning**: By analyzing the paths and ensuring exactly three white houses are colored in each path, we find that there are 20 such combinations.

**Answer**: E)
