**Reasoning**:
1. When a puppy unrolls a toilet paper roll while walking away at a constant speed, the thickness of the roll decreases as more paper is unrolled.
2. Initially, the thickness (y) is at its maximum, and it reduces as the unrolled part (x) increases.
3. The relationship between the thickness (y) and the unrolled part (x) is inversely proportional because as x increases, y decreases.
4. Among the provided graphs, the one that shows a decreasing trend (inverse relationship) is option D.

**Answer**: D)
