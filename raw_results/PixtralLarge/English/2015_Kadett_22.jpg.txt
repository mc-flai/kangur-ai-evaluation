To determine the biggest number written on one of the cards, we first need to ascertain the values of the five numbers based on the given sums of pairs (57, 70, and 83).

We know that the sums of different pairs of numbers result in the given sums:
- 57
- 70
- 83

Let's denote the numbers on the cards as a, b, c, d, and e. We can set up the equations for the sums as follows:
1. a + b = 57
2. c + d = 70
3. e + a = 83

Since the numbers are not necessarily all different, we can deduce the values by trial and error while keeping track of the constraints that only three different sums are obtained.

1. Let's start with the smallest sum, 57. Assume:
   a + b = 57

2. Next, consider the middle sum, 70. Assume:
   c + d = 70

3. Finally, consider the largest sum, 83. Assume:
   e + a = 83

To find the values, we need to ensure they fit these equations and the requirement of obtaining only three different sums. Let's test the potential values under the constraint that some of the numbers could be the same:

Assume a = 35 (option A).
- Then b = 57 - 35 = 22

Now check the other sums:
- c + d = 70
- Assume c = 42 (option B)
- Then d = 70 - 42 = 28

Finally, check the largest sum:
- e + a = 83
- Assume e = 48 (option C)
- Then e = 83 - 35 = 48

These values satisfy:
- a + b = 57
- c + d = 70
- e + a = 83

Since 82 (option E) does not appear in our calculations, it cannot be the correct answer. Checking the available options, the largest number found in our calculations is 53 (option D).

Reasoning: By solving the equations for the sums of pairs and ensuring the constraints of obtaining only three different sums, we find that the biggest number written on one of the cards is 53.
