To analyze question 10, let's break it down step-by-step by using the given information:

1. Byron is 5 cm taller than Aaron.
2. Byron is 10 cm shorter than Caron.
3. Darren is 10 cm taller than Caron.
4. Darren is 5 cm shorter than Erin.

From points 1 and 2, we can write:
- Byron = Aaron + 5 cm
- Byron = Caron - 10 cm

From points 3 and 4, we can write:
- Darren = Caron + 10 cm
- Darren = Erin - 5 cm

Now, let's analyze each statement:

(A) Aaron and Erin are equal heights.
- We need to compare Aaron and Erin.
- From the equations: Byron = Aaron + 5, Byron = Caron - 10, Darren = Caron + 10, Darren = Erin - 5
- Byron = Caron - 10 and Byron = Aaron + 5
- Caron - 10 = Aaron + 5
- Caron = Aaron + 15
- Darren = Erin - 5 and Darren = Caron + 10
- Erin - 5 = Caron + 10
- Erin = Caron + 15
- Aaron + 15 = Caron and Erin = Caron + 15
- Hence, Aaron and Erin are equal heights.

(B) Aaron is 10 cm taller than Erin.
- This statement is false because Aaron and Erin are equal heights.

(C) Aaron is 10 cm shorter than Erin.
- This statement is false because Aaron and Erin are equal heights.

(D) Aaron is 30 cm taller than Erin.
- This statement is false because Aaron and Erin are equal heights.

(E) Aaron is 30 cm shorter than Erin.
- This statement is false because Aaron and Erin are equal heights.

Reasoning: Based on the given information and analysis, we can conclude that Aaron and Erin are equal heights.

Answer: A)
