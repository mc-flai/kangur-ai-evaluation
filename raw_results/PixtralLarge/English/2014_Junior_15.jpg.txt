To determine the length of the crocodile, let's break down the problem step-by-step.

1. Let the total length of the crocodile be \( L \).
2. The length of the tail is one third of the total length, so the tail length is \( \frac{L}{3} \).
3. The length of the crocodile without its tail is \( L - \frac{L}{3} = \frac{2L}{3} \).
4. The head, which makes up one quarter of the length of the crocodile without its tail, is given as 93 cm. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{2L}{3} = 93 \).
5. Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{2L}{3} = 93 
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2L}{12} = 93 
   \]
   \[
   \frac{L}{6} = 93 
   \]
   \[
   L = 93 \times 6 
   \]
   \[
   L = 558 
   \]

Thus, the total length of the crocodile is 558 cm.

Reasoning: By using the given information about the tail and the head, we derived the total length of the crocodile through step-by-step calculations.
Answer: A).
