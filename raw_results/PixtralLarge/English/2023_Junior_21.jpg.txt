To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place the remaining numbers in the 9 squares according to the given rules:

1. There should be one number in each square.
2. The sum of three adjacent numbers is always a multiple of 3.
3. The numbers 3 and 1 are already placed.

The given diagram is as follows, where two numbers (3 and 1) are placed:

```
[ ] [ ] [ ] [3] [ ] [1] [ ] [ ] [ ]
```

We need to place the remaining numbers from 1 to 9 (except 3 and 1) in the remaining 7 squares such that the sum of any three adjacent numbers is a multiple of 3.

Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Placing adjacent to 3**:
   The sum of three adjacent numbers including 3 must be a multiple of 3. If we place x next to 3, then (3 + x + y) must be a multiple of 3.

2. **Placing adjacent to 1**:
   Similarly, if we place y next to 1, then (1 + y + z) must be a multiple of 3.

3. **Finding possible values**:
   We need to find combinations of numbers from 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 that satisfy these conditions.

4. **Counting the possibilities**:
   We need to count the number of valid combinations that satisfy the given rules.

After analyzing the possible placements and ensuring the sum conditions are met, we find that there are specific combinations that work.

Reasoning: By carefully placing the numbers and ensuring the sum of three adjacent numbers is a multiple of 3, we can determine the number of valid combinations.
