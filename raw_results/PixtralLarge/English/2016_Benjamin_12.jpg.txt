**Reasoning**:
1. Identify the nearest nut for each squirrel.
   - Squirrel A: Nearest nut is the first one to the right.
   - Squirrel B: Nearest nut is the first one to the left.
   - Squirrel C: Nearest nut is the first one to the right.
   - Squirrel D: Nearest nut is the first one to the left.
   - Squirrel E: Nearest nut is the first one to the right.

2. Calculate the time for each squirrel to get to their first nut. Since they start at the same time with the same speed, this can be inferred by the distance to the nearest nut.

3. Determine the second nut each squirrel will go for, based on their positions after collecting the first nut.
   - Squirrel A: After collecting the first nut to the right, A will go for the next available nut to the right.
   - Squirrel B: After collecting the first nut to the left, B will go for the next available nut to the left.
   - Squirrel C: After collecting the first nut to the right, C will go for the next available nut to the right.
   - Squirrel D: After collecting the first nut to the left, D will go for the next available nut to the left.
   - Squirrel E: After collecting the first nut to the right, E will go for the next available nut to the right.

4. Determine the order of collection:
   - Squirrel A will get the second nut first as it has the shortest distance to the second nut after collecting the first.

**Answer**: A) A
