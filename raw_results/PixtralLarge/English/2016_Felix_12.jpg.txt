To analyze question 12, we need to determine which of the given shapes cannot be made using the T-shaped cardboard pieces. The T-shaped piece consists of a central square with three additional squares attached to its top, left, and right sides.

Let's examine each option:

- **Option A**: This shape consists of a horizontal line of three squares attached to the central column of three squares. This can be made by placing two T-shaped pieces side by side, with their tops, left, and right squares forming the horizontal line.

- **Option B**: This shape is an inverted L-shape and can be constructed by rotating the T-shape and placing it appropriately to form an inverted L.

- **Option C**: This shape is an L-shape. It can be created by rotating the T-shape to align its top, left, and right extensions to form a proper L-shape.

- **Option D**: This shape is also an L-shape, similar to option C, but mirrored. It can be constructed by rotating and mirroring the T-shape as needed.

- **Option E**: This shape is a 3x3 square. This cannot be made using the T-shaped pieces because there is no way to fill the center square of the 3x3 grid without overlapping or leaving gaps.

Given this analysis, the shape in option E cannot be constructed using the T-shaped pieces.

Reasoning: The T-shaped piece cannot form a 3x3 square without overlapping or leaving gaps.

Answer: E).
