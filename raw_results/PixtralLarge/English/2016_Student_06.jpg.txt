To determine the minimum number of planes necessary to border a certain region in a three-dimensional space, we need to consider the geometry of the region and how planes can intersect to enclose it.

**Reasoning**:
In three-dimensional space, a region can be enclosed by planes in a manner similar to how a polyhedron is enclosed by its faces. The simplest polyhedron that can enclose a region is a tetrahedron, which has four faces. However, to fully border a region, we need to consider how planes intersect. For example, a cube requires six faces (planes) to be fully enclosed. Thus, the minimum number of planes necessary to border a certain region in three-dimensional space is more than four but less than the number needed for more complex shapes.

**Answer**: D).
