**Reasoning**: To analyze question 5, we need to determine the order in which the three people walked through the snow based on their boot prints. The prints that are most intact and clear would be the ones made last as they would not have been stepped on by others. Conversely, the prints that are least clear or interrupted would be the ones made first, as they would have been stepped on by the other two individuals.

Looking at the image, we can see three distinct types of boot prints:
1. Dotted sole prints
2. Striped sole prints
3. Prints with a distinct mark on the heel

Starting from the left, we see that the dotted sole prints are mostly intact and clear. Next, the striped sole prints are somewhat overlapped by the dotted sole prints. Lastly, the prints with a distinct mark on the heel are the least clear, indicating that they were stepped on by the other two types of prints.

From this observation, the order of walking would be:
1. The prints with a distinct mark on the heel (walked first and were stepped on by the others).
2. The striped sole prints (walked second and were stepped on by the dotted sole prints).
3. The dotted sole prints (walked last and are mostly intact).

Based on the options given:
- Option (A) shows dotted sole, striped sole, distinct mark on heel.
- Option (B) shows dotted sole, distinct mark on heel, striped sole.
- Option (C) shows striped sole, dotted sole, distinct mark on heel.
- Option (D) shows distinct mark on heel, striped sole, dotted sole.
- Option (E) shows distinct mark on heel, dotted sole, striped sole.

The correct order is distinct mark on heel, striped sole, dotted sole, which matches option (D).

**Answer**: D).
