**Reasoning**: Initially, all five sparrows are facing the same direction. Azra whistles four times, meaning she can see four other sparrows in front of her. This implies Azra is at one end of the rope. The situation changes when one sparrow turns around. Now, every sparrow whistles according to the number of sparrows they can see in front of them.

- If Azra turned around, she would see three sparrows in front of her, so she would whistle three times.
- If Bernhard turned around, he would see three sparrows in front of him, so he would whistle three times.
- If Christa turned around, she would see two sparrows in front of her, so she would whistle two times.
- If David turned around, he would see one sparrow in front of him, so he would whistle once.
- If Elsa turned around, she would see four sparrows in front of her, so she would whistle four times.

The total number of whistles the first time was 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10, and the second time should be more than 10. If Elsa turned around, the second total would be 4 (Azra) + 3 (Bernhard) + 2 (Christa) + 1 (David) + 4 (Elsa) = 14, which is more than the first total of 10.
