**Reasoning**:
1. Each of the four squares is divided into four smaller triangular or quadrilateral sections.
2. To determine the total area of the black parts, we need to look at the proportion of black regions in each square.

- **Square A**: Half of the square is black. The black area is 2 out of 4 triangular sections.
- **Square B**: Half of the square is black. The black area is 2 out of 4 triangular sections.
- **Square C**: Half of the square is black. The black area is 2 out of 4 triangular sections.
- **Square D**: Half of the square is black. The black area is 2 out of 4 triangular sections.

Since all four squares have half of their area colored in black, the total area of the black parts is equally big in all four squares.

**Answer**: E)
