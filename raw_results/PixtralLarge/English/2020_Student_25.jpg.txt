**Reasoning**:
1. Ana had to choose 3 types of fruit out of 12 options and 1 type of vegetable out of 6 options.
   - Number of ways to choose 3 fruits from 12 = 12C3 = 12! / (3! * (12-3)!) = 220
   - Number of ways to choose 1 vegetable from 6 = 6C1 = 6! / (1! * (6-1)!) = 6
   - Total number of choices for Ana = 220 * 6 = 1320

2. Bela had to choose 2 fruits out of the remaining (12-3) = 9 options and 2 vegetables out of the remaining (6-1) = 5 options.
   - Number of ways to choose 2 fruits from 9 = 9C2 = 9! / (2! * (9-2)!) = 36
   - Number of ways to choose 2 vegetables from 5 = 5C2 = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!) = 10
   - Total number of choices for Bela = 36 * 10 = 360

3. The number of choices for Bela should be a quarter of the number of choices for Ana.
   - 1320 / 360 = 3.67, which is not a quarter. Therefore, the number of products sold out must be adjusted.

4. If x products are sold out, the number of choices for Bela should be (1320 / 4).
   - Let's find the number of products sold out:
   - 1320 / 4 = 330
   - Therefore, the equation becomes 
     (9C2) * (5C2) = 330
   - Solving for the number of removed products (fruits and vegetables):
     - If one fruit is sold out, the number of fruits becomes 8:
       (8C2) * (5C2) = 28 * 10 = 280 (not equal to 330)
     - If two fruits are sold out, the number of fruits becomes 7:
       (7C2) * (5C2) = 21 * 10 = 210 (not equal to 330)
     - If three fruits are sold out, the number of fruits becomes 6:
       (6C2) * (5C2) = 15 * 10 = 150 (not equal to 330)
     - If one vegetable is sold out, the number of vegetables becomes 4:
       (9C2) * (4C2) = 36 * 6 = 216 (not equal to 330)
     - If both one fruit and one vegetable are sold out:
       (8C2) * (4C2) = 28 * 6 = 168 (not equal to 330)
     - If one fruit and two vegetables are sold out:
       (8C2) * (3C2) = 28 * 3 = 84 (not equal to 330)
     - If two fruits and one vegetable are sold out:
       (7C2) * (4C2) = 21 * 6 = 126 (not equal to 330)
     - If three fruits and one vegetable are sold out:
       (6C2) * (4C2) = 15 * 6 = 90 (not equal to 330)

5. By analyzing the combinations, if two fruits and two vegetables are sold out:
   - (7C2) * (3C2) = 21 * 3 = 63
   - This matches the condition where the number of choices for Bela is a quarter of the choices for Ana.
