**Reasoning**:
1. The initial pattern consists of white, grey, and black squares.
2. Anni replaces all black squares with white squares.
3. Bob then replaces all grey squares with black squares.
4. Finally, Chris replaces all white squares with grey squares.

Let's analyze the transformation step-by-step:
- **Original Pattern**: [Black, White, Grey, White, Grey, Black, White]
- **Step 1 (Anni)**: Replace black squares with white squares: [White, White, Grey, White, Grey, White, White]
- **Step 2 (Bob)**: Replace grey squares with black squares: [White, White, Black, White, Black, White, White]
- **Step 3 (Chris)**: Replace white squares with grey squares: [Grey, Grey, Black, Grey, Black, Grey, Grey]

This final pattern matches option (D).
