**Reasoning**:
1. David plans to travel a certain distance and arrive at exactly 15:00 hours.
2. He covers 2/3 of the planned travel time but only manages to cover 3/4 of the way.
3. This means he was on track to arrive earlier if he had continued at his initial speed.
4. Since he arrives exactly on time, he must have slowed down for the remaining 1/4 of the journey.
5. If we let the total distance be 1 unit, he covered 3/4 of it at a faster speed and the remaining 1/4 at a slower speed.
6. The time taken for the first 3/4 of the journey is 2/3 of the total time.
7. The time taken for the last 1/4 of the journey is 1/3 of the total time.
8. Let the speeds for the two sections be \(v_1\) and \(v_2\), respectively.
9. The distance-time relationship for the two sections gives us:
   - For the first 3/4 of the journey: \( \frac{3}{4} = v_1 \times \frac{2}{3} \)
   - For the last 1/4 of the journey: \( \frac{1}{4} = v_2 \times \frac{1}{3} \)
10. Solving these equations:
    - \( v_1 = \frac{3}{4} \div \frac{2}{3} = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{9}{8} \)
    - \( v_2 = \frac{1}{4} \div \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 = \frac{3}{4} \)
11. The ratio of the average speeds of the two sections is \( v_1 : v_2 = \frac{9}{8} : \frac{3}{4} \).
12. Simplifying the ratio:
    - \( \frac{\frac{9}{8}}{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{9}{8} \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{9 \times 4}{8 \times 3} = \frac{36}{24} = \frac{3}{2} \)
13. Therefore, the ratio of the average speeds is \( \frac{3}{2} : 1 \), which corresponds to option (C).
