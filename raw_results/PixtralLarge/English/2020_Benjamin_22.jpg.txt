**Reasoning**:
1. The problem is to determine the maximum number of cubes Ana can remove without modifying the three views shown (front, right side, and above).
2. The front view shows 12 cubes.
3. The right side view also shows 12 cubes.
4. The above view shows 12 cubes.
5. To determine the maximum number of cubes that can be removed while maintaining these views, we need to consider the overlap and hidden cubes.
6. The front view has 4 rows with heights 1, 3, 3, and 1, totaling 8 visible cubes.
7. The right side view has 4 columns with heights 3, 1, 3, and 1, totaling 8 visible cubes.
8. The above view shows a 3x3 square with 1 missing cube, totaling 8 visible cubes.
9. Considering the overlap and hidden cubes, the total number of cubes in the construction is 18 (since some cubes are counted in multiple views).
10. To maintain the views, Ana can remove the cubes that are not visible in any of the three views.
11. There are 18 cubes in total, and 12 are visible in each view. Therefore, the maximum number of cubes Ana can remove without modifying the views is 18 - 12 = 6.
12. However, the question asks for the maximum number of cubes Ana can remove without modifying the views, which means we need to consider the maximum possible cubes that can be removed while maintaining the views.
13. Given the options, the closest number that matches the maximum possible cubes Ana can remove without modifying the views is 18.

**Answer**: C).
