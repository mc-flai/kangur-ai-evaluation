To determine the number of different ways Ahmad can reach the top step, we need to consider the possible combinations of steps he can take. Ahmad can take 1 or 2 steps at a time, but he cannot use the 6th step due to the hole.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Total Steps Required**: Ahmad needs to reach the 8th step.
2. **Possible Movements**: He can move 1 or 2 steps at a time.
3. **Constraints**: He cannot use the 6th step.

We need to find all possible combinations of 1-steps and 2-steps that add up to 8, ensuring that none of these combinations include the 6th step.

Let's enumerate the possibilities:

- **8 one-steps**: Not possible because it uses the 6th step.
- **6 one-steps and 1 two-steps**: Not possible because it uses the 6th step.
- **4 one-steps and 2 two-steps**:
  - 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1 (Valid)
  - 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 (Valid)
  - 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1 (Valid)
  - 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1 (Valid)
  - 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1 (Valid)
  - 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1 (Valid)
- **2 one-steps and 3 two-steps**:
  - 1, 2, 2, 1, 2 (Valid)
  - 2, 1, 2, 2, 1 (Valid)
  - 2, 2, 1, 2, 1 (Valid)
  - 2, 2, 2, 1, 1 (Valid)
  - 1, 2, 2, 2, 1 (Valid)
  - 1, 2, 1, 2, 2 (Valid)
  - 2, 1, 2, 1, 2 (Valid)
  - 2, 1, 1, 2, 2 (Valid)
  - 1, 1, 2, 2, 2 (Valid)
- **0 one-steps and 4 two-steps**:
  - 2, 2, 2, 2 (Valid)

Total combinations are:
- 6 (4 one-steps and 2 two-steps)
- 9 (2 one-steps and 3 two-steps)
- 1 (0 one-steps and 4 two-steps)

Total = 6 + 9 + 1 = 16

However, we need to check if we missed any invalid combinations:

- **4 one-steps and 2 two-steps**: Valid combinations are 6
- **2 one-steps and 3 two-steps**: Valid combinations are 9
- **0 one-steps and 4 two-steps**: Valid combinations are 1

Therefore, the correct answer is 9.

Reasoning: By enumerating all possible combinations of 1-steps and 2-steps that sum to 8 while avoiding the 6th step, we find there are 9 valid ways.
Answer: D)
