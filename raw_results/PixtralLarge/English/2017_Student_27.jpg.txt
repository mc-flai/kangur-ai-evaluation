**Reasoning**:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have a 3x3 grid filled with nine whole numbers.
   - The sum of these nine numbers is 500.
   - Adjacent cells with a common side have numbers differing by exactly 1.

2. **Identifying the Pattern**:
   - The middle cell will have the median value among the numbers around it.
   - The numbers in the cells surrounding the middle cell will form a sequence differing by 1.

3. **Calculating the Ranges**:
   - The numbers should be centered around the median value, with possible variations being +1 and -1 from the median.
   - For the sum to be 500 and with the differences of 1, the numbers must be around the center value.

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - If the middle number is \( x \), the numbers around it will be \( x-1 \), \( x \), and \( x+1 \).
   - The sum of these numbers in the central 3x3 area may be represented as \( (x-1) + x + (x+1) = 3x \).
   - Given there are 9 numbers in total, and they are symmetrically placed around the middle number, the sum of all 9 numbers can be calculated.

5. **Finding the Middle Number**:
   - Total sum of nine numbers = 500.
   - Thus, if the numbers are symmetrically dispersed around the middle number and follow the difference of 1 rule, the average number can be calculated by dividing the total sum by 9.
   - \[
   \text{Average number} = \frac{500}{9} \approx 55.56
   \]
   - Since we are dealing with whole numbers, the middle number will most likely be 55 or 56.
   - Considering the complete grid and the fact that there are 9 numbers, the middle number should be 55 (as it balances the distribution evenly around this number).
