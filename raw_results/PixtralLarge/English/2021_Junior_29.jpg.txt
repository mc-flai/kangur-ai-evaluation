**Reasoning**:
1. Let's denote the weights of the eight coins as \( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8 \) in ascending order such that \( a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < a_4 < a_5 < a_6 < a_7 < a_8 \).
2. According to the problem, the side containing the heaviest of the four coins is always heavier. This implies that the heaviest coin, \( a_8 \), must be balanced against the combined weight of the other coins.
3. To ensure that \( a_8 \) is always the heaviest, it must be heavier than the sum of any three of the lighter coins.
4. The smallest possible weight for \( a_8 \) must be greater than the sum of the three smallest coins \( a_1, a_2, \) and \( a_3 \).
5. To find the minimum weight of \( a_8 \), we need to consider the smallest three coins such that \( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 < a_8 \).
6. Given the options:
   - \( 8 \) grams
   - \( 12 \) grams
   - \( 34 \) grams
   - \( 128 \) grams
   - \( 256 \) grams

   The smallest weight that ensures the condition \( a_8 > a_1 + a_2 + a_3 \) is 34 grams, as it is the smallest weight among the options that guarantees the heaviest coin is always the heavier side when balanced against other combinations of coins.
