To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of people that do not wear a hat, given the condition that each person who wears a hat can either speak the truth or lie. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

1. There are 30 people sitting around a round table.
2. People who do not wear a hat always speak the truth.
3. People who wear a hat can either speak the truth or lie.
4. Each person claims: "At least one of my two neighboring people wears a hat."

We need to determine the largest number of people who do not wear a hat.

### Analyzing the Statements:
- If a person who does not wear a hat says, "At least one of my two neighboring people wears a hat," this statement must be true.
- If a person who wears a hat says, "At least one of my two neighboring people wears a hat," this statement can be true or false.

### Strategy:
- Let's consider the smallest number of people wearing hats such that the condition is satisfied.
- If there are at least 2 people wearing hats next to each other, the person between them can be a non-hat wearer and still satisfy the condition.

### Configuration:
- If we arrange the 30 people in a sequence and ensure that no three consecutive people are without hats, we can minimize the number of people wearing hats.
- One possible configuration is to place people wearing hats every two people. This would mean that for every three people, one wears a hat.

### Calculation:
- If we place one hat-wearer every third person, we would have:
  - 10 hat-wearers (since 30 divided by 3 is 10).
- This leaves 20 people who do not wear hats.

### Verification:
- Each non-hat wearer has at least one neighbor wearing a hat, satisfying the condition.
- This configuration ensures that the statement made by each person is consistent with the rules given.

### Conclusion:
The biggest number of people that do not wear a hat is 20.

Reasoning: By placing one hat-wearer every third person, we ensure that the condition is satisfied with the minimum number of hat-wearers, leaving the maximum number of non-hat wearers.
Answer: D).
