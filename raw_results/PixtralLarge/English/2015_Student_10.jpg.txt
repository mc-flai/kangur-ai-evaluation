**Reasoning**:
1. Observe the original square and how it's folded along the dashed lines.
2. The folds create smaller squares within the original square.
3. One corner of the resulting smaller square is cut off.
4. When the paper is unfolded, the cut-off corner will result in a hole in the inner area of each smaller square.
5. Since there are 4 folds along the dashed lines in both vertical and horizontal directions, the paper will result in 9 smaller squares when completely unfolded.
6. Each smaller square will have one hole due to the corner being cut off.
7. Therefore, the total number of holes on the inner area of the piece of paper is 9.

**Answer**: E)
