To determine which part of the given options represents the grey part of the structure formed by 18 cubes colored white, grey, or black, observe the following:

1. The provided image shows a 3x3x2 cube arrangement.
2. The top layer consists of white and black cubes.
3. The bottom layer consists of grey cubes.

Given the options (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E), we need to identify which arrangement correctly represents the grey portion of the cube structure.

- **Option (A)**: Shows a set of grey cubes.
- **Option (B)**: Shows a different set of grey cubes.
- **Option (C)**: Shows another set of grey cubes.
- **Option (D)**: Shows yet another set of grey cubes.
- **Option (E)**: Shows a final set of grey cubes.

By carefully examining the structure of the grey part in the original image and comparing it with the given options, we can identify that the grey part consists of 9 cubes placed in a specific pattern that matches option (C).

Reasoning: The grey part, being the bottom layer of the cube structure, matches the arrangement shown in option (C).

Answer: C)
