To determine the correct answer for the obtuse interior angles in the rhombuses, consider the properties of a rhombus (or diamond shape) within the context of a regular octagon.

**Reasoning:**
- A regular octagon has interior angles of 135 degrees.
- Each rhombus in the image is formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the octagon, creating four equal rhombuses.
- In a regular octagon, the angle between two adjacent sides (at a vertex) is 135 degrees.
- Therefore, each rhombus has obtuse interior angles that are supplementary to the interior angles of the octagon.
- Calculate the obtuse interior angle of each rhombus: 180 degrees - 135 degrees = 45 degrees.
- However, since the rhombus is symmetrical and we are looking for the obtuse angle, it should be 180 degrees - 45 degrees = 135 degrees.
- Thus, the obtuse interior angles in the rhombuses are 135 degrees.

**Answer:** A) 135Â°
