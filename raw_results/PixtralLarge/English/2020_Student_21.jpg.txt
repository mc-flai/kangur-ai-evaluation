To determine which statement is true based on the figure provided, we need to analyze the given equations and their graphical representations.

1. **Interpret the Graph**:
   - Line \( r \) is horizontal, suggesting it has a constant \( y \)-value. The equation for line \( r \) is \( y = ax + b \).
   - Line \( s \) has a positive slope and a positive \( y \)-intercept, suggesting its equation is \( y = cx + d \) where both \( c \) and \( d \) are positive.

2. **Analyze the Statements**:
   - **Statement A**: \( ab + cd < 0 \)
     - Given that \( b \) is the \( y \)-intercept of line \( r \) and since \( y = ax + b \) is horizontal, \( a = 0 \). Thus, \( ab = 0 \).
     - For line \( s \), \( c \) and \( d \) are both positive, so \( cd > 0 \).
     - Therefore, \( ab + cd = 0 + positive = positive \), which means \( ab + cd > 0 \). Statement A is false.
   - **Statement B**: \( a + b + c + d < 0 \)
     - Since \( a = 0 \) and \( b, c, \) and \( d \) are all positive, the sum \( a + b + c + d \) is positive. Statement B is false.
   - **Statement C**: \( ac + bd \geq 0 \)
     - \( a = 0 \), so \( ac = 0 \).
     - Since \( b \) and \( d \) are both positive, \( bd > 0 \).
     - Therefore, \( ac + bd = 0 + positive = positive \), so \( ac + bd \geq 0 \). Statement C is true.
   - **Statement D**: \( a + b + c + d > 0 \)
     - As explained previously, the sum \( a + b + c + d \) is positive. Statement D is true.
   - **Statement E**: \( abcd > 0 \)
     - Since \( a = 0 \), the product \( abcd = 0 \). Statement E is false.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - From the analysis, the true statement is C.

Reasoning: Analyzed the given equations and their graphical representations to determine the correct statement based on the values of \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \).

Answer: C).
