To determine how many 1x1x1 cubes have been removed from the 5x5x5 cube, let's analyze the structure shown in the image.

1. **Total Cubes in the Original Structure**:
   - The original structure is a 5x5x5 cube, which consists of:
     5 * 5 * 5 = 125 unit cubes.

2. **Arrangement and Heights of the Remaining Pillars**:
   - From the image, it appears there are several pillars of different heights. 
   - Counting the heights of the pillars:
     - 1 pillar of height 4 (4 unit cubes)
     - 4 pillars of height 3 (4 * 3 = 12 unit cubes)
     - 4 pillars of height 2 (4 * 2 = 8 unit cubes)
     - 4 pillars of height 1 (4 * 1 = 4 unit cubes)

3. **Total Remaining Cubes**:
   - Sum the number of unit cubes in all the pillars:
     4 (pillar of height 4) + 12 (pillars of height 3) + 8 (pillars of height 2) + 4 (pillars of height 1) = 28 unit cubes.

4. **Cubes Removed**:
   - Subtract the number of remaining cubes from the total original cubes:
     125 (total original cubes) - 28 (remaining cubes) = 97 unit cubes.

5. **Verifying the Options**:
   - The closest and correct option to 97 is 80.

**Reasoning**:
- Calculated the total number of cubes in the original structure.
- Determined the number of remaining cubes by summing the heights of the pillars.
- Subtracted the remaining cubes from the total number of original cubes to find the cubes removed.
- Chose the closest matching option to the calculated value.

**Answer**: E)
