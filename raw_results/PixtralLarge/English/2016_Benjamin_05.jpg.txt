To determine the area of the smaller square formed by joining the midpoints of each side of a larger square with a side length of 10 cm, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the diagonal length of the larger square**:
   - The diagonal of a square can be calculated using the formula \( d = s\sqrt{2} \), where \( s \) is the side length.
   - For a square with side length \( 10 \) cm, the diagonal is \( 10\sqrt{2} \) cm.

2. **Calculate the side length of the smaller square**:
   - The smaller square is formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the larger square.
   - The diagonals of the smaller square are the same as the sides of the larger square, which is \( 10 \) cm.
   - The side length of the smaller square can be found using the diagonal of the smaller square: \( d = s\sqrt{2} \).
   - Solving for \( s \), we get \( s = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = 10 \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\sqrt{2} \) cm.

3. **Calculate the area of the smaller square**:
   - The area of a square is given by \( s^2 \).
   - Substituting \( s = 5\sqrt{2} \), we get \( (5\sqrt{2})^2 = 25 \times 2 = 50 \) cm².

**Reasoning**: The side length of the smaller square is \( 5\sqrt{2} \) cm, and thus the area is \( 50 \) cm².

**Answer**: E).
