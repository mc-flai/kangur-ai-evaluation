**Reasoning**:

The problem requires us to find a number that, when placed in the circle marked with a question mark, will make each number in the diagram equal to the sum of its two direct neighbors. 

Let's denote the numbers in the circles as follows:

- Top circle: 3
- Top right circle: 5
- Bottom right circle: x (unknown)
- Bottom circle: y (unknown)
- Bottom left circle: z (unknown)
- Top left circle: w (unknown)

We need to determine the value of x such that:
1. 5 + x = z
2. 3 + z = 5
3. y + w = x
4. z + y = w
5. w + 3 = 5

From equation 2:
3 + z = 5
z = 5 - 3
z = 2

From equation 1:
5 + x = 2
x = 2 - 5
x = -3

Therefore, the number that Ella needs to write into the circle marked with "?" is -3.
