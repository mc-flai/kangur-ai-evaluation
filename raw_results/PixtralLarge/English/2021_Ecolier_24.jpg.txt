To determine what Martin needs to put on the left-hand side of the third set of scales to balance them, we need to analyze the given sets of scales.

From the image:
1. The first set of scales has 2 hexagons on the left side and 1 triangle plus 1 square on the right side.
2. The second set of scales has 1 triangle plus 1 hexagon on the left side and 1 hexagon plus 3 squares on the right side.

From these observations:
- 2 hexagons balance with 1 triangle plus 1 square.
- 1 triangle plus 1 hexagon balances with 1 hexagon plus 3 squares.

To balance the third set of scales, which has 2 triangles on the right side, we need to find the equivalent weight on the left side.

From the first set, we know:
- 2 hexagons = 1 triangle + 1 square.

Therefore, 2 triangles must balance with:
- 2 times (1 triangle + 1 square) - 2 triangles.

This simplifies to:
- 2 hexagons = 2 triangles.

Thus, to balance the third set of scales, Martin needs to put 2 hexagons on the left-hand side.

Reasoning: Based on the analysis of the given sets of scales and using the balancing equations derived from them, 2 hexagons balance with 2 triangles.
Answer: C).
