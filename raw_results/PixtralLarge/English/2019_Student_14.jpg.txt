To analyze question 14, we need to understand the operation defined by Michael and determine which of the provided statements is definitely true when the condition \((a \diamond b) \diamond c = a \diamond (b \diamond c)\) holds.

Michael's operation is defined as \( x \diamond y = y - x \).

First, let's simplify the expressions on both sides of the condition:

1. Calculate \((a \diamond b) \diamond c\):
\[
(a \diamond b) = b - a
\]
\[
(b - a) \diamond c = c - (b - a) = c - b + a
\]

2. Calculate \(a \diamond (b \diamond c)\):
\[
(b \diamond c) = c - b
\]
\[
a \diamond (c - b) = (c - b) - a = c - b - a
\]

Now, equate the two expressions:
\[
c - b + a = c - b - a
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
a = -a
\]
\[
2a = 0
\]
\[
a = 0
\]

Now, we need to determine which statement is definitely true if \(a = 0\):

- (A) \(a = b\): Not necessarily true since \(b\) can be any value.
- (B) \(b = c\): Not necessarily true since \(b\) and \(c\) can be any values.
- (C) \(a = c\): Not necessarily true since \(c\) can be any value.
- (D) \(a = 0\): This is definitely true based on our derivation.
- (E) \(c = 0\): Not necessarily true since \(c\) can be any value.

Reasoning: The condition simplifies to \(a = 0\), making statement (D) definitely true.

Answer: D).
