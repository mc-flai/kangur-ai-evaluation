To determine how many small white cubes Jack used, we need to analyze the given information and the conditions:

1. **Total number of cubes**: Jack has 27 small cubes in total, forming a larger cube.
2. **Color restriction**: No two small cubes of the same color can be placed next to each other.

Given that the cube is a 3x3x3 structure (since it consists of 27 small cubes), we need to ensure that adjacent cubes have different colors.

To think through this problem, consider the placement of the cubes in a 3x3x3 configuration:

- In a 3x3x3 cube, each face of the cube will have 9 small cubes.
- The colors must alternate to comply with the condition that no two adjacent cubes can have the same color.

Visualizing the cube:
- Each face must have a checkerboard pattern of grey and white cubes to meet the alternating color condition.
- For a checkerboard pattern in a 3x3 grid, there will be more of one color than the other. Specifically, there will be 5 cubes of one color and 4 cubes of the other.

So, for each face of the cube:
- There are 5 grey cubes and 4 white cubes.

Since there are 6 faces on a cube, the inner section (not visible in the diagram) must also follow the alternating pattern, contributing additional cubes.

The inner section of the cube (the middle cube in each layer) will consist of:
- 1 grey cube per layer, for a total of 3 layers, hence 3 grey cubes.

Summarizing:
- Each of the 6 faces has 4 white cubes.
- Therefore, the total number of white cubes is: 6 faces * 4 white cubes per face = 24 white cubes.

However, this is incorrect because we have not accounted for the alternating pattern in the internal section. The correct pattern for the internal section ensures that there are fewer white cubes.

Upon reevaluation:
- Each face has 4 white cubes, but the internal section will have fewer white cubes as they will be grey to maintain the alternating pattern.
- Correcting the total count: 6 faces * 4 white cubes per face = 24 white cubes minus the internal white cubes.

Hence, the correct number of white cubes is 14.

**Reasoning**: The cube is a 3x3x3 structure with alternating colors. Each face has 4 white cubes, with a total of 6 faces, and the internal section also contributes fewer white cubes due to the alternating pattern.

**Answer**: D) 14.
