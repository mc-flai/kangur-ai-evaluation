To determine the correct answer for question 7, we need to visually compare the large picture of the flowers on the right side of the image with the smaller options (A) through (E). The task is to identify which smaller picture matches the large picture when viewed from the outside.

**Reasoning:**
1. Observe the large picture of the flowers. Note the distinct features such as the shape and arrangement of the flowers and leaves.
2. Compare each smaller option (A through E) with the large picture.
3. Option A has a different arrangement of the flowers.

5. Option C matches the large picture in terms of the arrangement and number of flowers and leaves.
6. Option D has a different arrangement of the flowers.
7. Option E has a different arrangement and number of flowers.

Based on this comparison, the correct answer that matches the large picture is option C.
