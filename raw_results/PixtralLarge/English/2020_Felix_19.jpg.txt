**Reasoning**:
1. Tania bought 14 chocolates in total.
2. Out of these, 8 are round and 6 are square.
3. Half of the 14 chocolates are white, and the other half are dark. So, there are 7 white chocolates and 7 dark chocolates.
4. Among the 6 square chocolates, 2 are not white, which means they are dark.
5. Therefore, the number of dark square chocolates is 2.
6. The total number of dark chocolates is 7.
7. Since we know 2 of the dark chocolates are square, the remaining dark chocolates must be round.
8. The number of dark round chocolates is 7 (total dark chocolates) - 2 (dark square chocolates) = 5.

**Answer**: D)
