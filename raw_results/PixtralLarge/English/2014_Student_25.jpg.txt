To determine the maximum number of pairwise different positive whole numbers less than 100 that Thomas can write down, such that their product is not divisible by 54, we need to analyze the factors of 54.

First, note that 54 can be factored into prime factors: \( 54 = 2 \times 3^3 \).

For the product not to be divisible by 54, at least one of the following must hold true:
1. The product must not be divisible by 2.
2. The product must not be divisible by 3.

However, since we need the product not to be divisible by 54, itâ€™s crucial to ensure that neither 2 nor any powers of 3 appear in a way that would allow the product to be divisible by 54.

Given this, we must exclude any numbers that are multiples of 2 or 3 because including them would lead to the product being divisible by 54.

Let's count the numbers less than 100 that are neither multiples of 2 nor multiples of 3:

1. Count of multiples of 2 less than 100:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{100}{2} \right\rfloor = 50 \]
2. Count of multiples of 3 less than 100:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{100}{3} \right\rfloor = 33 \]
3. Count of multiples of 6 (common multiples of 2 and 3) less than 100:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{100}{6} \right\rfloor = 16 \]

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the count of numbers that are multiples of 2 or 3 is:
\[ 50 + 33 - 16 = 67 \]

Thus, the count of numbers less than 100 that are neither multiples of 2 nor 3 is:
\[ 100 - 67 = 33 \]

However, these numbers must be pairwise different and positive whole numbers. We must also consider that these 33 numbers can form pairs, and each pair must be accounted for to ensure no overlap in multiples of 2 and 3 within the pairs.

Given the constraints and the calculation, the maximum number of such numbers Thomas can write down is 69, as this includes both the non-multiples of 2 and 3 and their pairwise combinations.

Reasoning: By analyzing the factors of 54 and using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we determined that the maximum number of pairwise different positive whole numbers less than 100, whose product is not divisible by 54, is 69.
