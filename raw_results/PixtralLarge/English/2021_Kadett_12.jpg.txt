To solve question 12, we need to determine the weight of the empty jar. Here's the detailed reasoning:

1. **Weight of the jar one-fifth filled with water**: 560 g.
2. **Weight of the jar four-fifths filled with water**: 740 g.

The difference in weight between the jar four-fifths filled and the jar one-fifth filled is the weight of the three-fifths of the water:
\[ 740 \, \text{g} - 560 \, \text{g} = 180 \, \text{g} \]

Since 180 g is the weight of three-fifths of the water, the weight of one-fifth of the water is:
\[ \frac{180 \, \text{g}}{3} = 60 \, \text{g} \]

Now, the weight of the empty jar is the weight of the jar one-fifth filled with water minus the weight of the one-fifth of water:
\[ 560 \, \text{g} - 60 \, \text{g} = 500 \, \text{g} \]

Thus, the weight of the empty jar is 500 g.

Reasoning: The weight of the jar one-fifth filled minus the weight of one-fifth of the water gives the weight of the empty jar.
Answer: E).
