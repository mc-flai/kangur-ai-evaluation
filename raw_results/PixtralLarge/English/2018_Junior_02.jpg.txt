To determine the length of the longest chain built with the partially interlinked rings that also includes the thick light ring, follow these steps:

1. Observe the image to see how the rings are interlinked.
2. Identify the thick light ring within the interlinked structure.
3. Trace the chain that includes the thick light ring and count the total number of rings it passes through.

From the image, let's count the rings in the chain that includes the thick light ring:
- The thick light ring is interlinked with a ring above it.
- That ring is interlinked with a ring to the left of it.
- This left ring is interlinked with another ring below it.
- This lower ring is interlinked with another ring to the right of it.
- This right ring is interlinked with the bottom ring.
- The bottom ring is interlinked with the ring on the far right.

Therefore, the total number of rings in the longest chain that includes the thick light ring is 6.

Reasoning: Counting the rings step by step from the thick light ring through the interlinked structure shows a total of 6 rings.
