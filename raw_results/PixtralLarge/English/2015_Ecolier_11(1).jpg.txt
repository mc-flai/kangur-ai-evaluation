To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of small, white cubes Jack used given the conditions that:
1. Jack makes a cube from 27 small cubes.
2. The small cubes are either grey or white.
3. Two small cubes with the same colour are not allowed to be placed next to each other.

Letâ€™s analyze the structure of the cube:
- The cube is a 3x3x3 arrangement of small cubes because 3^3 = 27.
- Each face of the cube is a 3x3 grid.

To satisfy the condition that no two cubes of the same colour are next to each other, we need to alternate the colours.

**Step-by-step analysis:**

1. **Identify the pattern on a single face of the cube:**
   Each face of the cube must be arranged in a checkerboard pattern (alternating grey and white cubes) to ensure no two adjacent cubes are the same colour.

2. **Determine the positioning of cubes:**
    - For a 3x3 grid, the central cube must be different from its neighboring cubes.
    - If the central cube is white, then the 4 adjacent cubes (top, bottom, left, right) must be grey.
    - The corner cubes must then be white to alternate the colours.

3. **Count the white cubes in one layer:**
    - In a 3x3 grid, with the central cube being white, the four corner cubes are also white.
    - This gives us 5 white cubes per layer.

4. **Extend this pattern to the entire cube:**
    - There are 3 layers in the cube.
    - Each layer has 5 white cubes.
    - Therefore, the total number of white cubes in the c3x3x3 cube is 5 white cubes per layer * 3 layers = 15 white cubes.

**Reasoning:**
By analyzing the 3x3x3 cube and ensuring no two adjacent cubes are the same colour, we find that each layer has 5 white cubes, leading to a total of 15 white cubes in the entire cube.

**Answer:** E)
