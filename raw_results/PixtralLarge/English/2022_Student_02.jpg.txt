To solve this problem, we need to determine how many positive three-digit numbers are divisible by 13.

First, identify the range of three-digit numbers divisible by 13. The smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest three-digit number is 999.

Next, find the smallest and largest three-digit numbers that are divisible by 13:
- The smallest three-digit number divisible by 13 is found by dividing 100 by 13 and rounding up to the nearest whole number, then multiplying by 13.
  - 100 ÷ 13 ≈ 7.69, so the smallest whole number divisible by 13 is 8.
  - 8 × 13 = 104.

- The largest three-digit number divisible by 13 is found by dividing 999 by 13 and rounding down to the nearest whole number, then multiplying by 13.
  - 999 ÷ 13 ≈ 76.84, so the largest whole number divisible by 13 is 76.
  - 76 × 13 = 988.

Now, count the number of multiples of 13 between 104 and 988:
- The sequence of multiples of 13 starting from 104 is: 104, 117, 130, ..., 988.
- To find the total number of terms in this sequence, use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: 
  - Number of terms = (last term - first term) / common difference + 1
  - Number of terms = (988 - 104) / 13 + 1
  - Number of terms = (884) / 13 + 1
  - Number of terms = 68 + 1 = 69.

Therefore, there are 69 positive three-digit numbers divisible by 13.

Reasoning: The smallest three-digit number divisible by 13 is 104, and the largest is 988. The total number of multiples of 13 in this range is 69.
Answer: B).
