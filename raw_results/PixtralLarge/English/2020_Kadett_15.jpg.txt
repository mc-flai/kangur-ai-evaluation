**Reasoning**: The problem involves finding the length of the smaller diagonal of a parallelogram that is inscribed within a 12-meter square. Since the parallelogram is divided into three equal areas and its smaller diagonal is parallel to two sides of the square, this diagonal will span the entire length of one side of the square. Therefore, the length of this diagonal is equal to the side length of the square, which is 12 meters.
