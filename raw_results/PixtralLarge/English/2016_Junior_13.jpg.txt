To determine the missing result in the knock-out tennis tournament, we need to analyze the given results and deduce the missing match logically.

**Given results:**
1. Bella beats Ann
2. Gina beats Celine
3. Celine beats Donna
4. Celine beats Bella
5. Gina beats Holly
6. Emma beats Farah

In a knock-out tournament:
- There are 4 quarterfinals, 2 semifinals, and 1 final match.
- Since there are 7 matches, and we know 6, we need to determine the 7th match.

From the given results, we can deduce the following:
- Bella, Celine, Gina, and Emma have won one match each.
- Gina has won two matches (against Celine and Holly).

Since Gina has won two matches, her next match should be a semifinal. The possible opponents for Gina in the semifinal could be Bella or Emma.

Given that Celine beats Bella, Bella can't be in the final. Therefore, Bella must lose to Gina in the semifinal.

**Reasoning:**
- Gina beats Bella in the semifinal.

**Answer:** A)

Thus, the missing result is:
**Answer: A)**
