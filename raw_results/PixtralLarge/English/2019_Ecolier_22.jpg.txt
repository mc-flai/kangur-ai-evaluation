To determine the minimum number of triangles Marta used to create the star in the image, let's analyze the structure of the star.

1. The star consists of overlapping triangles that come together to form the shape shown.
2. The star appears to have five points, indicating that at least five triangles are needed to create those points.
3. To verify, consider each triangular section forming a point of the star and how they overlap to form the central part of the star.

Thus, the minimum number of triangles needed is five.

Reasoning: The star has five points, and each point is formed by a triangle. Additionally, the overlapping nature of these triangles necessitates at least five triangles to complete the star shape.

Answer: D
