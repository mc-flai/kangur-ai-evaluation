**Reasoning**: The problem states that each of the 9 sides of the triangles must be colored blue, green, or red, with three sides already colored (one blue, two red). Each triangle must have sides in three different colors.

Let's analyze the possible colors for side x:

1. If side x is colored blue, then the left triangle would have two blue sides (since one side is already blue), which is not allowed.
2. If side x is colored red, then the right triangle would have two red sides (since one side is already red), which is not allowed.
3. If side x is colored green, both triangles would have sides with three different colors (blue, red, green), which satisfies the requirement.

Therefore, side x must be colored green.

**Answer**: B)
