**Reasoning**: 
1. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 need to be placed in a 5-field diagram according to the rules: one number must be greater than the number below it and greater than the number to its right.
2. Let's analyze the possible placements:
   - The number 5, being the largest, must occupy the topmost position in any valid arrangement.
   - The number 1, being the smallest, should be placed at the bottom-right corner since it has to be smaller than any number above it or to its left.
   - The numbers 2, 3, and 4 must be arranged such that each number is greater than any number below it and to its right.

Considering these constraints, let's check the given options:
- (A) 3: The number 3 can be placed at various positions depending on the placement of 1, 2, 4, and 5. For example, 3 can be placed above 1 and 2 and below 4 and 5.
- (B) 4: The number 4 can also be placed at different positions, such as above 1, 2, and 3 and below 5.
- (C) 5: The number 5 can be placed at the topmost position in any valid arrangement.
- (D) 6: This number is not in the set to be arranged.
- (E) 8: This number is not in the set to be arranged.

Since the problem asks how many ways the numbers can be placed, the correct answer should represent the total number of valid configurations. By analyzing these placements, we can determine that there are multiple valid ways to place the numbers.

**Answer**: C).
