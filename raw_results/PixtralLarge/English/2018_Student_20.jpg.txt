To determine the size of angle α, we need to consider the properties of the angles formed by the two rectangles and the straight line.

1. The first rectangle forms an angle of 40° with the straight line.
2. The second rectangle forms an angle of 30° with the straight line.
3. Since the straight line is 180°, we can sum the angles formed by the two rectangles and subtract this sum from 180° to find angle α.

Mathematically:

α = 180° - (40° + 30°)
α = 180° - 70°
α = 110°

However, none of the given options match 110°. Therefore, the correct answer must be "another value."

Reasoning: The sum of the angles formed by the two rectangles is subtracted from 180° to find angle α. The calculation shows that α is 110°, which is not listed among the options, so the correct choice is "another value."
Answer: E).
