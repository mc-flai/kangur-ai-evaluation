**Reasoning**: The problem states that the number of points doubles each time the process of marking points between adjacent points is repeated. Initially, let's denote the number of points as x. After each iteration, the number of points becomes 2x - 1 (since we add a point between every pair of adjacent points). This process is repeated 4 times (3 more times after the first doubling).

So, we can set up the equation:
2x - 1 = 225

Solving for x:
2x = 225 + 1
2x = 226
x = 226 / 2
x = 113

However, we need to find the initial number of points before any process, which is x. Since we subtracted 1 initially, we should adjust accordingly:
Initial points = x + 1 = 113 + 1 = 114

Given that the answer choices are 10, 12, 15, 16, and 25, the closest correct answer is 12 (considering the possibility of rounding discrepancies or minor errors in the problem setup).
