To solve this problem, let's denote the father's age as F and the son's age as S. According to the problem, the product of their ages is 2015, and we need to determine the difference in their ages.

1. The equation given is:
   \[
   F \times S = 2015
   \]

2. We need to find pairs of integers (F, S) that multiply to 2015 and then calculate the difference between those pairs.

3. First, factorize 2015 into its prime factors:
   \[
   2015 = 5 \times 13 \times 31
   \]

4. Now, we need to find pairs of factors of 2015 that are both born in the 20th century (i.e., both ages must be less than 100).

   Considering the factors, we see:
   \[
   2015 = 1 \times 2015 \quad (\text{not valid as 2015 is not in the 20th century})
   \]
   \[
   2015 = 5 \times 403 \quad (\text{not valid as 403 is not in the 20th century})
   \]
   \[
   2015 = 13 \times 155 \quad (\text{not valid as 155 is not in the 20th century})
   \]
   \[
   2015 = 31 \times 65 \quad (\text{valid as both 31 and 65 are in the 20th century})
   \]

5. Therefore, the valid ages are F = 65 and S = 31.

6. The age gap between the father and the son is:
   \[
   65 - 31 = 34
   \]

Reasoning: The valid pair of ages that multiply to 2015 and are both born in the 20th century are 65 and 31. The age gap between them is 34 years.
