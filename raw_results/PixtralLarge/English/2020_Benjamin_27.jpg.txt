**Reasoning**:

Let's denote the total amount of money Janaina had initially as M Reais.

1. For the first toy, she paid half of her money plus one Real:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on the first toy} = \frac{M}{2} + 1
   \]

2. After buying the first toy, the remaining money is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = M - \left(\frac{M}{2} + 1\right) = \frac{M}{2} - 1
   \]

3. For the second toy, she paid half of the remaining money plus two Reais:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on the second toy} = \frac{\frac{M}{2} - 1}{2} + 2 = \frac{M}{4} - \frac{1}{2} + 2
   \]

4. After buying the second toy, the remaining money is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = \left(\frac{M}{2} - 1\right) - \left(\frac{M}{4} - \frac{1}{2} + 2\right) = \frac{M}{4} - \frac{3}{2}
   \]

5. For the third toy, she paid half of the remaining money plus three Reais:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on the third toy} = \frac{\frac{M}{4} - \frac{3}{2}}{2} + 3 = \frac{M}{8} - \frac{3}{4} + 3
   \]

6. After buying the third toy, the remaining money should be zero since she spent all her money:
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = \left(\frac{M}{4} - \frac{3}{2}\right) - \left(\frac{M}{8} - \frac{3}{4} + 3\right) = 0
   \]

7. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   \frac{M}{4} - \frac{3}{2} - \frac{M}{8} + \frac{3}{4} - 3 = 0
   \]

8. Combine like terms:
   \[
   \frac{M}{8} - \frac{3}{4} - 3 = 0
   \]

9. Solve for M:
   \[
   \frac{M}{8} = \frac{3}{4} + 3 = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{12}{4} = \frac{15}{4}
   \]
   \[
   M = 8 \times \frac{15}{4} = 30
   \]

10. Therefore, the total amount of money Janaina had initially is 30 + 6 (since she spent 1 + 2 + 3 Reais extra for the three toys):
   \[
   M = 30 + 6 = 36
   \]
