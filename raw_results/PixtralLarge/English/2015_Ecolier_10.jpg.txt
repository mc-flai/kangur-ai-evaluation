To determine which number is on the face opposite to the face with the number 3 on Julia's folded paper net, we need to consider the layout of the net and how it folds into a cube.

1. **Identify the faces adjacent to the face with the number 3:** 
   - The face with the number 3 is directly adjacent to the faces with the numbers 2, 4, and 6.

2. **Identify the opposite face:**
   - Since the faces with numbers 2, 4, and 6 are adjacent to the face with the number 3, they cannot be opposite it.
   - This leaves the faces with the numbers 1 and 5 as potential candidates for the face opposite the number 3.

3. **Consider the layout of the net:**
   - When folded into a cube, the face with the number 1 will be on the opposite side of the face with the number 3, because the face with the number 1 is not adjacent to the face with the number 3 in the net.

Therefore, the face with the number 1 is opposite the face with the number 3.

**Reasoning:** The number 1 is on the face that is opposite to the face with the number 3 because it is not adjacent to the number 3 in the net and all other faces are adjacent to the number 3.

**Answer:** A).
