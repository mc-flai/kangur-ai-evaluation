**Reasoning**: Mr. Hide buried his treasure at least 5 meters away from the hedge and no more than 5 meters away from the old pear tree. This means the area where the treasure could be buried is the region that is at least 5 meters away from the hedge but also within 5 meters from the old pear tree.

- Option (A) shows an area beyond 5 meters from the pear tree, so it is not correct.
- Option (B) shows regions within 5 meters from the pear tree but not considering the 5 meters distance from the hedge.
- Option (C) includes regions that are less than 5 meters away from the hedge.
- Option (D) only considers the area 5 meters away from the hedge but does not account for the distance from the pear tree.
- Option (E) shows the overlap area between 5 meters away from the hedge and within 5 meters of the pear tree, which matches the given conditions.

**Answer**: E).
