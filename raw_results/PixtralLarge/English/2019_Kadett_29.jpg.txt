To determine which fraction of the square ABCD is shaded in the diagram, we need to understand the geometric properties of the square and the shaded regions.

1. **Identify the midpoints and triangles**: The points P, Q, and R are the midpoints of the edges DA, BC, and CD, respectively. This means that each segment (DP, PQ, QR, and RD) is half the length of the corresponding side of the square.

2. **Calculate the area of the square**: Let the side length of the square be s. The area of the square ABCD is s^2.

3. **Determine the areas of the triangles**: Since P, Q, and R are midpoints, the triangles formed by these points with the vertices of the square are congruent right triangles. Each of these triangles has an area of (1/2) * (s/2) * (s/2) = s^2/8.

4. **Calculate the total shaded area**: There are four such triangles in the square, but two of them overlap in the center. Therefore, the effective area of the shaded region is the area of two triangles, which is 2 * (s^2/8) = s^2/4.

5. **Determine the fraction of the shaded area**: The fraction of the shaded area relative to the entire square is (s^2/4) / s^2 = 1/4.

Reasoning: The shaded area consists of two of the four congruent right triangles formed by the midpoints of the square's edges, resulting in a fraction of 1/4 of the total area of the square.
