**Reasoning**: The kangaroo is not allowed to jump through a square with water. Each arrow represents one jump onto a neighboring field, so the kangaroo can only jump right, left, up, or down by one square at a time. We need to find a path from the kangaroo's starting position to the koala's position without jumping into any water squares.

Let's analyze each option:

- (A): This path has the kangaroo jumping into a water square.
- (B): This path has the kangaroo jumping into a water square.
- (C): This path successfully avoids all water squares and reaches the koala.
- (D): This path has the kangaroo jumping into a water square.
- (E): This path has the kangaroo jumping into a water square.

**Answer**: C).
