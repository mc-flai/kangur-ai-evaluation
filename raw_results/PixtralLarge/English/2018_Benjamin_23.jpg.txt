To solve question 23, we need to determine the number of groups Nick can form such that the sum of the numbers in each group is as equal as possible. The numbers provided are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1. Calculate the total sum of the numbers:
   2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 54

2. To split the numbers into groups with equal sums, the sum of each group should ideally be a divisor of 54. The possible divisors of 54 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54. We need to check the largest number of groups that can be formed such that each group has an equal sum.

3. Let's start by checking the largest possible number of groups:
   - If we try to form 54 groups, each group would have a sum of 1, which is not feasible since there are only 9 numbers.
   - If we try to form 27 groups, each group would have a sum of 2. However, this is not possible since the sum of any group must be at least as large as the smallest number (which is 2).
   - If we try to form 18 groups, each group would have a sum of 3. This is also not possible for the same reason.
   - If we try to form 9 groups, each group would have a sum of 6. This is possible because the smallest number (2) and the largest number (10) can be paired to achieve this sum.

4. Forming 9 groups with a sum of 6 is feasible because we can pair the numbers as follows:
   - (2, 4)
   - (3, 3)
   - (5, 1)
   - (6)
   - (7, -1)  (Note: Since we can't have negative numbers, this pairing isn't valid.)

5. Therefore, let's check the next possible number of groups:
   - If we try to form 6 groups, each group would have a sum of 9. This is also feasible because we can pair the numbers as follows:
     - (2, 7)
     - (3, 6)
     - (4, 5)
     - (8, 1)
     - (9)
     - (10)

6. Forming 6 groups with a sum of 9 is feasible and gives us the largest number of groups.

Reasoning: By calculating the total sum of the numbers and checking the possible divisors, we determined that the largest number of groups Nick can form, such that the sum of the numbers in each group is equal, is 6.
