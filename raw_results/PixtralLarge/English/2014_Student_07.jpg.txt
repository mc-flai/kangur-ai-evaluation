**Reasoning**: To determine the number of digits in the result of the calculation \((2^{22})^5 \times (5^{55})^2\), we first simplify the exponents:

1. Simplify \( (2^{22})^5 \):
   \[
   (2^{22})^5 = 2^{22 \times 5} = 2^{110}
   \]

2. Simplify \( (5^{55})^2 \):
   \[
   (5^{55})^2 = 5^{55 \times 2} = 5^{110}
   \]

3. Combine the results:
   \[
   2^{110} \times 5^{110} = (2 \times 5)^{110} = 10^{110}
   \]

4. \(10^{110}\) is a 1 followed by 110 zeros, which means it has 111 digits.
