**Reasoning**:
The problem states that the box contains twice as many apples as pears. Christy and Lily divided the fruit such that Christy received twice as many pieces of fruit as Lily.

To determine which statement is always true, let's analyze each option:

- (A) "Christy took at least one pear."
  - This statement is not necessarily true. Christy could have taken only apples.

- (B) "Christy took twice as many apples as pears."
  - This statement is not necessarily true. The problem does not specify the distribution of types of fruit Christy took.

- (C) "Christy took twice as many apples as Lily."
  - This statement is not necessarily true. Christy could have taken any combination of fruit as long as she received twice as many pieces as Lily.

- (D) "Christy took as many apples as Lily got pears."
  - This statement can be true if we consider the total number of apples and pears. Since Christy has twice as many pieces as Lily, and there are twice as many apples as pears, the distribution will align with this statement.

- (E) "Christy took as many pears as Lily got apples."
  - This statement is not necessarily true. The problem does not specify the distribution of types of fruit Lily took.

Therefore, the statement that is always true is:
"Christy took as many apples as Lily got pears."

**Answer**: D).
