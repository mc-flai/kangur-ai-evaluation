To determine the figure on the face opposite to the kangaroo, we need to visualize the cube and the placement of each figure. The visible sides of the cube show the following:
- The side with the red square (E) is adjacent to the side with the green triangle (B).
- The side with the yellow star (C) is adjacent to the side with the green arrow (shown next to the yellow star).
- The side with the brown arrow (D) is adjacent to the side with the blue circle (A).
- The side with the kangaroo is opposite a hidden face.

We are asked to find the figure on the face opposite to the kangaroo.

Since every side is accounted for, and the blue circle (A) is the only figure not adjacent to any of the figures on the visible sides, it must be on the hidden face opposite the kangaroo.

Reasoning: By analyzing the placement of each figure on the visible sides of the cube and recognizing that the blue circle (A) is the only figure that does not have an adjacent relationship with any visible side, it must be on the face opposite to the kangaroo.

Answer: A)
