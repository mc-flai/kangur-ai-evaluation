To determine in which round team D will play against team F, we need to analyze the given schedule:

- The matches are as follows:
  1. A-B
  2. C-D
  3. A-E
  4. E-F
  5. A-C

Each team plays against every other team once, and the matches are grouped into rounds where three matches occur simultaneously.

Analyzing the schedule:

  - A plays B.
  - C plays D.
- In Round 2:
  - A plays E.
  - C plays F.
- In Round 3:
  - A plays C.
  - D plays F.
