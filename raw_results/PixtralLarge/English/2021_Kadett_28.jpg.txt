To solve this problem, let's analyze the given data and find the number of pairs that consist of two knaves.

**Given Data**:
- There are 21 knights (who always tell the truth) and 2000 knaves (who always lie).
- A wizard divided these 2021 people into 1010 pairs.
- 2000 people were called knights, and 20 people were called knaves.

**Analysis**:
- If a pair consists of two knaves, each knave would call the other a knight (since they lie). Therefore, both individuals in such a pair would be referred to as knights.
- Since 2000 people were called knights, the number of pairs where both individuals are knaves must result in 2000 people being called knights.
- Since each pair consists of two people, the number of these pairs would be half of 2000, which is 1000.

**Conclusion**:
- Therefore, there are 1000 pairs of two knaves.

Reasoning: Since 2000 people were called knights and each pair involves two people, the number of pairs with both individuals as knaves is half of 2000, which results in 1000 pairs.

Answer: E).
