**Reasoning**:
1. Mia writes three single-digit numbers on the board.
2. Ali adds these numbers and gets 15. This means the sum of the three numbers is 15.
3. Ali then deletes one of the three numbers and replaces it with the number 3.
4. Resi multiplies these three numbers and obtains 36.

To determine which number Ali could have deleted, we need to consider the numbers that sum up to 15 and, after replacing one of them with 3, result in a product of 36.

Let's denote the three numbers as a, b, and c such that:
a + b + c = 15

After replacing one number with 3, we get:
(a or b or c) * 3 * (remaining number) = 36

We need to find suitable values for a, b, and c.

Possible combinations of three single-digit numbers that sum to 15:
- 6, 6, 3
- 6, 5, 4
- 7, 4, 4
- 7, 5, 3
- 8, 4, 3

We need to check which combination, after replacing one number with 3, results in a product of 36.

Checking each combination:
- 6, 6, 3: Replacing 6 with 3 gives 3, 6, 3. Multiplying these gives 3 * 6 * 3 = 54 (not 36).
- 6, 5, 4: Replacing 6 with 3 gives 3, 5, 4. Multiplying these gives 3 * 5 * 4 = 60 (not 36).
- 7, 4, 4: Replacing 7 with 3 gives 3, 4, 4. Multiplying these gives 3 * 4 * 4 = 48 (not 36).
- 7, 5, 3: Replacing 7 with 3 gives 3, 5, 3. Multiplying these gives 3 * 5 * 3 = 45 (not 36).
- 8, 4, 3: Replacing 8 with 3 gives 3, 4, 3. Multiplying these gives 3 * 4 * 3 = 36 (correct).

Therefore, the only combination that works is 8, 4, 3, where Ali deletes 8 and replaces it with 3.
