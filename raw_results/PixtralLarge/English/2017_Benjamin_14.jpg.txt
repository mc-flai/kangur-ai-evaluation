To determine the distance Paul covers on Thursday, we need to recognize that each day he hikes 2 km more than the previous day. Let's calculate the distances for each day:

1. Monday (Day 1): Let's assume he starts with x km.
2. Tuesday (Day 2): x + 2 km.
3. Wednesday (Day 3): x + 4 km.
4. Thursday (Day 4): x + 6 km.
5. Friday (Day 5): x + 8 km.

Since the total distance covered is 70 km over five days, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 70 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 5x + 20 = 70 \]
\[ 5x = 50 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the distances for each day are:
1. Monday: 10 km
2. Tuesday: 12 km
3. Wednesday: 14 km
4. Thursday: 16 km
5. Friday: 18 km

Therefore, the distance Paul covers on Thursday is 16 km.

Reasoning: By setting up and solving the equation for the total distance covered, we find that the distance for Thursday is 16 km.
