To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cupcakes Grandma will have left after giving an equal amount to each of her six grandchildren and eating one herself.

1. First, let's determine how many cupcakes each grandchild will receive if Grandma distributes them equally.

   Total cupcakes = 23
   Number of grandchildren = 6

   Cupcakes per grandchild = 23 // 6 = 3 (quotient) with a remainder of 5 (since 23 = 6 * 3 + 5).

2. Each grandchild will receive 3 cupcakes, and the total number of cupcakes distributed to the grandchildren will be:

   3 cupcakes/grandchild * 6 grandchildren = 18 cupcakes

3. Subtract the total cupcakes given to the grandchildren from the original number of cupcakes:

   23 cupcakes - 18 cupcakes = 5 cupcakes left

4. Since Grandma will eat what is left over, she will have 5 cupcakes to eat.

Reasoning: Grandma will have 5 cupcakes left to eat after distributing 3 cupcakes to each of her six grandchildren.
