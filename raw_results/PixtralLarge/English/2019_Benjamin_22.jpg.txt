To solve question 22, we need to identify which of the pictures does not show a 2 x 1 x 1 box. 

**Reasoning**:
- The problem states that the cardboard is folded into a 2 x 1 x 1 box.
- This means we need to look at the images and see which one cannot be folded into a 2 x 1 x 1 box.

Let's analyze each option:

**Picture (A)**:
- The box has one side fully black and another side half black and half white.
- This corresponds to the pattern on the right, so it can be folded into a 2 x 1 x 1 box.

**Picture (B)**:
- The box has one side fully black and another side fully white.
- This corresponds to the pattern on the right, so it can be folded into a 2 x 1 x 1 box.

**Picture (C)**:
- The box has one side fully gray and another side half gray and half white.
- This corresponds to the pattern on the right, so it can be folded into a 2 x 1 x 1 box.

**Picture (D)**:
- The box has one side fully white and another side half gray and half white.
- This corresponds to the pattern on the right, so it can be folded into a 2 x 1 x 1 box.

**Picture (E)**:
- The box has one side fully gray and another side half gray and half black.
- This does not correspond to the pattern on the right, so it cannot be folded into a 2 x 1 x 1 box.

Only picture (E) does not match the pattern shown on the right.

**Answer**: E).
