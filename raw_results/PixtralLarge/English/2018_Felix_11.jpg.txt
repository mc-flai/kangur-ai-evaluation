**Reasoning**:
1. The problem states that the number of spots on the fly agarics indicates how many dwarfs fit under the fungi.
2. We can see one side of the fungi, and the other side has the same number of spots.
3. Thus, the total number of dwarfs that can fit under the fungi is twice the number of spots visible on one side.
4. Given that 36 dwarfs are trying to hide under the fungi, we need to find the number of spots on one side that can accommodate these dwarfs.
5. Since the spots represent the number of dwarfs that can fit, we need to find a number such that 2 * (number of spots) = 36.
6. Solving for the number of spots, we get: number of spots = 36 / 2 = 18.
7. Since none of the options show 18 spots, let's verify if other options fit the situation.
8. Option E shows 6 spots on one side, so the total number of dwarfs that can fit is 2 * 6 = 12.
9. Therefore, the number of dwarfs that will get wet is 36 - 12 = 24.

**Answer**: E).
