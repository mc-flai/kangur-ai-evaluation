**Reasoning**: To solve question 6, we need to visualize the combination of the two see-through sheets when placed on top of each other. The two individual patterns are an "L" shape and a single line starting from a dot.

When you place the "L" shape sheet on top of the single line sheet, the single line will intersect the "L" shape. The correct answer will show a combination where the single line intersects the "L" shape at a point that creates two separate segments.

Analyzing the options:
- (A) The line intersects the "L" shape but does not create two separate segments.
- (B) The line correctly intersects the "L" shape creating two separate segments.
- (C) The line intersects the "L" shape but does not create two separate segments.
- (D) The line intersects the "L" shape but does not create two separate segments.
- (E) The line intersects the "L" shape but does not create two separate segments.

Based on this analysis, the correct pattern is option (B).

**Answer**: B).
