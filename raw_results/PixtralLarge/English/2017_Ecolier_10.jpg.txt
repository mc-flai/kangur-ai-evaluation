**Reasoning**: The problem states that "Four apples and one pear weigh as much as three pears." This means we can set up an equation to represent this relationship.

Let \( A \) represent the weight of one apple and \( P \) represent the weight of one pear. The equation based on the problem statement would be:
\[ 4A + P = 3P \]

To isolate \( A \), subtract \( P \) from both sides:
\[ 4A = 2P \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ A = \frac{1}{2}P \]

This equation implies that one apple weighs as much as half a pear. Therefore, two apples weigh as much as one pear.

**Answer**: E).
