To determine the side length of the big square, we need to use the information provided in the problem. The circle touches the right side of the square in its midpoint, and the diameter of the circle is given as 8 cm.

1. **Diameter of the Circle**: The diameter of the circle is 8 cm. This means the radius (r) of the circle is half of the diameter.
   \[
   r = \frac{8 \text{ cm}}{2} = 4 \text{ cm}
   \]

2. **Understanding the Geometry**: The circle touches the right side of the square in its midpoint. This implies that the side of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.

3. **Side Length of the Big Square**: Since the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the big square, the side length of the big square is 8 cm.

Therefore, the side length of the big square is 8 cm, which corresponds to option (D).

Reasoning: The side length of the big square is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is 8 cm.
Answer: D)
