To determine the percentage change in the total number of frogs, we need to recognize that the number of blue frogs increases by 60% and the number of green frogs decreases by 60%.

Let's denote the initial number of blue frogs as \( B \) and the initial number of green frogs as \( G \). The original total number of frogs is \( B + G \).

After the changes:
- The number of blue frogs becomes \( 1.6B \) (since it increases by 60%).
- The number of green frogs becomes \( 0.4G \) (since it decreases by 60%).

The new total number of frogs is \( 1.6B + 0.4G \).

The ratio of the number of blue frogs to the number of green frogs is preserved, which means:
\[ \frac{1.6B}{0.4G} = \frac{B}{G} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \frac{1.6B}{0.4G} = 4 \times \frac{B}{G} \]

Since the ratio is preserved, the total number of frogs must remain the same to keep the ratio unchanged. Therefore, the total number of frogs remains constant.

Reasoning: The total number of frogs remains unchanged because the ratio of blue to green frogs is preserved even after the changes.

Answer: A).
