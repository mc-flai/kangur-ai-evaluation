**Reasoning**:
1. There are 10 creatures in total, with each given a token numbered from 1 to 10.
2. The sum of the answers given by all creatures is 36.
3. Since elves tell the truth, their answers will match their token numbers.
4. Trolls lie, so their answers will be different from their token numbers.
5. If all creatures were elves, the sum of their answers would be 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 = 55.
6. The actual sum of answers is 36, which is 19 less than 55.
7. Each troll's lie reduces the sum by at least 1.
8. Since the sum is reduced by 19, there must be at least 19 instances where lies were told.
9. Since each troll lies only once, the smallest number of trolls needed to account for this reduction is 4 (as 4 trolls could lie by a total of 19).

**Answer**: C)
