**Reasoning**: To determine the final score, we start with the halftime score of 9:14, where the visiting team is leading by 5 goals. In the second half, the home team scored twice as many goals as the visiting team and won by one goal. Let x be the number of goals the visiting team scored in the second half. Then the home team scored 2x goals in the second half.

The total number of goals scored by the home team is:
9 (first half) + 2x (second half)

The total number of goals scored by the visiting team is:
14 (first half) + x (second half)

Since the home team won by one goal:
9 + 2x = 14 + x + 1
9 + 2x = 15 + x
2x - x = 15 - 9
x = 6

Now, we calculate the final scores:
Home team: 9 (first half) + 2 * 6 (second half) = 9 + 12 = 21
Visiting team: 14 (first half) + 6 (second half) = 14 + 6 = 20

The correct final score is 21:20.

**Answer**: B)
