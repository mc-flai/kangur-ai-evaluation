To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is \( V = \pi r^2 h \), where \( V \) is the volume, \( r \) is the radius, and \( h \) is the height.

Let's denote the radius of cylinder A as \( r \) and the radius of cylinder B as \( 1.1r \) (since it is 10% bigger).

Given that the volumes of the two cylinders are the same, we have:
\[ \pi r^2 h_A = \pi (1.1r)^2 h_B \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ r^2 h_A = (1.1r)^2 h_B \]
\[ r^2 h_A = 1.21r^2 h_B \]
\[ h_A = 1.21 h_B \]

This means the height of cylinder A is 1.21 times the height of cylinder B, which corresponds to a 21% increase.

Reasoning: The height of cylinder A is 1.21 times the height of cylinder B, which is a 21% increase.

Answer: E) 21 %.
