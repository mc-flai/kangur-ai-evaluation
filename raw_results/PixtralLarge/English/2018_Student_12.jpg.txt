To determine which vase the graph shown describes, we need to understand the relationship between the height of the water (h) and time (t). The graph indicates that as time increases, the height of the water increases at a decreasing rate, which means the rate of change of height is slowing down over time.

This type of behavior is typically seen in vases where the cross-sectional area increases as you move upwards, causing the water level to rise more slowly as the vase fills. This behavior is characteristic of a vase that is wider at the top than at the bottom.

Let's analyze the vases:
- (A) A cylindrical vase: The height would increase linearly with time since the cross-sectional area is constant.
- (B) A double-cone shaped vase: The height would increase non-linearly, but not necessarily in a continuously decreasing rate as shown in the graph.
- (C) A spherical vase: The height would increase non-linearly, but it would not match the curve shown in the graph.
- (D) A conical vase: The height would increase non-linearly, and the rate of increase would slow down as the vase fills, matching the graph.
- (E) A flask-shaped vase: The height would increase non-linearly, but it would not match the curve shown in the graph.

Reasoning: The graph shows a height increasing at a decreasing rate, which matches the behavior of a conical vase where the cross-sectional area increases as you move upwards.

Answer: D).
