**Reasoning**:
1. The motorboat takes 4 hours to go downstream from X to Y.
2. It takes 6 hours to travel back upstream from Y to X.
3. The difference in time (6 hours upstream vs. 4 hours downstream) indicates that the stream's current aids the boat's motion downstream and opposes it upstream.
4. The time taken by a tree trunk to float from X to Y would solely depend on the stream's current because tree trunks float naturally with the flow of the water.
5. Since the motorboat takes 4 hours to go downstream, it includes both its own speed and the stream's current speed.
6. Therefore, the time taken by the tree trunk, which moves only with the stream's current, is the average of the times taken by the motorboat moving downstream and upstream.
7. Calculating the average time: (4 hours downstream + 6 hours upstream) / 2 = 10 hours / 2 = 5 hours.
