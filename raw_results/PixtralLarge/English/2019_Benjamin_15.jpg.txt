**Reasoning**: 
1. Bridget starts with a square piece of paper.
2. She folds the paper once, which divides the paper into two equal parts.
3. She folds the paper again, which further divides each of the two parts into two, resulting in four equal parts.
4. She then cuts the paper along the two lines shown in the picture. Each cut splits one of the folds, creating separate pieces.
5. The paper is initially folded into four parts and then cut along each fold, resulting in four separate pieces of paper.

**Answer**: C)
