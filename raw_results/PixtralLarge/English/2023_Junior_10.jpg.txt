To determine the minimum number of games Beth has to play to increase her winning rate to 50%, we need to analyze the given data and set up an equation.

1. **Current Winning Rate**:
   - Beth's current winning rate is 49%.
   - This means she has won 49% of 200 games.
   - Number of games won = 0.49 * 200 = 98 games.

2. **Desired Winning Rate**:
   - To have a winning rate of 50%, Beth must win exactly half of the total games played.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of additional games she needs to play to achieve this.
   - The total number of games played will then be \( 200 + x \).
   - The total number of games won to achieve a 50% winning rate will be \( \frac{200 + x}{2} \).

3. **Equation Setup**:
   - The number of games won needs to be at least \( 98 \) (current wins) + 1 (to ensure more than 49%).
   - We set up the equation:
     \[
     98 + 1 = \frac{200 + x}{2}
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     99 = \frac{200 + x}{2}
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 2:
     \[
     198 = 200 + x
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 198 - 200 = -2
     \]
   - Since \( x \) cannot be negative, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( x \) that satisfies:
     \[
     99 = \frac{200 + x}{2}
     \]
   - Increment \( x \) until the equation holds true:
     \[
     99 = \frac{200 + 2}{2} \implies 99 = 101 \quad (\text{incorrect})
     \]
     \[
     99 = \frac{200 + 3}{2} \implies 99 = 101.5 \quad (\text{incorrect})
     \]
     \[
     99 = \frac{200 + 4}{2} \implies 99 = 102 \quad (\text{incorrect})
     \]
     \[
     100 = \frac{200 + 4}{2} \implies 100 = 102 \quad (\text{incorrect})
     \]
   - Thus, the smallest \( x \) that satisfies the equation is \( x = 2 \).

Reasoning: By following the steps and solving the equation, we find that Beth needs to play at least 2 more games to increase her winning rate to 50%.

Answer: B).
