**Reasoning**:
1. The total weight of the cake is 900 grams.
2. Paul cuts it into 4 pieces where the biggest piece weighs exactly as much as the other three pieces combined.
3. Let the weight of the biggest piece be \( x \) grams.
4. The combined weight of the other three pieces is \( x \) grams.
5. Therefore, the weight of the other three pieces together plus the weight of the biggest piece is equal to the total weight of the cake:
   \[
   x + x = 900 \text{ grams}
   \]
   \[
   2x = 900 \text{ grams}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{900}{2} = 450 \text{ grams}
   \]
6. Thus, the biggest piece weighs 450 grams.

**Answer**: D) 450 g
