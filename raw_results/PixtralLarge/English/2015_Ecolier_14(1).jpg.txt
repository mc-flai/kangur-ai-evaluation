Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. Peter starts at point S.
2. He rides from S and turns right at the first crossing, which would take him to point A.
3. He then turns left, which would take him to point D.
4. He then turns right, which would keep him moving to point A again.
5. Finally, he turns left, which means he would not reach point E.

So, the crossing he does not reach is:

Reasoning: Peter's path based on the directions given (right, left, right, left) means he does not reach point E.
Answer: E).
