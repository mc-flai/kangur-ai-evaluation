Let's analyze question 17 step by step:

1. The train conductor starts his journey at station B.
2. His first stop is at station C.

We need to determine the 46th stop. The train stops at every station and reverses direction after reaching either station A or station F. The sequence of stops starting from station B will be:
- B, C, D, E, F, E, D, C, B, A, B, C, D, E, F, E, D, C, B, A, B, C, D, E, F, ...

Notice that the sequence repeats every 10 stops: {B, C, D, E, F, E, D, C, B, A}. 

To find the 46th stop, we can use the modulus operation to identify which stop in the repeating sequence corresponds to the 46th stop:
- Calculate (46 - 1) % 10 because the first stop is already B.
- (45) % 10 = 5.

This means the 46th stop corresponds to the 5th position in the repeating sequence. The repeating sequence is: {B, C, D, E, F, E, D, C, B, A}.

The 5th position in this sequence is station F.

Reasoning: The 46th stop is calculated by considering the repeating sequence of stations and using the modulus operation to find the corresponding position in the sequence.

Answer: E).
