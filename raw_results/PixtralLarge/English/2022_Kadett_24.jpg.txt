To solve question 24, we need to determine what part of Marc's journey he covered by bike.

First, let's analyze the information given:
- By bike, it takes Marc 20 minutes to go from home to school and back.
- By foot, it takes him 60 minutes for the same distance.
- The total journey (home to school and back) took 52 minutes.

We need to find out the proportion of the journey Marc covered by bike.

Let's denote:
- The distance from home to Eva's house as \( d_1 \)
- The distance from Eva's house to school as \( d_2 \)

Since the speed is constant, the time taken to travel these distances by bike or foot will be proportional to the distances.

Let \( t_b \) be the time Marc spent biking, and \( t_f \) be the time he spent walking. Therefore, the total time for the journey is:
\[ t_b + t_f = 52 \text{ minutes} \]

We know:
- Biking the entire round trip takes 20 minutes.
- Walking the entire round trip takes 60 minutes.

Let \( x \) be the fraction of the journey covered by bike. Then:
- \( t_b = 20x \)
- \( t_f = 60(1-x) \)

Using the total time equation:
\[ 20x + 60(1-x) = 52 \]
\[ 20x + 60 - 60x = 52 \]
\[ -40x + 60 = 52 \]
\[ -40x = 52 - 60 \]
\[ -40x = -8 \]
\[ x = \frac{-8}{-40} \]
\[ x = \frac{1}{5} \]

So, Marc covered \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the journey by bike.

Reasoning: Using the given times and setting up the equations, we find that Marc covered \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the journey by bike.
