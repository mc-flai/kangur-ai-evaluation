**Reasoning**: The calculation given in the question is:

\[
\frac{1}{9} \cdot 10^{2018} \cdot (10^{2018} - 1)
\]

First, let's break down the expression:

1. \(10^{2018} - 1\) will result in a number with 2018 digits, all of which are nine (i.e., 999...9).
2. Multiplying by \(10^{2018}\) shifts the decimal point 2018 places to the right, resulting in a number with 2018 nines followed by 2018 zeros.
3. Finally, multiplying by \(\frac{1}{9}\) essentially divides the entire number by 9. Given that \(10^{2018} - 1\) is essentially a string of 2018 nines, dividing this by 9 results in a number with 2018 ones.

Therefore, the final result of the calculation will be a number with 2018 digits, all of which are one.

**Answer**: B)
