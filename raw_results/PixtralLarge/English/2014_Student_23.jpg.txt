**Reasoning**: The problem states that there are 9 kangaroos and provides the probability that none of the three randomly chosen kangaroos are white as two-thirds (2/3). Let's denote the number of black kangaroos as \( b \).

If we select 3 kangaroos out of 9, the probability that none are white is equivalent to the probability that all 3 are black. The number of ways to choose 3 black kangaroos from \( b \) black kangaroos is \( \binom{b}{3} \). The total number of ways to choose 3 kangaroos from the 9 is \( \binom{9}{3} \).

The probability that all 3 chosen kangaroos are black is given by:
\[
\frac{\binom{b}{3}}{\binom{9}{3}} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

We know:
\[
\binom{9}{3} = \frac{9!}{3!(9-3)!} = 84
\]

So, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{\binom{b}{3}}{84} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

\[
\binom{b}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \times 84 = 56
\]

We also know:
\[
\binom{b}{3} = \frac{b!}{3!(b-3)!} = \frac{b(b-1)(b-2)}{6}
\]

Setting this equal to 56:
\[
\frac{b(b-1)(b-2)}{6} = 56
\]

Multiplying both sides by 6:
\[
b(b-1)(b-2) = 336
\]

By trial and error or solving the cubic equation, we find that \( b = 8 \) satisfies this equation, as:
\[
8 \times 7 \times 6 = 336
\]

Thus, there are 8 black kangaroos.
