**Reasoning**:
The question asks which of the given words have a vertical axis of symmetry when the letters are written underneath each other, similar to the word MAMA. A word has a vertical axis of symmetry if it reads the same when mirrored across a vertical line down the middle.

- **ADAM**: When written underneath each other, ADAM mirrors across a vertical line down the middle, hence it has a vertical axis of symmetry.
- **BAUM**: When written underneath each other, BAUM does not mirror across a vertical line down the middle, hence it does not have a vertical axis of symmetry.
- **BOOT**: When written underneath each other, BOOT mirrors across a vertical line down the middle, hence it has a vertical axis of symmetry.
- **LOGO**: When written underneath each other, LOGO does not mirror across a vertical line down the middle, hence it does not have a vertical axis of symmetry.
- **TOTO**: When written underneath each other, TOTO mirrors across a vertical line down the middle, hence it has a vertical axis of symmetry.

**Answer**: A) ADAM.
