To determine which line segment of the diagonal is the longest, we need to analyze the given areas of the triangles and the properties of the square.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The square has an area of 30. Since the area of a square is given by the formula \( \text{Area} = \text{side}^2 \), we can find the side length of the square:
   \[
   \text{side} = \sqrt{30}
   \]

2. **Diagonal Length**:
   The diagonal of a square with side length \( s \) is given by \( s\sqrt{2} \). Therefore, the diagonal length is:
   \[
   \text{diagonal} = \sqrt{30} \times \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{60}
   \]

3. **Analyzing the Triangles**:
   The square is split into two by its diagonal and then further split into triangles. The areas of some triangles are given in the diagram.

4. **Comparing Line Segments**:
   - Line segment \( a \) is part of the triangle with area 5 cm².
   - Line segment \( b \) is part of the triangle with area 9 cm².
   - Line segment \( c \) is part of the triangle with area 4 cm².
   - Line segment \( d \) is the diagonal of the square.
   - Line segment \( e \) is part of the triangle with area 4 cm².

   Since the diagonal of the square is the longest line segment in a square, segment \( d \) must be the longest.

Reasoning: The diagonal of the square is the longest line segment in the square, and segment \( d \) represents the diagonal.

Answer: D)
