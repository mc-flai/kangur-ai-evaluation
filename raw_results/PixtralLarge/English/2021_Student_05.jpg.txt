To determine in which direction the flagpole could be leaning over, we need to analyze the information provided:

1. From the northwest, the flagpole's tip is to the right of its bottom point.
2. From the east, the flagpole's tip is also to the right of its bottom point.

Given these observations, we need to deduce the direction the flagpole is leaning.

- If the tip is to the right of the bottom when viewed from the northwest, the flagpole is leaning toward the northeast.
- If the tip is to the right of the bottom when viewed from the east, the flagpole is leaning toward the south.

The only direction that satisfies both conditions is southeast.

Reasoning: The flagpole must be leaning southeast to be right of its bottom point when viewed from both the northwest and the east.

Answer: E).
