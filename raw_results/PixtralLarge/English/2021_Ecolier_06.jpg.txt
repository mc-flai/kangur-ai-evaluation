To analyze question 6, we need to determine which number should be at the place shown by the question mark on the measuring tape wrapped around a cylinder.

The numbers on the measuring tape increase sequentially. The visible numbers are 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31. The next number after 31 would be 32. Since the question mark is located after 31, it is reasonable to conclude that the number should be 32.

However, the options provided are:
(A) 33
(B) 42
(C) 48
(D) 53
(E) 69

Given the sequence of numbers on the tape, none of the options directly follow 31. The closest logical number after 31 is 32, but since 32 is not an option, we must consider the closest available option. The number 33 would logically follow 32 in a sequence if we were to consider the next number after 32.

Reasoning: The number on the measuring tape increases sequentially. The number that comes after 31 is 32, but since 32 is not an option, the closest number provided in the options is 33.

Answer: A)
