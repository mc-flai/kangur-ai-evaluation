To analyze question 9, we need to determine how many distinct paths the mouse can take to move from its starting position to the piece of cheese. The mouse is allowed to move only to the neighboring fields in the direction of the arrows.

1. **Identify the Starting and Ending Positions**:
   - The mouse starts in the top-left cell.
   - The cheese is in the bottom-right cell.

2. **Determine the Possible Moves**:
   - The mouse can move right or down according to the arrows.
   - To reach the cheese, the mouse must move 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down.

3. **Count the Paths**:
   - We need to find the number of distinct sequences of 2 right moves (R) and 2 down moves (D).
   - This can be calculated using combinations: the number of ways to choose 2 moves out of 4 is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{4}{2} \).

   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - There are 6 distinct paths from the mouse to the cheese.

Reasoning: The mouse must make 2 right moves and 2 down moves to reach the cheese. The number of distinct sequences of these moves is calculated using combinations, resulting in 6 paths.

Answer: E).
