The image shows a question asking how many deciliters of apple juice a medium bottle contains. The total volume on each shelf is 64 deciliters. The options provided are:

(A) 3
(B) 6
(C) 8
(D) 10
(E) 14

From the image, it is clear that there are 8 bottles in total on each shelf. These bottles comprise 3 large bottles, 3 medium bottles, and 2 small bottles. This can be observed from the illustration on the right side of the question.

To find out how many deciliters of apple juice a medium bottle contains, we first note that the total volume for all bottles is 64 deciliters. There are 3 medium bottles on each shelf. So, the volume of a medium bottle can be found by dividing the total volume by the number of medium bottles:

    64 deciliters / 3 medium bottles = 21.33 deciliters per medium bottle.

However, since the problem asks us to select from the given options, we can infer that the correct answer must be the closest value in the options provided. The closest value to 21.33 deciliters from the given options is 8 deciliters.

    Reasoning: The shelf holds a total of 64 deciliters, with 3 medium bottles. Dividing the total volume by the number of medium bottles gives approximately 21.33 deciliters, but the closest option provided is 8 deciliters.
    Answer: C).
