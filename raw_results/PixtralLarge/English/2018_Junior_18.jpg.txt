**Reasoning**:

To determine how often the summand \(2018^2\) appears under the root in the expression \(\sqrt{2018^2 + 2018^2 + \cdots + 2018^2} = 2018^{10}\), we need to understand the process of summing squares and taking the square root.

The given equation states that the sum of several instances of \(2018^2\) under the square root equals \(2018^{10}\). To find the number of summands \(2018^2\) that produce \(2018^{10}\) when summed and then the square root taken, we set up the following equation:

\[
\sqrt{k \cdot 2018^2} = 2018^{10}
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root, we get:

\[
k \cdot 2018^2 = 2018^{20}
\]

Dividing both sides by \(2018^2\), we obtain:

\[
k = 2018^{18}
\]

Thus, the summand \(2018^2\) appears \(2018^{18}\) times.
