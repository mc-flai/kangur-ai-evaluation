**Reasoning**:
The figure consists of one square part and eight rectangular parts, each 8 cm wide. To find the length of the rectangle formed by assembling all parts, we need to calculate the total length of the parts placed side by side.

1. The square part is 8 cm wide and 8 cm long (since it's a square).
2. Each of the eight rectangular parts is also 8 cm wide, but we need to determine their combined length.
3. The square part contributes 8 cm to the total length.
4. Each rectangular part is 8 cm wide, and its length is not given, but if we assume they are identical and fit perfectly to form a single long rectangle of 8 cm width, their combined length will be the total length of the final rectangle minus the 8 cm of the square.

Since the width is already given as 8 cm, we need to calculate the combined length of the rectangle. The image shows that the square and rectangular parts are arranged in a way that nine 8 cm parts are aligned horizontally.

5. The total length can be calculated as follows:
   - The square part contributes 8 cm.
   - Each of the eight rectangular parts contributes 8 cm to the length.

Total length = 8 cm (square) + 8 * 8 cm (rectangles) = 8 cm + 64 cm = 72 cm.

However, looking at the options, none of them directly match 72 cm. The closest possible length that fits the options provided and aligns with the arrangement seen in the image is 168 cm, which suggests that each part length might have been misinterpreted.

Given that each part is 8 cm wide and there are 9 parts in total, the length should be:
Total length = 8 cm * 9 = 72 cm.

However, the provided options suggest a different interpretation or arrangement, leading to the most plausible answer being 168 cm if each part is considered to contribute more to the length than just 8 cm.

**Answer**: B).
