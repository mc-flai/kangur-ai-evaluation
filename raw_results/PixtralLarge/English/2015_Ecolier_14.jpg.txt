**Reasoning**: To determine which crossing Peter does not reach, let's trace his path step-by-step according to the directions given.

1. Peter starts at point S and rides in the direction of the arrow.
2. At the first crossing, he turns right. This means he takes the right path at crossing D.
3. Then, at the next crossing, he turns left. This means he takes the left path at crossing A.
4. He then turns to the right again. Since he is already on the left path at crossing A, turning right leads him back to crossing D.
5. Finally, he turns left again, which means he goes back to crossing A and takes the left path.

So, the crossings Peter reaches are D and A. The crossings he does not reach are B, C, and E. Therefore, the correct answer must be one of these.

Based on the path described, Peter never reaches crossing C.

**Answer**: C).
