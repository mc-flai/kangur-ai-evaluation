**Reasoning**: To solve this problem, we need to understand how the smaller acute angles of the triangles can touch to form a star. In the first star, each point of the star is formed by the larger acute angles of 5 triangles coming together. To form a second star where the smaller acute angles touch, the same arrangement needs to happen, but with the smaller angles.

Since each triangle has one larger acute angle and one smaller acute angle, and there are 5 triangles in the first star, forming a similar star with the smaller acute angles would require another set of 5 triangles. Therefore, to form the second star, we need an additional 5 triangles.

This means a total of 5 (from the first star) + 5 (for the second star) = 10 triangles are needed.

**Answer**: A)
