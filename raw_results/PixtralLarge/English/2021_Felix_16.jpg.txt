The problem states:
- The kangaroo had two branches, each with 10 leaves.
- The kangaroo ate some leaves from one branch, leaving it with a certain number of leaves.
- Then the kangaroo ate the same number of leaves from the second branch that were left on the first branch.

Let's denote:
- The number of leaves left on the first branch after the kangaroo ate some as x.
- Therefore, the kangaroo ate (10 - x) leaves from the first branch.
- The kangaroo then ate x leaves from the second branch.

Total leaves left:
- First branch: x leaves
- Second branch: 10 - x leaves

Total leaves left on both branches combined:
x + (10 - x) = 10

Reasoning: The total number of leaves left on the two branches is 10, regardless of how many leaves the kangaroo ate from the first branch.

Answer: D)
