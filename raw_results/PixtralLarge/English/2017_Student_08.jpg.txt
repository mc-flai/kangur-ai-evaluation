**Reasoning**: The linear function \( f(x) = -3.5x + 7 \) has a negative slope \(-3.5\), which means the line will decrease as \( x \) increases. To determine which quadrant contains no points of the graph, we need to consider the behavior of the function.

1. When \( x = 0 \), \( f(0) = 7 \), which is a positive y-intercept. Therefore, the graph intersects the y-axis in the first quadrant (I).
2. Since the slope is negative, the line will slope downwards as it moves to the right.
3. For negative values of \( x \), the values of \( f(x) \) will be positive, meaning the graph passes through the second quadrant (II).
4. For positive values of \( x \), the values of \( f(x) \) will be negative, meaning the graph passes through the fourth quadrant (IV).

Given this analysis, the line does not pass through the third quadrant (III) because in that quadrant both \( x \) and \( y \) are negative, and the function \( f(x) = -3.5x + 7 \) cannot have both x and y negative simultaneously.

**Answer**: C).
