To determine which cake belongs to Sophie, we need to analyze the given information:

1. Lea is two years older than Josef.
2. Lea is one year younger than Ali.
3. Vittorio is the youngest.

First, let's denote the ages of the children with variables:
- Let Ali's age be \( a \).
- Lea's age is \( a - 1 \).
- Josef's age is \( (a - 1) - 2 = a - 3 \).

Since Vittorio is the youngest, his age must be less than Josef's age, which is less than \( a - 3 \).

The cakes show the ages 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4. Since Vittorio is the youngest and must be younger than Josef, Vittorio cannot be 7, 6, 5, or 4 because Josef is \( a - 3 \). Therefore, Vittorio must be 4 years old.

Now we know:
- Vittorio is 4 years old.
- Josef is \( a - 3 \).

Since Vittorio is 4 years old, Josef must be older than 4, so Josef must be 5 or 6. But since Vittorio is the youngest, Josef must be 5 years old.

Now we have:
- Vittorio is 4 years old.
- Josef is 5 years old.

Following the age relationships:
- Lea is \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) years old.
- Ali is \( 7 + 1 = 8 \) years old.

Since the ages 4, 5, 7, and 8 are already assigned to Vittorio, Josef, Lea, and Ali respectively, the only remaining age is 6. Therefore, Sophie must be 6 years old.

Reasoning: By analyzing the relationships between the ages and the given conditions, we determined that Sophie is 6 years old.
Answer: C).
