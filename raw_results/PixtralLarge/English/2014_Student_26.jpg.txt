**Reasoning**:

1. **Understanding the problem**: We have two regular polygons sharing a common edge AB. One is a 15-sided polygon (pentadecagon), and the other is an n-sided polygon. We need to find the value of n such that the distance between points \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) is exactly 1.

2. **Analyzing the geometry**: Since both polygons are regular and each side length is 1, the interior angles of these polygons are crucial. The interior angle of a regular n-sided polygon is given by:
   \[
   \text{Interior angle} = \frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n}
   \]

3. **Calculating the interior angle of the 15-sided polygon**:
   \[
   \text{Interior angle of a 15-sided polygon} = \frac{(15-2) \times 180^\circ}{15} = \frac{13 \times 180^\circ}{15} = 156^\circ
   \]

4. **Finding n using the distance condition**: The distance between \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) is exactly 1, meaning the vertices \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) must be one unit apart. Since the side length of the polygons is 1, the distance between adjacent vertices that are directly opposite each other across a common edge (AB) fits this condition.

5. **Considering symmetry and geometry**: The polygons are symmetric, and the distance condition implies that \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) should be vertices that align in a way that fits the side length of 1. This typically happens when n is an even number that allows for such symmetric alignment.

6. **Checking the options**:
   - A) 10: The interior angle of a 10-sided polygon (decagon) is:
     \[
     \text{Interior angle} = \frac{(10-2) \times 180^\circ}{10} = 144^\circ
     \]
     This does not perfectly align with the 156° of the 15-sided polygon.
   - B) 12: The interior angle of a 12-sided polygon (dodecagon) is:
     \[
     \text{Interior angle} = \frac{(12-2) \times 180^\circ}{12} = 150^\circ
     \]
     This is closer but still not equal.
   - C) 15: This matches the 15-sided polygon and does not provide a new n.
   - D) 16: The interior angle of a 16-sided polygon is:
     \[
     \text{Interior angle} = \frac{(16-2) \times 180^\circ}{16} = 157.5^\circ
     \]
     This is very close to 156° and fits the requirement.
   - E) 18: The interior angle of an 18-sided polygon is:
     \[
     \text{Interior angle} = \frac{(18-2) \times 180^\circ}{18} = 160^\circ
     \]
     This does not fit.

7. **Conclusion**: The only even number n that fits the geometric alignment and distance condition is 16.
