The problem states that each pair of people who know each other shake hands exactly once. Given this, we know the following:

- Anna shakes hands once.
- Bella shakes hands twice.
- Claire shakes hands three times.
- Dora shakes hands four times.

To determine how many people Erika shakes hands with, we need to look at the total number of handshakes and who shook hands with whom.

Given that each person shakes hands with everyone else exactly once and knowing the number of handshakes each person participated in, we can deduce the following:

- Anna has only one handshake, which must be with someone who has more handshakes.
- Bella has two handshakes. One of these must be with Anna and the other with someone else.
- Claire has three handshakes. One with Anna, one with Bella, and one with someone else.
- Dora has four handshakes. One with Anna, one with Bella, one with Claire, and one with someone else.

Since Erika is the only person left, she must have shaken hands with Anna, Bella, Claire, and Dora. This means Erika also has four handshakes.

**Reasoning**: Erika must have shaken hands with each of the four other attendees at the party since each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once.

**Answer**: D)
