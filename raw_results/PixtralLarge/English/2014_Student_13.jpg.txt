**Reasoning**:
1. Identify the given information:
   - The ratio of the radii of the two concentric circles is 1:3.
   - Line AC is a diameter of the bigger circle.
   - Chord BC of the big circle touches the small circle.
   - Line AB has a length of 12.

2. Let the radius of the small circle be r. Then, the radius of the big circle is 3r (since the ratio is 1:3).

3. Since line AC is the diameter of the big circle, AC = 2 * 3r = 6r.

4. In the right triangle ABC (with AB = 12 and BC touching the smaller circle), BC is a tangent to the smaller circle at point B.

5. The length of BC can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABC:
   - Given AB = 12 and AC = 6r.
   - We know AC = AB + BC, so BC = AC - AB = 6r - 12.
   - Since AB is tangent to the smaller circle at B, AB is equal to the radius of the smaller circle (r).
   - Therefore, r = 12.

6. Using the ratio 1:3, the radius of the big circle is 3r = 3 * 12 = 36.

7. The diameter of the big circle is twice the radius, so the diameter is 2 * 36 = 72.

8. However, the question asks for the radius of the big circle, which is 36.

**Answer**: E) 26.
