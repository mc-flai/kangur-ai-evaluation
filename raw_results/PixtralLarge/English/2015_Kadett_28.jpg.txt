**Reasoning**:
Erichâ€™s phone number has 7 digits. I have noted down 6 of these digits in the correct order. This means I have one digit missing, and I do not know which digit it is or its position.

To find the correct phone number, I have to try placing each of the 10 possible digits (0-9) into each of the 7 possible positions in the phone number. This gives us:

10 (possible missing digits) * 7 (possible positions) = 70 tries.

Therefore, the maximum number of tries I have to make to ensure I have used the correct phone number is 70.

**Answer**: D)
