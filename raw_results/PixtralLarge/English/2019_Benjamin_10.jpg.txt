To answer question 10, we need to determine which sum Toni will not be able to make by rolling a die with the six smallest odd natural numbers and adding the numbers three times. The six smallest odd natural numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11.

Since Toni rolls the die three times, we need to consider the range of possible sums:
- The minimum sum occurs when the lowest number (1) is rolled three times: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
- The maximum sum occurs when the highest number (11) is rolled three times: 11 + 11 + 11 = 33.

Thus, the possible sums range from 3 to 33. Now, we evaluate which of these sums cannot be made:
- 3: Possible (1 + 1 + 1)
- 19: Possible (1 + 9 + 9)
- 21: Possible (1 + 11 + 9 or 3 + 9 + 9)
- 29: Possible (7 + 11 + 11)
- 35: Not possible since the maximum sum is 33.

Therefore, the sum that Toni will not be able to make is 35.

Reasoning: The sums range from 3 to 33, and since 35 is greater than 33, it cannot be made by rolling the die three times.
