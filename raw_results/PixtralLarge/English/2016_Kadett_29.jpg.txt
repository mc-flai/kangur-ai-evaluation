**Reasoning**:

1. The problem states that there are five carriages on the train, and each carriage has at least one passenger.
2. Each passenger has either exactly 5 or exactly 10 neighbors.
3. To determine the number of passengers, let's analyze different scenarios for the number of neighbors:

   - If a passenger has exactly 5 neighbors, this means the passenger is surrounded by passengers in the same carriage or in adjacent carriages.
   - If a passenger has exactly 10 neighbors, this means they are surrounded by passengers in both the same carriage and in the two adjacent carriages.

4. To ensure that every passenger has either 5 or 10 neighbors, consider the following:

   - If there were fewer than 15 passengers, it would be impossible for all passengers to have either 5 or 10 neighbors.
   - With 15 passengers, it is possible to arrange them such that each passenger has either 5 or 10 neighbors by distributing them across the carriages.
   - If there were more than 15 passengers, the configuration would exceed the required number of neighbors.

5. Therefore, the minimum number of passengers required to satisfy these conditions must be 15.
