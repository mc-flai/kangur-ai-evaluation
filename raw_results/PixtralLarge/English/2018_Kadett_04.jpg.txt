To solve for the star (★) in the equation 2 * 18 * 14 = 6 * ★ * 7, we need to ensure both sides of the equation are equal.

First, let's calculate the left side of the equation:
2 * 18 * 14 = (2 * 18) * 14
            = 36 * 14
            = 504

Now, we know that the right side of the equation should also equal 504:
6 * ★ * 7 = 504

Let's solve for ★:
(6 * ★ * 7) = 504
(42 * ★) = 504
★ = 504 / 42
★ = 12

So, the correct number to replace the star (★) is 12.

Reasoning: Calculated the left side of the equation, set it equal to the right side, then solved for ★ by dividing 504 by 42.
Answer: D).
