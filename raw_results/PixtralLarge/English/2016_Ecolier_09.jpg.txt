To determine the next year after 2016 for which the sum of the digits is 9, we need to analyze each given option.

- **Option A: 2007**
  - Sum of digits: 2 + 0 + 0 + 7 = 9
  - This is correct, but we need to find the next year after 2016.

- **Option B: 2025**
  - Sum of digits: 2 + 0 + 2 + 5 = 9
  - This is correct and it is after 2016.

- **Option C: 2034**
  - Sum of digits: 2 + 0 + 3 + 4 = 9
  - This is correct and it is after 2016.

- **Option D: 2108**
  - Sum of digits: 2 + 1 + 0 + 8 = 11
  - This is incorrect.

- **Option E: 2134**
  - Sum of digits: 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 10
  - This is incorrect.

Reasoning: The next year after 2016 where the sum of the digits is 9 is 2025, as 2034 is also correct but comes after 2025.
