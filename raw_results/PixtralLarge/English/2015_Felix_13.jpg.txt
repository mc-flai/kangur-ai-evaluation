**Reasoning**: To determine the missing piece in the pattern, observe the arrangement of the stars and arrows in the triangular segments of the main puzzle. The triangles have a consistent pattern where each triangle contains a specific configuration of stars and arrows. By examining the triangles surrounding the missing piece, you can identify which configuration fits correctly.

- The triangle above and the triangles to the right and left of the missing piece give clues about the correct configuration.
- Option B) has two stars on the top half and two arrows on the bottom half.
- Option D) has a similar configuration but is oriented differently compared to option B).
- Other options (A, C, and E) have different patterns that do not match the surrounding triangles.

Given the surrounding triangles, option B) matches the pattern correctly.

**Answer**: B).
