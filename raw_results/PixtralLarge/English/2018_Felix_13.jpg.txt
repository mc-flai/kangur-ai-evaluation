**Reasoning**: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial pieces of paper**:
   - White pieces: 3
   - Black pieces: 2
   - Grey pieces: 2

2. **First action** (cutting every piece that is not black into two pieces):
   - White pieces cut into two: 3 * 2 = 6 pieces
   - Grey pieces cut into two: 2 * 2 = 4 pieces
   - Total pieces after first action: 6 (white) + 2 (black) + 4 (grey) = 12 pieces

3. **Second action** (halving every piece of paper that is not white):
   - Black pieces halved: 2 * 2 = 4 pieces
   - Grey pieces halved: 4 * 2 = 8 pieces
   - Total pieces after second action: 6 (white) + 4 (black) + 8 (grey) = 18 pieces

By carefully following the steps and calculations, we obtain a total of 18 pieces.
