**Reasoning**:
1. The problem states that each face of the polyhedron is either a triangle or a square.
2. Each square borders 4 triangles, and each triangle borders 3 squares.
3. The polyhedron has 6 squares.
4. To find the number of triangles, we start by calculating the total number of triangle borders. Each square contributes 4 triangle borders, so for 6 squares:
   Total triangle borders = 6 squares * 4 borders/square = 24 triangle borders.
5. Since each triangle borders 3 squares, each triangle border is counted 3 times in the total. Therefore, to find the actual number of triangles, we divide the total triangle borders by 3:
   Number of triangles = 24 triangle borders / 3 borders/triangle = 8 triangles.

**Answer**: D)
