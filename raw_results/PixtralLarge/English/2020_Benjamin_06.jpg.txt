**Reasoning**: Bia has five coins as shown and she uses only three coins to buy the fruit without receiving change. We need to check each option to see which one she cannot buy with three of her coins.

1. Option (A) 1.30:
   - Bia's coins are: 2, 1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05.
   - Possible combinations: 1 + 0.5 + 0.1 = 1.60 (not possible), 1 + 0.5 + 0.05 = 1.55 (not possible), 1 + 0.1 + 0.05 = 1.15 (not possible), 0.5 + 0.1 + 0.05 + other coins combination doesn't work.
   - Bia cannot use three coins to make 1.30 without change.

2. Option (B) 1.35:
   - Possible combinations: 1 + 0.5 + 0.1 = 1.60 (not possible), 1 + 0.5 + 0.05 = 1.55 (not possible), 1 + 0.1 + 0.05 = 1.15 (not possible), 0.5 + 0.1 + 0.05 + other coins combination doesn't work.
   - Bia cannot use three coins to make 1.35 without change.

3. Option (C) 1.40:
   - Possible combinations: 1 + 0.5 + 0.1 = 1.60 (not possible), 1 + 0.5 + 0.05 = 1.55 (not possible), 1 + 0.1 + 0.05 = 1.15 (not possible), 0.5 + 0.1 + 0.05 + other coins combination doesn't work.
   - Bia cannot use three coins to make 1.40 without change.

4. Option (D) 1.55:
   - Possible combinations: 1 + 0.5 + 0.05 = 1.55.
   - Bia can use 1 Euro, 50 cents, and 5 cents coins to make 1.55 without change.

5. Option (E) 1.75:
   - Possible combinations: 1 + 0.5 + 0.1 = 1.60 (not possible), 1 + 0.5 + 0.05 = 1.55 (not possible), 1 + 0.1 + 0.05 = 1.15 (not possible), 0.5 + 0.1 + 0.05 + other coins combination doesn't work.
   - Bia cannot use three coins to make 1.75 without change.

Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer**: A).
