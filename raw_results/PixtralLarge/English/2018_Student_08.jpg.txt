To solve question 8, we need to determine the minimum number of draws required to ensure that at least one white ball is drawn from a box containing 65 balls, with 8 of them being white.

**Reasoning**:
1. We have a total of 65 balls, with 8 white balls and 57 black balls.
2. We need to ensure that at least one white ball is drawn.
3. To guarantee drawing at least one white ball, consider the worst-case scenario where we draw all the black balls first.
4. There are 57 black balls, so the worst case is drawing all 57 black balls first.
5. The next draw is guaranteed to be a white ball.
6. Therefore, to ensure at least one white ball is drawn, we need 57 draws (all black balls) + 1 draw (one white ball) = 58 draws.

**Answer**: E).
