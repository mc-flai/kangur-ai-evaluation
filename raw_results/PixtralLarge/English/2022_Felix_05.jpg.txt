**Reasoning**:
1. First, let's examine the main map that the monkey has torn a piece off from. Notice the shape and features of the main map.
2. The main map shows an area with a distinct coastline, several symbols, and a large section marked with "A A A."
3. Now, let's look at the options provided (A, B, C, D, E). We need to determine which piece would fit seamlessly into the torn section of the main map.
4. Option (A) and (C) have similar coastlines but different symbols and layout compared to the main map.
5. Option (B) has a red 'X' mark that does not appear in the main map.
6. Option (E) does not match well with the coastline and symbols of the main map.
7. Option (D) has both a matching coastline and symbols, including the "A A A" markings, and it fits perfectly in terms of shape and features.

**Answer**: D).
