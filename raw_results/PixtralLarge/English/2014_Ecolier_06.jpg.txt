**Reasoning**: 

1. Anita has built fewer sandcastles than Hans but more than Steffan. 
2. Fabian has built more sandcastles than Anita and more than Hans. 
3. Bruno has built more sandcastles than Hans but less than Fabian.

From these statements, we can infer the following:
- Fabian has built more sandcastles than both Anita and Hans.
- Bruno has built more sandcastles than Hans but is outnumbered by Fabian.
- Since Anita has built fewer sandcastles than Hans, she cannot have built the most.
- Steffan has built fewer sandcastles than Anita, placing him lower on the list.
- Thus, Fabian is the one who has built the most sandcastles.
