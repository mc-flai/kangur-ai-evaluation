To determine how many quadratic functions \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) (with \( a \neq 0 \)) have graphs that go through at least 3 of the marked points, we need to consider the properties of quadratic functions and the constraints provided by the marked points.

1. **Properties of Quadratic Functions**:
   - A quadratic function \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) has a parabolic shape.
   - It can have at most 2 x-intercepts (roots).
   - It can pass through at most 3 points if those points are collinear or lie on a single parabola.

2. **Analyzing the Marked Points**:
   - The marked points are vertically aligned in the given image.
   - Vertically aligned points imply that they have the same x-coordinate but different y-coordinates.
   - A quadratic function cannot pass through more than two points with the same x-coordinate because it would violate the definition of a function (each x-coordinate maps to exactly one y-coordinate).

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the marked points are vertically aligned, no single quadratic function can pass through three or more of these points without violating the properties of a function.
   - Therefore, the number of quadratic functions that pass through at least 3 of these points is zero.

Reasoning: The marked points are vertically aligned, meaning they have the same x-coordinate. A quadratic function cannot pass through more than two points with the same x-coordinate, so no quadratic function can pass through at least 3 of these points.

Answer: A).
