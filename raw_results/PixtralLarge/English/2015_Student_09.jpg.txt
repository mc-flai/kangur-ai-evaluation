To determine the correct expression that relates the areas of the semi-circles forming the sides of a right-angled triangle, we need to consider the relationship between the areas of the semi-circles on each side of the triangle.

1. The area of a semi-circle is given by \(\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius. Since the diameter of each semi-circle is equal to the side of the triangle, we can write the areas in terms of the sides \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) (where \(Z\) is the hypotenuse).

2. The area of the semi-circle with diameter \(X\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \pi \left(\frac{X}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi X^2}{8}\).

3. The area of the semi-circle with diameter \(Y\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \pi \left(\frac{Y}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi Y^2}{8}\).

4. The area of the semi-circle with diameter \(Z\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \pi \left(\frac{Z}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi Z^2}{8}\).

5. According to the Pythagorean theorem, for a right-angled triangle, the sum of the squares of the two smaller sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse: \(X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2\).

6. Therefore, the sum of the areas of the semi-circles on the two smaller sides should be equal to the area of the semi-circle on the hypotenuse.

7. This relationship can be expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{\pi X^2}{8} + \frac{\pi Y^2}{8} = \frac{\pi Z^2}{8}
   \]

8. Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2
   \]

Thus, the correct expression that relates the areas of the semi-circles is \(X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2\).

Reasoning: The relationship between the areas of the semi-circles on the sides of a right-angled triangle is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the sum of the squares of the two smaller sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse.
