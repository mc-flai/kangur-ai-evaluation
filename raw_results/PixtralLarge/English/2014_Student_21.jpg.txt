To determine which statement is definitely true given that the numbers \((-2)^{2n+3} \times a^{2n+2} \times b^{2n-1} \times c^{2n+2}\) and \((-3)^{2n+2} \times a^{4n+1} \times b^{2n+5} \times c^{3n-4}\) have the same sign, we need to analyze the expressions.

First, let's simplify the expressions by examining the sign of each term:

1. \((-2)^{2n+3}\): Since \(2n+3\) is always odd (because \(n\) is a positive whole number), \((-2)^{2n+3}\) is always negative.
2. \(a^{2n+2}\): Since \(2n+2\) is always even, \(a^{2n+2}\) is always positive (because \(a\) is a real number and any real number raised to an even power is positive).
3. \(b^{2n-1}\): Since \(2n-1\) is always odd, \(b^{2n-1}\) has the same sign as \(b\).
4. \(c^{2n+2}\): Since \(2n+2\) is always even, \(c^{2n+2}\) is always positive (because \(c\) is a real number and any real number raised to an even power is positive).

So, the sign of \((-2)^{2n+3} \times a^{2n+2} \times b^{2n-1} \times c^{2n+2}\) is determined by the sign of \(b\).

Next, let's analyze the second expression:

1. \((-3)^{2n+2}\): Since \(2n+2\) is always even, \((-3)^{2n+2}\) is always positive.
2. \(a^{4n+1}\): Since \(4n+1\) is always odd, \(a^{4n+1}\) has the same sign as \(a\).
3. \(b^{2n+5}\): Since \(2n+5\) is always odd, \(b^{2n+5}\) has the same sign as \(b\).
4. \(c^{3n-4}\): Since \(3n-4\) is always odd, \(c^{3n-4}\) has the same sign as \(c\).

So, the sign of \((-3)^{2n+2} \times a^{4n+1} \times b^{2n+5} \times c^{3n-4}\) is determined by the sign of \(a \times b \times c\).

For the two expressions to have the same sign, the product \(a \times b \times c\) must be negative (since the first expression is negative and the second expression is positive).

Therefore, \(b\) must be negative for the two expressions to have the same sign.

Reasoning: The sign of the first expression is determined by \(b\), and for the two expressions to have the same sign, \(b\) must be negative.
