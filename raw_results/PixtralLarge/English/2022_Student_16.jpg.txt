To determine the minimum number of power plants required, we need to consider the problem as a graph theory problem where each town is a vertex and each road is an edge. The goal is to ensure that each town and its immediate neighbors have access to a power plant.

1. **Identify the structure**: The diagram shows a grid of 16 towns connected by roads. We need to ensure that every town and its directly connected neighbors can receive electricity.

2. **Optimal placement**: We need to place the power plants in such a way that they cover the maximum number of towns with the minimum number of power plants.

3. **Strategic placement**:
    - If we place a power plant in every other town in a checkerboard pattern, it ensures that each town and its neighbors are covered.
    - In a 4x4 grid (16 towns), placing a power plant in every other town would mean placing 8 power plants. However, this is not the minimum.

4. **Minimum number of power plants**:
    - By strategically placing the power plants, we can reduce the number. For example, placing power plants at (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), and (4,4) ensures coverage of all towns.
    - This placement covers all towns with only 6 power plants.

Reasoning: By strategically placing the power plants in a way that covers all towns and their neighbors, we can minimize the number of power plants required to 6.
