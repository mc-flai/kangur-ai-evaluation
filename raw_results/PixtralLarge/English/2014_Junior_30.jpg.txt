**Reasoning**:
1. **Identify Midpoints and Segments**: In triangle ABC, M is the midpoint of BC, so BM = MC = 5 cm (half of 10 cm).

2. **Calculate Segment Lengths**: Since M is the midpoint of BC, and AMDE is a square, the side length of the square AMDE is equal to BM, which is 5 cm.

3. **Calculate the Area of Square AMDE**: The area of square AMDE is given by (side length)^2 = 5 cm * 5 cm = 25 cm².

4. **Calculate the Area of Triangle ADF**: To find the area of triangle ADF, we need to determine the height from A to DF. Since MD intersects AC at point F, and M is the midpoint of BC, F is the midpoint of AC. Therefore, AF = FC = 4 cm (half of 8 cm).

5. **Determine Height**: The height from A to DF is the same as the side length of the square AMDE, which is 5 cm.

6. **Calculate the Area of Triangle ADF**: The area of triangle ADF is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 4 cm * 5 cm = 10 cm².

7. **Calculate the Area of Quadrilateral AFDE**: The area of quadrilateral AFDE is the sum of the areas of square AMDE and triangle ADF: 25 cm² + 10 cm² = 35 cm².

8. **Convert to Fraction**: The area of quadrilateral AFDE in the form of a fraction over 8 is 35/8 cm².

**Answer**: D).
