**Reasoning**:
To solve this, we first need to understand how Bart wrote the number 2023 using the digit 7. The number 2023 can be expressed as a sum of multiples of 777, 77, and 7, all composed of the digit 7.

Given:
- 1015 is written using the digit 7, 10 times.

We can write 1015 as:
777 + 77 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 1015

To express 2023 using the digit 7, we observe that:
2023 = 777 + 777 + 77 + 77 + 77 + 77 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7

We count the number of times each component (777, 77, 7) is used:
- 777 is used 2 times.
- 77 is used 4 times.
- 7 is used 13 times.

To find how many times the number 77 is used in total, we sum its occurrences:
2 (from 777) + 4 (from 77) = 6 times.

Therefore, the number 77 is used 6 times.
