Sure, let's analyze the problem and determine the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**

1. Michaela has 24 animals in total.
2. One eighth of the animals are dogs. Therefore, the number of dogs is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{8} \times 24 = 3 \text{ dogs}
   \]
3. Three quarters of the animals are not cows. Therefore, the number of cows is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]
   So, the number of cows is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 24 = 6 \text{ cows}
   \]
4. Two thirds of the animals are not cats. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   So, the number of cats is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 24 = 8 \text{ cats}
   \]
5. Now, to find the number of kangaroos, we subtract the number of dogs, cows, and cats from the total number of animals:
   \[
   24 - 3 - 6 - 8 = 7 \text{ kangaroos}
   \]
