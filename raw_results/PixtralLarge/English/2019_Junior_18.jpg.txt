To determine which fraction of the syrup should be used to obtain 2 liters of juice, we need to consider the dilution ratio and the amount of syrup available.

1. The 1-liter bottle of syrup is half full, so we have 0.5 liters of syrup.
2. The syrup shall be diluted in the ratio 1:7, meaning for every 1 part of syrup, there are 7 parts of water.
3. To find the total volume of juice made from 1 part syrup, we add the parts of syrup and water: 1 part syrup + 7 parts water = 8 parts total.
4. We want 2 liters of juice, so we set up the proportion:

   \[
   \frac{\text{syrup}}{\text{total juice}} = \frac{1}{8}
   \]

5. Let \( x \) be the amount of syrup needed to make 2 liters of juice:

   \[
   \frac{x}{2} = \frac{1}{8}
   \]

6. Solving for \( x \):

   \[
   x = 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

7. Therefore, we need \( \frac{1}{4} \) liters of syrup to make 2 liters of juice.

Reasoning: The calculation shows that \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the syrup is required to make 2 liters of juice when diluted in the ratio 1:7.
