To determine how many more marbles Lea needs so that she can place them in groups of three as well as groups of five without any marbles being left over, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5. The LCM of 3 and 5 is 15, which means Lea needs a number of marbles that is a multiple of 15 to achieve this.

Given that there are two marbles left over when grouping by 3 or by 5, Lea currently has a number of marbles that is 2 less than a multiple of 15. Therefore, she needs 2 more marbles to reach the next multiple of 15.

Reasoning: Lea needs 2 more marbles to reach the next multiple of 15, which is the least common multiple of 3 and 5.

Answer: B)
