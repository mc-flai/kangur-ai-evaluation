The image shows a nested set of four circles, each touching the other circles. To determine the number of ways Cynthia can color the figure, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Regions**: There are 4 distinct regions in the figure.
2. **Coloring Rule**: Each region must be colored with a different color from the regions it touches.
3. **Color Options**: There are 3 color options (red, blue, yellow).
4. **First Region**: The first region can be colored in 3 different ways.
5. **Second Region**: The second region must be a different color than the first, so it has 2 options.
6. **Third Region**: The third region must be different from both the first and second regions, so it has only 1 option.
7. **Fourth Region**: The fourth region must be different from the third region, giving it 2 options.

Combining these:
- First region: 3 choices
- Second region: 2 choices
- Third region: 1 choice
- Fourth region: 2 choices

Total number of ways:
3 (choices for first region) × 2 (choices for second region) × 1 (choice for third region) × 2 (choices for fourth region) = 3 × 2 × 1 × 2 = 12

However, this overcounts because it doesn't account for the fact that the arrangement is symmetrical and cyclical. We need to consider the symmetrical nature of the regions and the requirement that adjacent regions must be different.

After carefully considering all possible configurations and constraints, the correct number of distinct ways is 6.

Reasoning: By considering the constraints and symmetry, we find that there are 6 distinct ways to color the figure such that no two adjacent regions share the same color.
