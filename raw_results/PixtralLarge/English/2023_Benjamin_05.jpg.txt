**Reasoning**: To determine the number of ways Anna can build the tower, we need to consider the constraints given: she has five discs of different sizes and must use exactly four of them in a specific order (smaller on top of bigger). 

1. **Choosing 4 Discs**: First, Anna needs to choose 4 discs out of the 5 available. The number of ways to choose 4 discs from 5 is given by the combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, and \( k \) is the number of items to choose.
   
   Here, \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 4 \):
   \[
   C(5, 4) = \frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = \frac{5!}{4! \cdot 1!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4!}{4! \cdot 1} = 5
   \]

2. **Ordering the 4 Discs**: Once she has chosen 4 discs, there is only one way to arrange them according to the rule (smaller on top of bigger).

Combining these two steps, the total number of ways to build the tower is the number of ways to choose the 4 discs.

**Answer**: C).
