**Reasoning**:

In an isosceles triangle, the two base angles are equal. Given that the points K and L are added on the sides AB and BC respectively such that AK = KL = LB and KB = AC, we need to determine the measure of angle ∠ABC.

Since K and L are points on the sides AB and BC respectively, and AK = KL = LB, we know that triangle AKL is also isosceles with AK = KL. Similarly, since KB = AC, triangle KBC is also isosceles with KB = BC.

The angles in triangle KLB are equal because it is isosceles. We need to find the angle ∠ABC. Since triangle ABC is originally isosceles, the base angles ∠ABC and ∠ACB are equal. To find the measure of these angles, we subtract the vertex angle from 180° and divide by 2.

Let's denote the vertex angle ∠BAC as x. Then the two base angles ∠ABC and ∠ACB are each (180° - x) / 2.

Since AK = KL = LB and KB = AC, the triangle KLB is also isosceles. Therefore, the angles at K and L are equal.

Given the options, we can determine that the correct angle measure is the one that fits the isosceles property and the given conditions. The correct angle measure for ∠ABC is 36°.
