**Reasoning**:
To determine the perimeter of the grey area where four circles with radius 1 intersect each other, we need to understand the geometric configuration. Each intersection point between the circles forms an arc.

In such a configuration, each circle contributes to the grey area with an arc that is one-quarter of the circle. Since there are four circles, there are four such arcs. Each arc corresponds to an angle of 90 degrees, which is one-fourth of a full circle.

The perimeter contributed by each circle is therefore:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 2\pi \times 1 = \frac{\pi}{2} \]

Since there are four such arcs, the total perimeter of the grey area is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{\pi}{2} = 2\pi \]

Thus, the perimeter of the grey area is \(2\pi\).

**Answer**: D) \(2\pi\).
