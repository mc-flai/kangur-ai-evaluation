**Reasoning**:

1. We know that the two lightest kangaroos weigh 25% of the total weight of the group.
2. We also know that the three heaviest kangaroos weigh 60% of the total weight of the group.
3. Together, the two lightest and the three heaviest kangaroos account for 25% + 60% = 85% of the total weight.
4. This means that the remaining kangaroos must account for 100% - 85% = 15% of the total weight.
5. Thus, there must be additional kangaroos to make up this remaining 15%. Since we already have 2 + 3 = 5 kangaroos accounted for, adding the remaining kangaroos to account for the 15% gives us a total of 8 kangaroos.

**Answer**: C).
