To analyze this problem, we need to determine the shortest distance the ant has to walk from point A to point B considering the presence of the cylinder.

Given:
- The ant initially walked 6 meters in a straight line from A to B.
- A cylinder of height 1 meter is placed in the path.

The ant now has to walk over the cylinder. To find the shortest path, we can consider the problem as finding the shortest distance over a right circular cylinder.

When the ant reaches the cylinder, it will walk along the surface of the cylinder. The shortest path along the surface of the cylinder can be found by "unrolling" the cylinder into a flat plane. The shortest path on a flat plane between two points is a straight line.

The "unrolled" cylinder would form a rectangle where:
- The width is the circumference of the cylinder base.
- The height is the height of the cylinder.

Since the height of the cylinder is 1 meter, the shortest path involves walking 1 meter up and 1 meter down the cylinder, plus the distance on the base of the cylinder.

The total distance the ant has to walk is:
- 3 meters to the cylinder base.
- 1 meter up the cylinder.
- 1 meter down the cylinder.
- 3 meters from the cylinder base to point B.

Thus, the total distance is:
3 meters (to cylinder) + 1 meter (up cylinder) + 1 meter (down cylinder) + 3 meters (from cylinder) = 8 meters.

Reasoning: The shortest path involves walking straight to the cylinder, up and down the cylinder, and then straight to point B. The total distance is 8 meters.

Answer: A).
