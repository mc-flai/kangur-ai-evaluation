To determine which of the given cuboids can be built entirely out of 4x1x1 cuboids consisting of 2 white and 2 grey cubes, let's analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option A**:
   - This cuboid can be created by placing two 4x1x1 cuboids adjacent to each other. The arrangement of white and grey cubes matches perfectly.

2. **Option B**:
   - This cuboid requires three 4x1x1 cuboids. However, the arrangement of white and grey cubes does not match the given pattern, making it impossible to construct this cuboid with the given 4x1x1 cuboids.

3. **Option C**:
   - This cuboid can be created by placing two 4x1x1 cuboids adjacent to each other, similar to Option A. The arrangement of white and grey cubes matches perfectly.

4. **Option D**:
   - This cuboid requires three 4x1x1 cuboids. However, the arrangement of white and grey cubes does not match the given pattern, making it impossible to construct this cuboid with the given 4x1x1 cuboids.

5. **Option E**:
   - This cuboid requires four 4x1x1 cuboids. Although the size matches, the arrangement of white and grey cubes does not match the given pattern, making it impossible to construct this cuboid with the given 4x1x1 cuboids.

**Reasoning**: Options A and C can be built entirely out of the given 4x1x1 cuboids consisting of 2 white and 2 grey cubes, as they match the required arrangement.

**Answer**: A) and C).
