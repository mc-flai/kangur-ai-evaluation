**Reasoning**:
1. The frog starts on a lily pad in one of the corners of a 4x4 grid.
2. The frog can jump horizontally or vertically, always skipping at least one lily pad.
3. To determine the maximum number of lily pads the frog can land on, consider the optimal jumping pattern.
4. From the corner, the frog can make at most two jumps (one horizontal and one vertical or vice versa) before it runs out of room to move further while skipping at least one lily pad.
5. This means the frog can visit its initial lily pad, then jump to a second lily pad, and then jump to a third lily pad.
6. Therefore, the frog can land on a maximum of three different lily pads.
7. Including the initial lily pad he is sitting on, the total number of lily pads is 3 + 1 = 4.

**Answer**: E).
