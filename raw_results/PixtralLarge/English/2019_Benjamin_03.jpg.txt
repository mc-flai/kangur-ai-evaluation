**Reasoning**: 
1. There are 14 girls and 12 boys in the nursery group.
2. The total number of children in the group is 14 girls + 12 boys = 26 children.
3. Half of the group would be 26 / 2 = 13 children.
4. To determine the minimum number of girls that must be part of the group of 13 children:
   - If all 12 boys go for a walk, then at least 13 - 12 = 1 girl must be among that group.
5. Therefore, the minimum number of girls that have to be amongst the group going for a walk is 1.
