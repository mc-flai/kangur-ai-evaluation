To analyze the question, we need to determine how many different animals Thomas can make by recombining parts from a pig and a shark. Each animal is cut into three pieces: head, middle section, and tail.

- **Head**: There are 2 different heads (one from the pig and one from the shark).
- **Middle section**: There are 2 different middle sections (one from the pig and one from the shark).
- **Tail**: There are 2 different tails (one from the pig and one from the shark).

Since Thomas takes one head, one middle section, and one tail to make a new animal, we need to calculate the total number of combinations.

The total number of different animals Thomas can make is:
\[ 2 \text{ (heads)} \times 2 \text{ (middle sections)} \times 2 \text{ (tails)} = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8 \]

Thus, Thomas can create 8 different animals.

Reasoning: By multiplying the number of options for each part (head, middle section, and tail), we find the total number of different combinations possible.
Answer: E).
