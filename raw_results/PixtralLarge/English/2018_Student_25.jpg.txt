To determine the coordinates of the fourth point of intersection where the circle (through the three points of intersection of the quadratic function with the axes) intersects the graph of the function \( f(x) = x^2 + px + q \), we need to utilize the properties of circles and quadratic functions.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:

1. **Identify Points of Intersection with Axes**:
   - The quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 + px + q \) intersects the x-axis where \( f(x) = 0 \). Solving \( x^2 + px + q = 0 \) gives the roots \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \).
   - The function intersects the y-axis at \( x = 0 \), giving the point \( (0, q) \).

2. **Circle Through Three Points**:
   - The circle passes through the three points of intersection with the axes: \( (x_1, 0) \), \( (x_2, 0) \), and \( (0, q) \).

3. **Intersection with the Quadratic Function**:
   - The circle intersects the quadratic function at a fourth point. Since the circle is symmetric and passes through the roots of the quadratic, the fourth point of intersection must also satisfy the equation of the quadratic function.

4. **Coordinates of the Fourth Point**:
   - Let the fourth point be \( (x_4, y_4) \). Since it lies on the quadratic function, it satisfies \( y_4 = x_4^2 + px_4 + q \).
   - By symmetry and the properties of circles, the fourth point must be \( (-p, q) \) because it balances the other points of intersection.

Therefore, the coordinates of the fourth point of intersection are \( (-p, q) \).

**Answer**: C).
