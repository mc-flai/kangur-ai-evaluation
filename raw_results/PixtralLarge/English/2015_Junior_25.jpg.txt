**Reasoning**: To determine the length of the angle bisector in a right-angled triangle, we can use the angle bisector theorem. According to this theorem, the angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides.

In a right-angled triangle, if the angle bisector of an acute angle splits the opposite side into segments of length 1 and 2 respectively, we can denote the sides of the triangle as follows:
- Let the right-angled triangle have sides a, b, and hypotenuse c.
- Let the angle bisector split the opposite side (hypotenuse c) into segments of lengths 1 and 2.

Using the Angle Bisector Theorem, the ratio of the segments is equal to the ratio of the other two sides:
- \( \frac{1}{2} = \frac{a}{b} \)

This implies:
- \( b = 2a \)

We know from the Pythagorean theorem that:
- \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \)

Substituting \( b = 2a \) into the equation:
- \( a^2 + (2a)^2 = c^2 \)
- \( a^2 + 4a^2 = c^2 \)
- \( 5a^2 = c^2 \)

Hence, the length of the hypotenuse c is:
- \( c = \sqrt{5a^2} \)
- \( c = a\sqrt{5} \)

Given that the segments are 1 and 2, the hypotenuse c is \( \sqrt{5} \).

Thus, the length of the angle bisector is \( \sqrt{5} \).
