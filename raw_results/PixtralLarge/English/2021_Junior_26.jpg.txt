**Reasoning**:
1. Given that \( a \) and \( b \) are squares of integers, we can express \( a \) and \( b \) as \( a = n^2 \) and \( b = m^2 \) where \( n \) and \( m \) are integers.
2. The difference \( a - b \) is given to be a prime number. Therefore, \( a - b = n^2 - m^2 \) must also be a prime number.
3. Note that \( n^2 - m^2 \) can be factored as \( (n - m)(n + m) \).
4. For \( (n - m)(n + m) \) to be a prime number, one of the factors must be 1 (since prime numbers have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and the number itself).
5. Therefore, \( n - m = 1 \).
6. This implies \( n = m + 1 \).
7. Substituting \( n = m + 1 \) into \( (n + m) \) gives \( (m + 1 + m) = 2m + 1 \).
8. Thus, the prime number must be of the form \( 2m + 1 \).
9. Examining the given options, the only difference between two square numbers that is a prime number and fits this form is 256.
10. To verify, \( 256 = 16^2 - 15^2 \) which simplifies to \( (16 - 15)(16 + 15) = 1 \times 31 = 31 \), which is a prime number.
