To determine which picture shows a single large loop, we need to observe each option carefully.

**Reasoning**:
- A single large loop should be a continuous line without any intersections or branches.
- Option (A): This looks like a figure eight with two loops intersecting at the center.
- Option (B): This has two separate loops on top of each other, with one loop inside the other.
- Option (C): This also has two loops intersecting at points, forming a figure eight.
- Option (D): This consists of intersecting loops, forming two distinct loops.
- Option (E): This is a single continuous loop without any intersections.

Hence, the correct answer is E, which is a single large loop without any intersections or branches.

**Answer**: E).
