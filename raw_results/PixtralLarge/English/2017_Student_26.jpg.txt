To determine how Anna should distribute the balls to maximize her probability of winning, we need to consider the probability of Beate drawing a white ball from each arrangement.

1. **Option (A)**: Anna puts one white and one black ball into each box.
   - Probability of Beate drawing a white ball: 1/2 (since each box has one white and one black ball).

2. **Option (B)**: Anna distributes the black balls into three of the boxes and the white ones into the remaining two boxes.
   - Probability of Beate drawing a white ball:
     - If Beate chooses one of the two boxes with white balls, the probability is 1.
     - If Beate chooses one of the three boxes with black balls, the probability is 0.
     - Overall probability: (2/5) * 1 + (3/5) * 0 = 2/5 = 0.4.

3. **Option (C)**: Anna distributes the black balls into four of the boxes and puts all of the white ones into the remaining box.
   - Probability of Beate drawing a white ball:
     - If Beate chooses the box with white balls, the probability is 1.
     - If Beate chooses one of the four boxes with black balls, the probability is 0.
     - Overall probability: (1/5) * 1 + (4/5) * 0 = 1/5 = 0.2.

4. **Option (D)**: Anna puts all of the white balls into one box and then puts one black ball into each box.
   - Probability of Beate drawing a white ball:
     - If Beate chooses the box with white balls, the probability is 1.
     - If Beate chooses one of the four boxes with black balls, the probability is 0.
     - Overall probability: (1/5) * 1 + (4/5) * 0 = 1/5 = 0.2.

5. **Option (E)**: Anna puts all of the black balls into one box and then puts one white ball into each box.
   - Probability of Beate drawing a white ball:
     - If Beate chooses one of the four boxes with white balls, the probability is 1.
     - If Beate chooses the box with black balls, the probability is 0.
     - Overall probability: (4/5) * 1 + (1/5) * 0 = 4/5 = 0.8.

The highest probability of Beate drawing a white ball is in Option (E), which is 0.8.

Reasoning: Option (E) maximizes the probability of Beate drawing a white ball, thereby maximizing Anna's chances of winning.
Answer: E).
