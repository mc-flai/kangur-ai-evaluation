To determine the percentage of the surface area of the iceberg in contact with the air, we need to understand the geometry of the situation.

1. **Volume Understanding**:
   - The submerged volume of the iceberg is 96.4% of the total volume.
   - This means the volume above water is 3.6% of the total volume.

2. **Surface Area Analysis**:
   - Since the iceberg is in the form of a cube, we know that the faces of the cube are square.
   - If the iceberg has three edges in contact with the water, the submerged part will have three full faces and three half faces (since the iceberg has three dimensions).

3. **Calculation of Surface Areas**:
   - Total surface area of a cube = 6 * (side length)^2.
   - Submerged surface area includes three full faces and three half faces, which equals 4.5 faces.
   - Therefore, the surface area in contact with the air is the total surface area minus the submerged surface area, which equals 6 - 4.5 = 1.5 faces.

4. **Percentage Calculation**:
   - The surface area in contact with the air is 1.5 out of the 6 faces.
   - Percentage = (1.5 / 6) * 100 = 25%.
  
However, there could be a misunderstanding in interpreting the solution. Since the submerged volume is very high, the visible portion is very small, and the percentage of surface area in contact with the air would be much smaller. Let's re-evaluate:

- Submerged volume = 96.4% implies 3.6% is above water.
- For a cube, this translates to a very small portion of the surface area.

Given the provided options, the closest reasonable estimate is 9%.

Reasoning: The submerged volume is 96.4%, which leaves 3.6% of the iceberg above water. Since the iceberg is a cube and three edges are submerged, the surface area in contact with the air would be a small fraction of the total surface area. The closest option to this small fraction is 9%.

Answer: A).
