**Reasoning:** The problem states that the sum of the digits of each of the two consecutive positive whole numbers is divisible by 7. Let's denote the smaller of the two consecutive numbers as \( n \). The next consecutive number is \( n + 1 \).

Let's consider the properties of numbers:
- The sum of the digits of \( n \) is divisible by 7.
- The sum of the digits of \( n + 1 \) is also divisible by 7.

Let's analyze the possible sums of digits for consecutive numbers:
- If the sum of the digits of \( n \) is divisible by 7, the sum of the digits of \( n + 1 \) must also be divisible by 7.
- The minimum number of digits required for \( n \) to have a sum of digits divisible by 7 should be checked with the smallest possible digits such that \( n \) and \( n + 1 \) both meet the condition.

Checking the options:
- If \( n \) has 3 digits, the next number \( n + 1 \) could have 4 digits (e.g., 999 and 1000). The sum of the digits of 999 is 27 (divisible by 7), and the sum of the digits of 1000 is 1 (not divisible by 7). Hence, 3 digits are not sufficient.
- If \( n \) has 4 digits, the next number \( n + 1 \) could have 4 or 5 digits. The smallest 4-digit number with a sum of digits divisible by 7 is 1001 (sum is 2, not divisible by 7). Hence, 4 digits are not sufficient.
- For 5 digits, the smallest number is 10000. The sum of the digits of 10000 is 1 (not divisible by 7). Hence, 5 digits are not sufficient.
- For 6 digits, the smallest number is 100000. The sum of the digits of 100000 is 1 (not divisible by 7). Hence, 6 digits are not sufficient.
- For 7 digits, the smallest number is 1000000. The sum of the digits of 1000000 is 1 (not divisible by 7). Hence, 7 digits are not sufficient.

However, considering the nature of the problem and the divisibility rule, 6 digits are necessary for both numbers to have sums of digits divisible by 7. For example, 999999 and 1000000, where 999999 has a sum of digits 42 (divisible by 7), and 1000000 has a sum of digits 1 (not divisible by 7). But in this case, 999998 (sum 49, divisible by 7) and 999999 (sum 42, divisible by 7) are valid.
