**Reasoning:**

1. Let the original fraction be \(\frac{a}{b}\).
2. The numerator is increased by 40%, so the new numerator is \(a + 0.4a = 1.4a\).
3. We need the new fraction to be double the original fraction, which means \(\frac{1.4a}{b'} = 2 \cdot \frac{a}{b}\).
4. Simplifying this, we get \(\frac{1.4a}{b'} = \frac{2a}{b}\).
5. Cross-multiplying gives \(1.4a \cdot b = 2a \cdot b'\).
6. Dividing both sides by \(a\) (assuming \(a \neq 0\)), we get \(1.4b = 2b'\).
7. Solving for \(b'\), we find \(b' = \frac{1.4b}{2} = 0.7b\).
8. This means the denominator \(b\) must be decreased by 30% to get \(0.7b\).

**Answer:** C).
