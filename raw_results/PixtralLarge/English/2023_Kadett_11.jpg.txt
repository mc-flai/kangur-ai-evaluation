**Reasoning**: Let's decode the given symbols step-by-step:

- The symbols correspond to three consecutive natural numbers in increasing order.
- The given symbols are: □, ◇, ♡, △, ⬟.
- □, ◇, ♡ represent the first three numbers, and since they are consecutive natural numbers, we can assume they represent 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
- The next set of symbols △, ⬟ represent the numbers 4 and 5 respectively.

Following this pattern, the next number should be 6. To determine which option represents 6, look for the symbol that comes after ⬟ in the sequence. From the given options (A) ♡⬟△, (B) □♡□, (C) ♡△⬟, (D) ♡⬟□, and (E) ♡△♡, the symbol ♡ comes after ⬟ in (C) ♡△⬟.

**Answer**: C).
