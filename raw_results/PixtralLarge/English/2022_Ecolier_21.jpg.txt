To solve this problem, we need to determine the perimeters of the two gardens and compare them, since Ahmed and Sara are walking with the same speed.

1. **Calculate the perimeter of the square garden (Ahmed's garden):**
   - Each side of the square garden is 5 meters.
   - The perimeter of a square is given by 4 times the length of one side.
   - Perimeter of Ahmed's garden = 4 * 5m = 20 meters.

2. **Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden (Sara's garden):**
   - The lengths of the sides of the rectangular garden are 10 meters and 5 meters.
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2 times the sum of the lengths of the two adjacent sides.
   - Perimeter of Sara's garden = 2 * (10m + 5m) = 2 * 15m = 30 meters.

3. **Determine the number of rounds needed for Ahmed to meet Sara:**
   - Since Ahmed and Sara walk with the same speed, the number of rounds Ahmed needs to walk to meet Sara again is the ratio of the two perimeters.
   - The ratio of Sara's perimeter to Ahmed's perimeter = 30m / 20m = 3/2 = 1.5.
   - Therefore, Ahmed needs to walk **2 rounds** while Sara walks **1 round** for them to meet again for the first time.

Reasoning: The perimeter of the square garden is 20 meters and the perimeter of the rectangular garden is 30 meters. Ahmed needs to walk 2 rounds to meet Sara who walks 1 round.

Answer: B)
