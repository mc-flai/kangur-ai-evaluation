To determine the lowest possible value for \( S \) given that four integer numbers have a sum \( S \) and a product of 9, we need to consider the possible combinations of four integers that satisfy these conditions.

1. **Identify the integer pairs that multiply to 9**:
   - The pairs are: \( (1, 9) \), \( (-1, -9) \), \( (3, 3) \), and \( (-3, -3) \).

2. **Determine combinations of four integers that multiply to 9**:
   - We need to find combinations of four integers that multiply to 9. 
   - Possible combinations include: \( (1, 1, 3, 3) \), \( (-1, -1, -3, -3) \), \( (1, 1, 1, 9) \), \( (-1, -1, -1, -9) \), etc.

3. **Calculate the sum \( S \) for each combination**:
   - For \( (1, 1, 3, 3) \): \( S = 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 \)
   - For \( (-1, -1, -3, -3) \): \( S = -1 - 1 - 3 - 3 = -8 \)
   - For \( (1, 1, 1, 9) \): \( S = 1 + 1 + 1 + 9 = 12 \)
   - For \( (-1, -1, -1, -9) \): \( S = -1 - 1 - 1 - 9 = -12 \)

4. **Identify the lowest possible value for \( S \)**:
   - The lowest value from the calculated sums is \( -12 \).

Reasoning: The lowest possible value for \( S \) is derived by considering combinations of four integers that multiply to 9 and finding the combination with the smallest sum. The combination \( (-1, -1, -1, -9) \) yields the sum \( -12 \).
