**Reasoning**:
1. The bus leaves the airport every three minutes.
2. The car takes 35 minutes to travel from the airport to the city centre.
3. To find out how many buses the car overtakes, we need to determine how many buses leave the airport during the 35 minutes it takes the car to travel to the city centre.
4. We calculate the number of buses that leave in 35 minutes by dividing the car's travel time by the interval between bus departures: 35 minutes / 3 minutes per bus = 11.67.
5. Since you cannot have a fraction of a bus, we consider only the whole number of buses. Therefore, 11 buses will have left by the time the car reaches the city centre.
6. Note: The bus that starts at the same time as the car does not count in these calculations, as per the problem statement.
