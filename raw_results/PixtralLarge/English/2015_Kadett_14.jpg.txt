**Reasoning**:
- The given equation is: \(2 * 0 * 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 * 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 * 1 * 5 = 0\).
- Any multiplication involving zero results in zero.
- Therefore, the equation is already correct as \(0 * \text{anything} = 0\).
- Since any number of stars can be replaced by "+" without affecting the result, the smallest number of stars that can be replaced by "+" is zero, meaning no replacements are necessary for the equation to be correct.
- The smallest number of stars that can be replaced by "+" is 1, because no replacements are necessary, but the smallest meaningful change is replacing one star.

**Answer**: A)
