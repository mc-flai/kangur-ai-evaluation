To determine the number that Riki needs to write in the zone marked "?", we need to understand the rule for the numbers in each zone: each number should be the sum of the numbers in its adjacent zones.

1. Identify the adjacent zones to the zone marked "?". From the diagram, the zone marked "?" is adjacent to the zones with numbers 4, 2, and the unknown number in the center.
2. Sum the numbers in the adjacent zones to find the number for the zone marked "?".
   The sum is calculated as follows:
   \[
   4 + 2 + ? = \text{sum of adjacent zones}
   \]
   Since the center zone has the number 1, the sum of the adjacent zones would be:
   \[
   4 + 2 + 1 = 7
   \]

3. The number for the zone marked "?" should be 7.

Thus, we need to find the option that corresponds to the number 7.

Reasoning: The sum of the numbers in the adjacent zones to the zone marked "?" is 7. Therefore, the number to be placed in the zone marked "?" is 7.
Answer: C).
