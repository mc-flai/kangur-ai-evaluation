**Reasoning**: To determine which cube matches the one Julia created, we need to consider that drawing on the side of a cardboard sheet and then folding it into a cube means the circles on the faces of the cube will appear in a specific pattern. When the drawing is made on the cardboard sheet, the circles on the adjacent faces align when folded.

In the given diagram, the circles are positioned such that each face adjacent to the one with two red circles has no more than two circles of the same color.

- Option (A) has two purple circles on adjacent faces, which is not consistent with the diagram.
- Option (B) has three green circles on adjacent faces, which is not consistent with the diagram.
- Option (C) has two purple circles on adjacent faces, which is not consistent with the diagram.
- Option (D) has three orange circles on adjacent faces, which is not consistent with the diagram.
- Option (E) is the only option that matches the pattern given in the diagram, with no more than two circles of the same color on adjacent faces.

**Answer**: E).
