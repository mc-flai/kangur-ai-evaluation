To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest number of shapes required to completely cover the given paper boat.

First, let's break down the shapes given:
1. A square.
2. A parallelogram.

Next, we need to plan how to use these shapes to cover the entire boat.

1. **Identify the areas of the boat:**
   - The boat consists of a central rectangle, two triangular sides, and a smaller rectangular portion at the top center.

2. **Cover the central rectangle:**
   - The square can cover part of the central rectangle.
   - The parallelogram can be used to cover the remaining central area.

3. **Cover the triangular sides:**
   - Each triangular side can be covered by one parallelogram.

4. **Cover the smaller rectangular portion at the top center:**
   - The smaller rectangular portion can be covered by a square.

By examining the boat and strategically placing the shapes, we can cover the entire boat with the following placement:
   - One square to cover the smaller rectangular portion at the top center.
   - One square to cover part of the central rectangle.
   - Three parallelograms to cover the remaining central area and the two triangular sides.

Therefore, the smallest number of shapes needed is 4 (2 squares and 2 parallelograms).

Reasoning: By strategically placing the shapes, we can cover the entire boat using 2 squares and 2 parallelograms.
Answer: A).
