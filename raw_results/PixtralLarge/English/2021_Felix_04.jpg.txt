To determine where Michael should punch the hole to go through all four identical pieces of paper, we need to identify the point that is common to all four pieces.

Looking at the image, we can see that all four pieces overlap at only one specific point. Let's analyze the layout:

- The four pieces are labeled with points A, B, C, D, and E.
- Point A is not common to all four pieces.
- Point B is not common to all four pieces.
- Point C is not common to all four pieces.
- Point D is not common to all four pieces.
- Point E is the only point that is common to all four pieces.

Therefore, Michael should punch the hole at point E to ensure it goes through all four pieces.

Reasoning: Point E is the only point that is common to all four overlapping pieces of paper, so Michael should punch the hole there.
Answer: E).
