To determine what percent of the area of the circle is the white part, outside the triangle, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information**:
   - The grey area (overlapping part of the circle and triangle) is 45% of the entire shape.
   - The white part of the triangle is 40% of the total area of the shape.

2. **Calculate the total area of the triangle**:
   - The white part inside the triangle is 40% of the total area of the shape.
   - Therefore, the entire triangle (grey part + white part) is 45% (grey) + 40% (white) = 85% of the total area of the shape.

3. **Determine the area of the circle**:
   - Since the grey area is the overlapping part of the circle and triangle, and it is 45% of the total area, the rest of the circle (non-overlapping white part) must be part of the remaining area of the shape that is not part of the triangle.
   - The entire shape consists of the circle and the triangle (overlapping).
   - If the triangle is 85% and the circle overlaps with the triangle, the entire area of the circle must be 100% - the non-overlapping part of the triangle.

4. **Calculate the white part of the circle outside the triangle**:
   - The total area of the shape is 100%.
   - The white part outside the triangle includes the non-overlapping part of the circle.
   - Since the triangle is 85% of the total area, the remaining 15% is the white part of the circle outside the triangle.
   - However, we know that the overlapping part is 45%, so the remaining part of the circle outside the triangle is 100% - 85% = 15%.

5. **Determine the percentage of the circle that is the white part**:
   - The white part of the circle outside the triangle is 15% of the total area of the shape.
   - Since the circle itself occupies the remaining part of the shape that is not the triangle, and the triangle occupies 85%, the circle must be 100% - 85% = 15%.

Therefore, the white part of the circle outside the triangle is 15% of the total area of the shape, which corresponds to 15% of the circle's area.

Reasoning: The white part of the circle outside the triangle is 15% of the total area of the shape, which corresponds to 15% of the circle's area.
Answer: B) 25%.
