**Reasoning**:
1. The number 2022 is comprised of four digits.
2. Karo has already formed the first two digits using some matches.
3. Each digit in 2022 requires:
   - The digit '2': Each '2' requires 5 matches.
   - The digit '0': Each '0' requires 6 matches.
4. The number 2022 uses the digit '2' twice and the digit '0' twice.
5. Calculating the total matches used for the digits:
   - Two '2's: 2 * 5 = 10 matches
   - Two '0's: 2 * 6 = 12 matches
6. Total matches used to form 2022: 10 + 12 = 22 matches.
7. Karo started with 30 matches.
8. Matches left after forming 2022: 30 - 22 = 8 matches.

**Answer**: D) 19.
