To determine who was wrong, we need to evaluate the correctness of each statement:

- **Adam**: "Yesterday was Wednesday." If today is Monday, then yesterday was indeed Sunday, so Adam is incorrect.
- **Beto**: "Tomorrow will be Friday." If today is Monday, then tomorrow is Tuesday, so Beto is incorrect.
- **Carlos**: "The day before yesterday was Tuesday." If today is Monday, then the day before yesterday was Saturday, so Carlos is incorrect.
- **David**: "The day after tomorrow is Saturday." If today is Monday, then the day after tomorrow is Wednesday, so David is incorrect.
- **Eli**: "Today is Monday." If today is Monday, then Eli is correct.

Since Adam, Beto, Carlos, and David are all incorrect based on their statements, and Eli's statement is correct, we can conclude that they are all wrong except Eli.

Reasoning: Adam, Beto, Carlos, and David all made incorrect statements about the days of the week given that today is Monday.
