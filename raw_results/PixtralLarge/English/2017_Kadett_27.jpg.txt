To solve this problem, let's analyze the structure formed by the cubes and how many tunnels and cubes are used.

1. **Understanding the structure**: 
   - The diagram shows a 3x3x3 cube structure.
   - Each big cube in the 3x3x3 structure has 9 small tunnels going straight through it.

2. **Calculating total cubes**:
   - There are 27 small cubes in a 3x3x3 structure (3^3 = 27).

3. **Determining unused cubes**:
   - Each tunnel in the structure requires 3 small cubes.
   - There are 9 tunnels.
   - Total cubes used for the tunnels: 9 tunnels * 3 small cubes per tunnel = 27 small cubes.
   - Total cubes available: 125.
   - Total cubes used for the tunnels: 27.
   - Therefore, the number of unused cubes: 125 - 27 = 98.

4. **Identifying the correct answer**:
   - The number of unused cubes is 98, which is not an option in the given choices.
   - Given the options, the closest number to the calculated result is 45, which implies some cubes might be shared or used differently.

Reasoning: The closest matching answer to the derived number based on the provided options is 45.
Answer: B) 45.
