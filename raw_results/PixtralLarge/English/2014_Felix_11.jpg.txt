**Reasoning**: To solve this problem, we need to count the numbers that can be formed using only the digits 1, 2, or 3, and lie between 10 and 32.

1. Start by listing the numbers that fit the criteria:
   - Single-digit numbers are not considered because they are not greater than 10.
   - Two-digit numbers between 10 and 32 can be: 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32.

2. Verify if these numbers meet the criteria:
   - All these numbers use only the digits 1, 2, or 3.
   - They are all greater than 10 and smaller than 32.

3. Count the numbers:
   - There are 8 such numbers.

**Answer**: E).
