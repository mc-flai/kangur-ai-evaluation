To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the distances each child would cover if they are choosing the longest path along the edges from one of the corners to the middle of one of the edges.

1. **Perimeter Calculation**: 
   - The perimeter of the swimming pool is calculated as follows:
     \[ 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{length}) = 2 \times (10 \text{ m} + 25 \text{ m}) = 2 \times 35 \text{ m} = 70 \text{ m} \]

2. **Distance to the Middle of an Edge**:
   - If the instructor is sitting in the middle of one of the longer edges (25 m), each of the children will travel half the length of that edge to reach the instructor.
   - Therefore, the distance each child travels along the longer edge is:
     \[ \frac{25 \text{ m}}{2} = 12.5 \text{ m} \]
   - The remaining part of the perimeter to be covered by each child is:
     \[ 70 \text{ m} - 12.5 \text{ m} = 57.5 \text{ m} \]
   - So the total distance covered by each child is:
     \[ 57.5 \text{ m} + 12.5 \text{ m} = 70 \text{ m} \]

3. **Total Distance Covered by Four Children**:
   - Since there are four children, the total distance covered by all four children is:
     \[ 4 \times 57.5 \text{ m} = 230 \text{ m} \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - None of the provided answers (A, B, C, D, E) exactly matches with 230 m. However, the closest option to 230m is 210m.

Reasoning: The total distance covered by the four children, each taking the longest path along the edges to the middle of one of the edges, sums up to 230 meters, with the closest option provided being 210 meters.

Answer: E)
