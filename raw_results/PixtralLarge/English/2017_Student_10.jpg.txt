To determine which function has the most intersections with the graph of \( f(x) = x \), we need to consider how each given function interacts with the line \( y = x \).

Here are the functions given:
(A) \( g_1(x) = x^2 \)
(B) \( g_2(x) = x^3 \)
(C) \( g_3(x) = x^4 \)
(D) \( g_4(x) = -x^4 \)
(E) \( g_5(x) = -x \)

Now, let's analyze each function to see how many times it intersects with the line \( y = x \):

1. **\( g_1(x) = x^2 \)**:
   - The function \( g_1(x) = x^2 \) is a parabola opening upwards. It intersects \( y = x \) at the points \( (0,0) \) and \( (1,1) \).
   - Number of intersections: 2.

2. **\( g_2(x) = x^3 \)**:
   - The function \( g_2(x) = x^3 \) is a cubic function that passes through the origin and increases more steeply than \( y = x \) for \( x > 1 \). It intersects \( y = x \) only at \( (0,0) \).
   - Number of intersections: 1.

3. **\( g_3(x) = x^4 \)**:
   - The function \( g_3(x) = x^4 \) is a quartic function that increases more steeply than \( y = x \) for \( x > 1 \). It intersects \( y = x \) at the points \( (0,0) \) and \( (1,1) \).
   - Number of intersections: 2.

4. **\( g_4(x) = -x^4 \)**:
   - The function \( g_4(x) = -x^4 \) is a quartic function opening downwards. It intersects \( y = x \) at points where \( -x^4 = x \). Solving \( -x^4 = x \) gives \( x^4 + x = 0 \), which has roots at \( x = 0 \) and other points depending on the solution to the polynomial equation. Typically, this function will have more than two intersections.
   - Number of intersections: More than 2.

5. **\( g_5(x) = -x \)**:
   - The function \( g_5(x) = -x \) is a straight line with a negative slope. It intersects \( y = x \) only at the origin \( (0,0) \).
   - Number of intersections: 1.

Based on this analysis, the function \( g_4(x) = -x^4 \) has the most intersections with the graph of \( f(x) = x \).

Reasoning: The function \( g_4(x) = -x^4 \) has more intersections with \( y = x \) compared to the other given functions.

Answer: D).
