To determine which image correctly represents the three vases when seen from above, we need to consider the amount of water in each vase and how it would look from the top.

- Vase I has 4 liters of water.
- Vase II has 3 liters of water.
- Vase III has 4 liters of water.

Seen from above, the vases should show the relative amounts of water they contain. Since vase I and vase III have the same amount of water (4 liters), they should look identical from the top. Vase II, having 3 liters of water, should look different from vases I and III.

Let's analyze the options:

- Option (A) shows vase I partially filled, vase II empty, and vase III full. This does not match the given water levels.
- Option (B) shows vase I partially filled, vase II empty, and vase III full. This also does not match the given water levels.
- Option (C) shows vase I partially filled, vase II partially filled but less than vases I and III, and vase III partially filled. This matches the given water levels.
- Option (D) shows vase I partially filled, vase II empty, and vase III full. This does not match the given water levels.
- Option (E) shows vase I partially filled, vase II empty, and vase III full. This does not match the given water levels.

Reasoning: Vases I and III should look the same from above since they both have 4 liters of water, and vase II should look different since it has 3 liters of water. Option (C) is the only one that matches this description.

Answer: C).
