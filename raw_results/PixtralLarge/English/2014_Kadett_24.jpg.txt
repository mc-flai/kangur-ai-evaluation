**Reasoning**:
1. Let's denote the number of questions solved first by Jan as \( x \) and the number of questions solved first by Eva as \( y \).
2. Jan solved 60 questions, so he gets 4 points for \( x \) questions and 1 point for the remaining (60 - \( x \)) questions.
3. Similarly, Eva solved 60 questions, so she gets 1 point for \( y \) questions and 4 points for the remaining (60 - \( y \)) questions.
4. The total points they scored together is 312.

The equations for total points can be written as:
\[ 4x + (60 - x) + y + 4(60 - y) = 312 \]
\[ 4x + 60 - x + y + 240 - 4y = 312 \]
\[ 3x - 3y + 300 = 312 \]
\[ 3x - 3y = 12 \]
\[ x - y = 4 \]

So, the total number of questions solved by both Jan and Eva is:
\[ x + y + (60 - x) + (60 - y) = 120 + 4 = 124 \]

Therefore, the number of questions solved by both Jan and Eva is 56.
