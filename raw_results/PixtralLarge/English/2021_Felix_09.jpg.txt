To solve the problem of determining how many pieces of the ribbon Edmund finished with, we need to analyze the image. The image shows a ribbon spiraling around an object (like a pole or a tree) and then being cut with a vertical line from top to bottom.

Each time the ribbon spirals around the object, it creates an additional segment upon cutting vertically. By counting the visible segments created by the vertical cut, we can determine the total number of pieces.

From the image:
- The ribbon spirals around the object 3 times, creating 3 loops.
- The vertical cut will intersect with the ribbon 3 times plus an additional piece at the top where the ribbon is tied.

Thus, the total number of pieces will be these 3 segments from the loops plus the top piece, making a total of 4 pieces. However, an extra piece is usually counted at the bottom as well, making it 5 pieces. As the ribbon has a starting and ending point, it creates one more piece.

Based on this, the correct answer is:

Reasoning: The ribbon spirals around the object 3 times, and it is cut vertically, which creates 5 pieces when considering the intersections at the top and bottom.
Answer: D).
