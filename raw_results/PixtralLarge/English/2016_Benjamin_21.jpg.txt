**Reasoning**:
The problem asks for the minimum number of additional little triangles Clara must add to complete the big triangle. To solve this, we need to determine how many little triangles are already in place and how many more are needed to form the big triangle.

From the diagram, we can see that the big triangle is composed of 9 little triangles (3 rows with 1, 2, and 3 triangles respectively, and 3 more triangles on top).

Clara has already put 5 triangles together, so she needs 9 - 5 = 4 more triangles to complete the big triangle.

**Answer**: B)
