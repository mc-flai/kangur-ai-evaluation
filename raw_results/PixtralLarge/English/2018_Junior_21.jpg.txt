**Reasoning**:
1. The problem states that the sum of the numbers is 2018 and the product of all these numbers is also 2018.
2. Since the sum of the numbers is 2018, it means that at least one of the numbers must be 2018 because the product of these numbers is also 2018.
3. If there is more than one number and any of the other numbers is greater than 1, the product would exceed 2018.
4. Therefore, the only way to satisfy both the sum and the product being 2018 is if there is exactly one number on the board, and that number is 2018.

**Answer**: C)

**Explanation**:
- If the number 2018 is the only number on the board, then the sum is 2018 and the product is also 2018.
- Having any other number would either increase the sum or change the product to something other than 2018, violating the given conditions.

Thus, the correct answer is C) 2018.
