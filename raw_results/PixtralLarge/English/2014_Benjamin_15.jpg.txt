**Reasoning**:
1. The total number of guests seated at tables with 3 or 4 chairs is 36.
2. The total number of guests seated by the restaurant is 72.
3. Since the restaurant seats 72 guests and 36 of them are seated at tables with 3 or 4 chairs, the remaining 72 - 36 = 36 guests must be seated at tables with 6 chairs.
4. There are 16 tables in total.
5. The number of tables with 6 chairs required to seat 36 guests can be found by 36 / 6 = 6 tables.
6. Therefore, the number of tables with 3 or 4 chairs is 16 - 6 = 10 tables.
7. Now, we need to determine how many of these 10 tables have 3 chairs.
8. Let x be the number of tables with 3 chairs. Then, the number of tables with 4 chairs is 10 - x.
9. The total number of guests seated at tables with 3 or 4 chairs is 3x + 4(10 - x) = 36.
10. Simplifying, we get 3x + 40 - 4x = 36, which leads to -x + 40 = 36.
11. Solving for x, we get x = 4.
12. Therefore, there are 4 tables with 3 chairs.
