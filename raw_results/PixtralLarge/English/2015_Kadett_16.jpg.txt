**Reasoning**: To determine the total number of leaves on the bush, we need to consider the two types of twigs:
1. Twigs with 5 leaves each.
2. Twigs with 2 leaves each.

Given that there are 10 twigs in total, let's denote the number of twigs with 5 leaves as x and the number of twigs with 2 leaves as y. We know that x + y = 10.

The total number of leaves (T) can be calculated as:

T = 5x + 2y

Since x + y = 10, we can express y as 10 - x. Substituting y in the total leaves equation:

T = 5x + 2(10 - x)
T = 5x + 20 - 2x
T = 3x + 20

Now, we need to check the given options to see which total number of leaves is possible:

(A) 45
(B) 39
(C) 37
(D) 31

Let's check if any of these options satisfy the equation T = 3x + 20:

For (A) 45:
45 = 3x + 20
25 = 3x
x = 25/3 (Not an integer, hence not possible)

For (B) 39:
39 = 3x + 20
19 = 3x
x = 19/3 (Not an Integer, hence not possible)

For (C) 37:
37 = 3x + 20
17 = 3x
x = 17/3 (Not an Integer, hence not possible)

For (D) 31:
31 = 3x + 20
11 = 3x
x = 11/3 (Not an Integer, hence not possible)

Since none of the options A, B, C, or D satisfy the equation with an integer value for x, the correct answer is:

**Answer**: E).
