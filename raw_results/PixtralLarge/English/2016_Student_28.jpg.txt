**Reasoning**: The problem states that a prime number \( p \) divides the sum of all positive whole numbers from 1 to \( n \), but none of the summands. The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:

\[ S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \]

Since \( p \) must be a prime number that divides \( S \) but none of the summands (individual integers from 1 to \( n \)), \( p \) must be greater than \( n \). Furthermore, \( p \) must satisfy the condition that \( (n + 1) \) is an even number (since \( n(n + 1) \) must be divisible by 2, making \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \) an integer). Thus, \( n \) must be odd for \( (n + 1) \) to be even.

Given this, we are looking for \( n + p \) to be odd because an odd number plus an even number is odd. Therefore, we need to find an odd number from the given choices.

- (A) 217: Odd
- (B) 221: Odd
- (C) 229: Odd
- (D) 245: Odd
- (E) 269: Odd

Any of the options could be a possible answer since all are sums of odd and even numbers. However, we need to ensure \( p \) is a prime number greater than \( n \). The problem implies that \( p \) is a reasonably large prime number that, when added to \( n \), falls within the given options. Upon reviewing the choices, 269 stands out as a reasonably large value.

Thus, the correct choice would be E (269), as it is a sum of an odd number \( n \) and a prime number \( p \).

**Answer**: E)
