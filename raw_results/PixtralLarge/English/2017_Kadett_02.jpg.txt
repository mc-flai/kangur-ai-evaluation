To determine the time 17 hours after 17:00 (5:00 PM), we need to add 17 hours to 17:00.

1. Start with the initial time: 17:00 (5:00 PM).
2. Add 17 hours to 17:00.

   17:00 + 17 hours = 34:00.

3. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we need to subtract 24 hours from 34:00 to find the time on the next day.

   34:00 - 24:00 = 10:00.

So, 17 hours after 17:00 is 10:00 the next day.

Reasoning: Adding 17 hours to 17:00 results in 34:00, and subtracting 24 hours gives 10:00 the next day.
Answer: B).
