To solve this problem, we need to determine the greatest number of odd sums that can be obtained from the first 1000 positive integers.

### Reasoning:
1. **Identify the series of numbers**: The first 1000 positive integers start from 1 to 1000.
2. **Sum of three adjacent numbers**: Consider three adjacent numbers \( a, b, c \). The sum \( S = a + b + c \).
3. **Parity of sums**: For a sum to be odd, it must consist of either:
   - Three odd numbers (odd + odd + odd = odd)
   - Two even numbers and one odd number (even + even + odd = odd)
4. **Distribution of odd and even numbers**:
   - In the first 1000 positive integers, there are 500 odd numbers and 500 even numbers.
   - Since we are considering three adjacent numbers, the possible combinations are either all odd or a mix of odd and even.
5. **Maximizing odd sums**:
   - To maximize the number of odd sums, we need to maximize the occurrences of three odd numbers together or two even and one odd number together.
   - The maximum number of odd sums occurs when we group the numbers such that we get the highest possible odd sums.

### Calculation:
1. **Grouping of numbers**:
   - If we group the numbers in sets of three, we can have combinations like (1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), etc.
   - Each group of three consecutive numbers will have one odd sum if it contains two even numbers and one odd number.
2. **Counting the groups**:
   - There are 1000 numbers, so we can form 998 groups of three consecutive numbers (since the last two numbers won't form a complete group).
   - Each group can potentially contribute one odd sum.
3. **Maximum odd sums**:
   - Therefore, the maximum number of odd sums that can be obtained is 997 (since the last group might not contribute to an odd sum).

### Answer:
Reasoning: By analyzing the distribution of odd and even numbers and the possible sums of three adjacent numbers, we find that the greatest number of odd sums that can be obtained is 997.
