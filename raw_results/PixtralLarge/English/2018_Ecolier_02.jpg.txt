**Reasoning**:
1. Susanne is 6 years old.
2. Lisa is 2 years younger than Susanne, so Lisa is 6 - 2 = 4 years old.
3. Max is 2 years older than Susanne, so Max is 6 + 2 = 8 years old.
4. To find the total age of all three siblings, add their ages together: 6 (Susanne) + 4 (Lisa) + 8 (Max) = 18 years.

**Answer**: D) 18.
