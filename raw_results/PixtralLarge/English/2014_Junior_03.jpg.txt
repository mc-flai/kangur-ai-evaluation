**Reasoning**: To determine the correct inequalities for the lengths a, b, and c shown in the image, we need to compare the lengths of the different pieces of wire.

- a is 3 units long (since it spans 3 squares).
- b is 5 units long (since it spans 5 squares).
- c is 7 units long (since it spans 7 squares).

Given these measurements, we can set up the inequalities:
- a < b < c (since 3 < 5 < 7).

This fits option (A) a < b < c.

**Answer**: A).
