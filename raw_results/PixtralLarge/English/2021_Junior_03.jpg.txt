To determine the correct answer for question 3, we need to analyze the lengths of the paths \( P \), \( Q \), and \( R \) shown in the equilateral triangle diagram.

**Reasoning**:
1. **Path \( P \)**: This path goes directly from the upper corner to the lower right corner, and it is the shortest possible path along one side of the triangle.
2. **Path \( Q \)**: This path starts from the upper corner, moves horizontally, then vertically down to the lower right corner. Because it includes horizontal and vertical segments, it is longer than path \( P \).
3. **Path \( R \)**: This path also starts from the upper corner but follows a more complex route with multiple horizontal and vertical segments before reaching the lower right corner. This makes it the longest of the three paths.

Given this analysis, we can compare the lengths:
- \( P \) is the shortest path.
- \( Q \) is longer than \( P \) but shorter than \( R \).
- \( R \) is the longest path.

Therefore, the correct relationship is \( P < Q < R \).
