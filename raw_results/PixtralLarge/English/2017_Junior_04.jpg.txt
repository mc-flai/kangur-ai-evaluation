**Reasoning**: Maria has 24 Euros and each of her 3 sisters has 12 Euros. In total, Maria and her sisters have 24 + 3*12 = 24 + 36 = 60 Euros. If all four of them are to have the same amount, each should have 60 / 4 = 15 Euros.

To make sure each sister has 15 Euros, Maria needs to give away 24 - 15 = 9 Euros. Since she has three sisters, she should give each 9 / 3 = 3 Euros.
