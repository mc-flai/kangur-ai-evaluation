**Reasoning:** To determine the number of children holding another child's hand with their right hand, we need to analyze the image carefully. The children holding hands with their right hand are the ones who either face forwards and are on the left side of another child or are facing backwards and are on the right side of another child. 

From left to right, let’s examine each child:
1. The first child is facing forwards and is holding the second child’s hand with her right hand.
2. The second child is facing backwards and is holding the third child’s hand with his right hand.
3. The third child is facing forwards and is holding the fourth child’s hand with her right hand.
4. The fourth child is facing backwards and is holding the fifth child’s hand with his right hand.
5. The fifth child is facing forwards and is holding the sixth child’s hand with her right hand.
6. The sixth child is facing backwards and is holding the seventh child’s hand with his right hand.

Hence, all six children shown are holding another child's hand with their right hand.
