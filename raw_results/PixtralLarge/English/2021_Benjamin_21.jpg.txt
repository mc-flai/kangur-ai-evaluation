To determine which two people are sitting next to Carina, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Ann is not next to Bob.**
2. **Dan is next to Ed.**
3. **Bob is not next to Dan.**

From point 3, since Bob is not next to Dan, and Dan is next to Ed (point 2), it means Bob cannot be next to Ed either. Therefore, Bob must be on the opposite side of the table from Dan and Ed.

Given point 1, Ann is not next to Bob, which means Ann can be next to Dan or Ed.

Since Dan and Ed are next to each other and Bob is not next to Dan or Ed, Carina must be next to Dan and Ed.

Thus, the two people sitting next to Carina must be Dan and Ed.

Reasoning: Based on the conditions provided, Dan and Ed must be the ones sitting next to Carina.
Answer: C).
