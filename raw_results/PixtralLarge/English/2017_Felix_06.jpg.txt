To solve question 6, we need to understand the movement of a Ferris wheel. When the Ferris wheel turns, each seat moves in a circular path. Ben is now in the position where Jim was beforehand, which means Jim has moved to the next position in the circular motion of the Ferris wheel.

Let's analyze the positions shown in the options:

- Option (A): Jim is at the top.
- Option (B): Jim is moving downward from the top.
- Option (C): Jim is moving upward toward the top.
- Option (D): Jim is moving downward from the top.
- Option (E): Jim is moving upward toward the top.

Given that Ben is in the position where Jim was beforehand, we can deduce that Jim has moved to the next position, which is moving downward from the top.

Option (B) shows Jim moving downward from the top, which aligns with the circular motion of the Ferris wheel when Ben moves to the position where Jim was previously.

Reasoning: Ben is now in Jim's previous position, so Jim must have moved to the next position in the Ferris wheel's rotation. The correct position for Jim is moving downward from the top, as shown in option (B).

Answer: B).
