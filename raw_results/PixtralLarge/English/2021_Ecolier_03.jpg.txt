To solve this problem, we need to first understand the puzzle pieces and the calculation they form when put together correctly. The image shows four puzzle pieces with numbers 3, 2, 1, and a plus sign.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the numbers and operators on the puzzle pieces:
   - Piece 1: Number 3
   - Piece 2: Number 2
   - Piece 3: Number 1
   - Piece 4: Plus sign (+)

2. Arrange the pieces to form a valid mathematical expression. The only logical arrangement is:
   - 3 * 2 + 1

3. Perform the calculation step-by-step:
   - First, multiply 3 by 2:
     3 * 2 = 6
   - Then, add 1 to the result:
     6 + 1 = 7

4. The result of the calculation is 7.

Reasoning: When the four puzzle pieces are put together correctly, they form the calculation "3 * 2 + 1", which equals 7.
Answer: D).
