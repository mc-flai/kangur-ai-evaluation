**Reasoning**: 
1. The problem states that a kangaroo laid out 3 sticks without breaking or bending them.
2. We need to identify a shape where all sticks are used and none are broken or bent.
3. Let's examine each option:
   - (A) shows a star shape with six points, using three sticks.
   - (B) shows a figure with what appears to be four points, but it seems to use more than three sticks by overlaying them.
   - (C) shows a square-like shape that uses more than three sticks.
   - (D) shows a shape that requires more than three sticks.
   - (E) shows a star shape that uses exactly three sticks without breaking or bending any.
4. Option (E) is the only shape that uses exactly three sticks and does not involve breaking or bending them.

**Answer**: E)
