**Reasoning**: Diana is adding either 2 or 5 to every whole number from 1 to 9. To find the minimum number of different sums, we need to evaluate all possible sums that can be formed:

- Starting with 1: 1 + 2 = 3, 1 + 5 = 6
- Starting with 2: 2 + 2 = 4, 2 + 5 = 7
- Starting with 3: 3 + 2 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8
- Starting with 4: 4 + 2 = 6, 4 + 5 = 9
- Starting with 5: 5 + 2 = 7, 5 + 5 = 10
- Starting with 6: 6 + 2 = 8, 6 + 5 = 11
- Starting with 7: 7 + 2 = 9, 7 + 5 = 12
- Starting with 8: 8 + 2 = 10, 8 + 5 = 13
- Starting with 9: 9 + 2 = 11, 9 + 5 = 14

Now, let's list all the unique sums:
3, 6, 4, 7, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Counting these, we see there are 12 unique sums. However, since the question asks for the minimum number of different values she can get, we need to consider only the necessary distinct sums if Diana wants to achieve as few different sums as possible.

Given the options, the smallest of them is 5.

**Answer**: A)
