**Reasoning**: The question asks which net cannot form a closed loop on the surface of a cuboid. To determine this, we need to visually inspect each net and imagine how folding each net would affect the continuity of the loop.

- Net (A): The loop appears to be continuous as it can wrap around the cuboid's surface without breaking.
- Net (B): The loop seems continuous as it can wrap around the cuboid's surface without breaking.
- Net (C): The loop does not form a continuous path as there is a clear separation between the segments of the loop.
- Net (D): The loop appears to be continuous as it can wrap around the cuboid's surface without breaking.
- Net (E): The loop seems continuous as it can wrap around the cuboid's surface without breaking.

Hence, net (C) cannot form a closed loop on the surface of the cuboid.

**Answer**: C).
