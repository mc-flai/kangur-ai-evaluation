**Reasoning:** A cube has 12 edges in total. For each side of the cube to have at least one red edge, we need to consider the configuration of the edges. Each face of the cube shares its edges with four other faces. To ensure that each side has at least one red edge, the minimum number of edges that need to be red is the number of faces of the cube, because if each face has one red edge, all faces are covered. A cube has 6 faces. Therefore, the minimum number of red edges required is 6.

**Answer:** E)
