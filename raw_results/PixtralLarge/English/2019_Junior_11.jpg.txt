**Reasoning:**

1. **Extract Known Digits:**
   The visible digits from the image are: 1, 5, 7, 2, 8, 0, 4, 2, 3, 3, 1.

2. **Sum of All Digits:**
   The sum of all digits in the three five-digit numbers is given as 57,263.

3. **Sum of Known Digits:**
   Calculate the sum of the visible digits: 1 + 5 + 7 + 2 + 8 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 36.

4. **Sum of Hidden Digits:**
   Subtract the sum of the visible digits from the total sum: 57,263 - 36 = 57,227.

5. **Possible Combinations:**
   Consider the possible combinations provided in the options:
   - (A) 0, 2 and 2 → Sum = 0 + 2 + 2 = 4
   - (B) 1, 2 and 9 → Sum = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12
   - (C) 2, 4 and 9 → Sum = 2 + 4 + 9 = 15
   - (D) 2, 7 and 8 → Sum = 2 + 7 + 8 = 17
   - (E) 5, 7 and 8 → Sum = 5 + 7 + 8 = 20

6. **Matching the Sum:**
   The total sum of the hidden digits should match the sum of the digits from one of the given options.
   - The sum of hidden digits calculated is 57,227, but here we misinterpreted the step. Actually, we need to check each option by hiding the respective digits and see if the sum matches.

   Let's verify by hiding each option's digits one by one:
   - Option A: Hide 0, 2, 2 → Sum of remaining digits: 57,263 - (0 + 2 + 2) = 57,259 → Incorrect
   - Option B: Hide 1, 2, 9 → Sum of remaining digits: 57,263 - (1 + 2 + 9) = 57,251 → Incorrect
   - Option C: Hide 2, 4, 9 → Sum of remaining digits: 57,263 - (2 + 4 + 9) = 57,248 → Incorrect
   - Option D: Hide 2, 7, 8 → Sum of remaining digits: 57,263 - (2 + 7 + 8) = 57,246 → Incorrect
   - Option E: Hide 5, 7, 8 → Sum of remaining digits: 57,263 - (5 + 7 + 8) = 57,243 → Correct

**Answer:** E)
