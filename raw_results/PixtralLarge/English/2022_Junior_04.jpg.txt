To solve question 4, we need to identify how many symbols on the left side of the paper are now congruent on top of a symbol on the right side.

**Reasoning**:
1. The diagram shows a grid with symbols on both sides of a vertical line.
2. The teacher folds the left side along the vertical line to the right.
3. Upon folding, we need to count the number of symbols that are now on top of a symbol from the opposite side.
4. From the diagram:
   - The circle on the left aligns with the circle on the right.
   - The triangle on the left aligns with the triangle on the right.
   - The square on the left aligns with the square on the right.
   - The arrows on the left align with the arrows on the right.
   This gives us a total of 4 symbols that are congruent.

**Answer**: D)
