To determine the number written in the hexagon with the question mark, we need to use the rule that the sums of the three numbers in three hexagons with a common bold point are always equal.

1. Let's denote the hexagons as follows:
   - Hexagon 1 (4)
   - Hexagon 2 (?)
   - Hexagon 3 (11)
   - Hexagon 4 (b)
   - Hexagon 5 (left of 11)
   - Hexagon 6 (right of 11)

2. We know the sums of the numbers in three hexagons with a common bold point are equal. Consider the common bold point between Hexagon 1, Hexagon 4, and Hexagon 5.

   Sum 1 = 4 + b + (number in Hexagon 5)

3. Now consider the common bold point between Hexagon 2, Hexagon 4, and Hexagon 6.

   Sum 2 = ? + b + (number in Hexagon 6)

4. Since Sum 1 = Sum 2, we have:
   4 + b + (number in Hexagon 5) = ? + b + (number in Hexagon 6)

5. From the image, we can see that one such sum involving Hexagon 3 (11) and Hexagon 6 must also be equal. Let's denote the number in Hexagon 6 as c.

   Sum 3 = 11 + (number in Hexagon 5) + c

6. Since Sum 1 = Sum 3, we have:
   4 + b + (number in Hexagon 5) = 11 + (number in Hexagon 5) + c

7. Simplifying the equation, we get:
   4 + b = 11 + c

8. Since Sum 2 = Sum 3, we have:
   ? + b + c = 11 + (number in Hexagon 5) + c

9. Simplifying the equation, we get:
   ? + b = 11 + (number in Hexagon 5)

10. Since 4 + b = 11 + c and ? + b = 11 + (number in Hexagon 5), we can see that to maintain the equality, ? must be equal to the number in Hexagon 5, which is 4.

Therefore, the number written in the hexagon with the question mark is 4.

Reasoning: By comparing the sums of the numbers in the hexagons with common bold points, we determine that the number in the hexagon with the question mark must be 4 to maintain the equality.
