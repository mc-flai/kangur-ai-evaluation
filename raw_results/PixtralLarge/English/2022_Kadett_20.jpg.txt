To determine the surface area of one brick, we'll first understand the given information and the reasoning behind it.

**Reasoning:**
- Two identical bricks can be placed side by side in three different ways, resulting in cuboids with surface areas of 72 cm², 96 cm², and 102 cm².
- When two identical bricks are placed side by side, some of their faces combine to form larger shared faces, reducing the total surface area compared to two individual bricks.
- When the surface areas of the resulting cuboids are given, the calculation involves subtracting the areas of the shared faces and then dividing by 2 (since there are two bricks).

Let's denote the surface area of one brick as S.

1. For the cuboid with a surface area of 72 cm²:
   \[
   2S - 2A = 72 \quad (1)
   \]
   where \( A \) is the area of the shared face.

2. For the cuboid with a surface area of 96 cm²:
   \[
   2S - 2B = 96 \quad (2)
   \]
   where \( B \) is the area of the shared face.

3. For the cuboid with a surface area of 102 cm²:
   \[
   2S - 2C = 102 \quad (3)
   \]
   where \( C \) is the area of the shared face.

We need to determine the values of \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \). By solving equations (1), (2), and (3) using trial and error or substitution, we can find the values of \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).

Given the options, we can infer:

- If \( 2S = 108 \), then \( S = 54 \).
- This matches the condition where the surface area of one brick is 54 cm², fitting the provided information.

**Answer:** D) 54
