To determine the maximum number of points that the team with the most points could have gained in this tournament, we need to consider the following:

1. **Total Points**: There are 61 points in total.
2. **Number of Teams**: There are 8 teams.
3. **Points per Game**: A win gives 3 points, a draw gives 1 point to both teams, and a loss gives 0 points.
4. **Number of Games**: Each team plays every other team exactly once. With 8 teams, each team plays 7 games (since there are 7 other teams), resulting in a total of \( \frac{8 \times 7}{2} = 28 \) games in the tournament.

To find the maximum points a single team could have, consider the scenario where one team wins all its matches:

- If a team wins all 7 of its matches, it would earn \( 7 \times 3 = 21 \) points.

Next, we need to check if it is possible for a team to earn more than 21 points:
- Even if there were draws, the maximum points any team could earn would still be limited by the number of matches it plays.
- Since each team plays 7 matches and the maximum points per win is 3, the theoretical maximum points a team can earn is 21.

Thus, the maximum number of points that the team with the most points could have gained is 21.

Reasoning: The maximum number of points any team can earn is calculated by considering the maximum points per game (3 points for a win) and the number of games each team plays (7 games). This gives a maximum of \( 7 \times 3 = 21 \) points.
