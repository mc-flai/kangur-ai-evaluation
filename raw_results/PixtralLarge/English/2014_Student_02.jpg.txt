To determine the next sum of Carmen, Gerda, and Sabine's ages when it is a two-digit number with two equal digits, we start with the current sum of their ages, which is 44.

1. The next sum of their ages will be reached by adding 1 to each of their ages, which means adding 3 to the total sum.
   Therefore, the next sum will be 44 + 3 = 47.
2. The next number after 47 that is a two-digit number with two equal digits is 55.
3. After 55, the next such number is 66.
4. Continuing this pattern, the next number after 66 is 77.
5. After 77, the next number is 88.
6. Finally, after 88, the next number is 99.

Since we need the next sum after 44, the first two-digit number with two equal digits after 44 is 55.

Reasoning: Therefore, the next sum of their ages that is a two-digit number with two equal digits is 55.
Answer: A).
