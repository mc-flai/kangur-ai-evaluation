To solve question 5, we need to determine the minimum number of bridges that must be closed to reduce the traffic between islands A and B to half.

**Reasoning**:
1. First, we need to understand the structure of the network connecting the 10 islands with 12 bridges.
2. Identify the critical bridges that, when closed, will most effectively reduce the traffic between islands A and B.
3. Since the question asks for the traffic to be cut to half, we need to find a set of bridges whose closure will reduce the number of paths between A and B by half.
4. By analyzing the diagram, we can see that there are multiple paths connecting A and B. Closing one bridge will not be sufficient as there are alternative routes.
5. We need to close multiple bridges strategically to disrupt the connectivity significantly.
6. By examining the paths and counting the bridges, we can determine that closing 3 specific bridges will reduce the traffic between A and B to half.

**Answer**: C)

By closing 3 bridges strategically, we can reduce the traffic between islands A and B to half.
