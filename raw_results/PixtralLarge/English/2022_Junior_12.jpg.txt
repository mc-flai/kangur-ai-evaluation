**Reasoning**: 

- Start with 2022 tiles.
- Adam removes every sixth tile: 
  Number of tiles removed by Adam = 2022 / 6 = 337 tiles removed.
  Remaining tiles after Adam = 2022 - 337 = 1685 tiles.
- Beate removes every fifth of the remaining tiles:
  Number of tiles removed by Beate = 1685 / 5 = 337 tiles removed.
  Remaining tiles after Beate = 1685 - 337 = 1348 tiles.
- Cora removes every fourth of the remaining tiles:
  Number of tiles removed by Cora = 1348 / 4 = 337 tiles removed.
  Remaining tiles after Cora = 1348 - 337 = 1011 tiles.
