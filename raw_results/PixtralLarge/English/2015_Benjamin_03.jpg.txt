To determine the minimum number of squares Sam must paint over so that no two adjacent squares share the same color, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify Adjacent Squares**:
    - The squares adjacent to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

2. **Current Coloring**:
    - Let's label the 9 squares in rows and columns for easier reference.

```
    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9
```

    - Observing the colors:
        - 1 is white.
        - 2 is grey.
        - 3 is black.
        - 4 is black.
        - 5 is grey.
        - 6 is white.
        - 7 is white.
        - 8 is black.
        - 9 is grey.

3. **Check for Adjacent Squares with Same Color**:
    - (1, 4) are adjacent vertically (white, black).
    - (1, 2) are adjacent horizontally (white, grey).
    - (2, 5) are adjacent vertically (grey, grey).
    - (2, 3) are adjacent horizontally (grey, black).
    - (3, 6) are adjacent vertically (black, white).
    - (4, 7) are adjacent vertically (black, white).
    - (4, 5) are adjacent horizontally (black, grey).
    - (5, 8) are adjacent vertically (grey, black).
    - (6, 9) are adjacent vertically (white, grey).
    - (7, 8) are adjacent horizontally (white, black).
    - (8, 9) are adjacent horizontally (black, grey).

4. **Identify Pairs Needing Change**:
    - The pairs (2, 5) and (5, 8) involve the square 5, which is grey.
    - (6, 9) are adjacent vertically (white, grey).

5. **Minimum Changes**:
    - Changing square 5 will solve the problem with (2, 5) and (5, 8).
    - Changing square 6 will solve the problem with (6, 9).
    - Changing square 9 will solve the problem with (6, 9).

6. **Optimal Strategy**:
    - If we change squares 5 and 6, we ensure no two adjacent squares share the same color.

Therefore, the minimum number of squares Sam must paint over is 2.

**Reasoning**: By identifying adjacent pairs with the same color and determining the minimal set of changes, we find that changing two squares (5 and 6) is sufficient.

**Answer**: A).
