To solve this problem, we need to identify which piece of wire, when duplicated and joined by its ends, will form a closed piece without any crosses. This means the wire should form a simple loop without intersections.

1. **Option A**: This piece of wire, when duplicated and joined, will intersect itself because it has a complex shape that will cause overlaps.
2. **Option B**: This piece of wire will form a simple straight line when duplicated and won't form a closed piece.
3. **Option C**: This piece, when duplicated and joined, will form a closed piece without crosses. It forms a simple loop.
4. **Option D**: This piece, when duplicated and joined, will intersect itself due to its shape.
5. **Option E**: This piece, when duplicated and joined, will intersect itself because of its complexity.

Reasoning: Option C is the only piece that forms a simple loop without intersections when duplicated and joined by its ends.

Answer: C).
