To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the proportions of the three triangles based on the grid and the given line passing through point P.

1. **Identify the triangles**:
   - The three triangles are formed by the line intersecting the grid lines.
   - The triangles appear to be similar since the angles are the same for each triangle.

2. **Determine the side ratios**:
   - The smallest triangle has sides that are 1 unit long.
   - The medium triangle has sides that are 2 units long.
   - The largest triangle has sides that are 3 units long.

3. **Calculate the area ratios**:
   - The area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its side lengths.
   - Therefore, the area ratios of the triangles will be the squares of the side lengths: 
     - Smallest triangle area: \(1^2 = 1\)
     - Medium triangle area: \(2^2 = 4\)
     - Largest triangle area: \(3^2 = 9\)

4. **Match the area ratios to the given options**:
   - The area ratios are \(1 : 4 : 9\).

Reasoning: The area ratios of the triangles are proportional to \(1 : 4 : 9\) because the areas of similar triangles are proportional to the squares of their corresponding side lengths.
