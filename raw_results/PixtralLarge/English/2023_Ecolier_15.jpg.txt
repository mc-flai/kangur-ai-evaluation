To determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the circles in the diagram such that no two connected circles share the same color, we need to analyze the graph. The diagram is a pentagon with all vertices connected, forming what is known as a complete graph \( K_5 \).

In graph theory, a complete graph \( K_n \) requires \( n \) colors because each vertex is connected to every other vertex. For \( K_5 \), this means we need 5 different colors to ensure that no two adjacent vertices (circles) have the same color.

**Reasoning**: The diagram is a complete graph \( K_5 \), which requires 5 colors to ensure that no two connected circles have the same color.

**Answer**: D).
