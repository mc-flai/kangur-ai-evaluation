**Reasoning**: To determine which square has the biggest proportion of black area, we need to analyze each option.

- **Option A**: The square is divided into four equal parts with two black and two white sections. Therefore, the proportion of black area is 2/4 = 0.5 or 50%.
- **Option B**: The square is divided into nine equal parts with four black and five white sections. Therefore, the proportion of black area is 4/9 ≈ 0.44 or 44%.
- **Option C**: The square is divided into sixteen equal parts with eight black and eight white sections. Therefore, the proportion of black area is 8/16 = 0.5 or 50%.
- **Option D**: The square is divided into sixteen equal parts with nine black and seven white sections. Therefore, the proportion of black area is 9/16 ≈ 0.56 or 56%.
- **Option E**: The square is divided into sixteen equal parts with eight black and eight white sections. Therefore, the proportion of black area is 8/16 = 0.5 or 50%.

Comparing the proportions, Option D has the highest proportion of black area at approximately 56%.

**Answer**: D).
