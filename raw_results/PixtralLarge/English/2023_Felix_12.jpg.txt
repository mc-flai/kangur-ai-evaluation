To determine which picture Elvis can make with his 6 triangles, we need to analyze the pattern and compare it with the given options.

**Reasoning**:
1. The pattern of each triangle is a right triangle with a smaller triangle cut out.
2. Elvis has 6 identical triangles.
3. We need to find which of the options (A, B, C, D, E) can be made by arranging these 6 triangles.
4. Option (A) shows a hexagon with 6 triangles and additional lines that match the cut-out pattern.
5. Option (B) does not match the cut-out pattern and has extra triangles inside.
6. Option (C) has a similar cut-out pattern but does not fit the arrangement of 6 triangles.
7. Option (D) has the correct number of triangles but the cut-out pattern is different.
8. Option (E) matches the cut-out pattern and the arrangement of 6 triangles correctly.

**Answer**: E).
