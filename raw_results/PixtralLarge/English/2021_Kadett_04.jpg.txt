To determine how many four-digit numbers have the property that their digits, from left to right, are consecutive and in ascending order, we need to analyze the possible sets of digits.

1. Identify the range of digits:
   - The digits must be consecutive and in ascending order.
   - The smallest possible digit is 1, and the largest digit can be up to 9.
   - There must be exactly four digits.

2. Determine the possible sets of four consecutive digits:
   - The smallest set is 1, 2, 3, 4.
   - The next possible set is 2, 3, 4, 5.
   - Continuing this pattern, the next sets are 3, 4, 5, 6; 4, 5, 6, 7; and so on.
   - The largest possible set is 6, 7, 8, 9, since 7, 8, 9, 10 is not a valid four-digit number.

3. Count the number of valid sets:
   - The sets are: 1234, 2345, 3456, 4567, 5678, 6789.
   - There are 6 such sets.

Reasoning: By identifying the possible sets of four consecutive digits in ascending order, we find that there are 6 valid sets.

Answer: B).
