To determine the sum of all interior angles of the polygon described in question 28, we need to consider the number of sides of the polygon.

In any polygon, each vertex is formed by the intersection of two sides, and the number of sides is equal to the number of vertices. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides (or vertices) is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ \]

From the diagram, we can count the number of vertices. The polygon has 8 vertices.

Substitute \( n = 8 \) into the formula:

\[ \text{Sum of interior angles} = (8 - 2) \times 180^\circ \]
\[ \text{Sum of interior angles} = 6 \times 180^\circ \]
\[ \text{Sum of interior angles} = 1080^\circ \]

Reasoning: The polygon in the diagram has 8 vertices. Using the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon, we calculated the sum to be \( 1080^\circ \).

Answer: B).
