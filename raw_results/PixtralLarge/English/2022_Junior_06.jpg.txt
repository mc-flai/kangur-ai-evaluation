**Reasoning**: Let's denote the number as \( x \). According to the problem, we have two conditions:

1. \( x \) is smaller than its half: \( x < \frac{x}{2} \)
2. \( x \) is bigger than its double: \( x > 2x \)

The second condition simplifies to \( x > 2x \), which is always false for any positive \( x \), as \( x \) cannot be greater than \( 2x \). This indicates that \( x \) must be negative.

Additionally, the sum of \( x \) and its square is zero: \( x + x^2 = 0 \). This can be written as the quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 + x = 0 \]

Factoring out \( x \), we get:
\[ x(x + 1) = 0 \]

This gives us two solutions:
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1 \]

However, since \( x \) must be negative (from the condition \( x > 2x \)), the only valid solution is \( x = -1 \).

**Answer**: B)
