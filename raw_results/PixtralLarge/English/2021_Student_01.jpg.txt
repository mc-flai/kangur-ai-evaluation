**Reasoning**: To solve this problem, we need to match the given weather symbols and their corresponding maximum temperatures with the graphs shown in the options. The temperatures are as follows:
- Friday: -1°C
- Saturday: -4°C
- Sunday: 0°C
- Monday: 0°C
- Tuesday: 3°C
- Wednesday: -3°C
- Thursday: 5°C

By observing the graphs:
- The graph should start at -1°C on Friday, drop to -4°C on Saturday, rise to 0°C on Sunday, stay at 0°C on Monday, rise to 3°C on Tuesday, drop to -3°C on Wednesday, and rise back to 5°C on Thursday.

Graph (A) matches this pattern:
- It starts at -1°C.
- Drops to -4°C.
- Rises to 0°C.
- Stays at 0°C.
- Rises to 3°C.
- Drops to -3°C.
- Rises back to 5°C.

**Answer**: A).
