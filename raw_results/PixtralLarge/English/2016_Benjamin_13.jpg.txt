To determine the number of boys in the class, let's denote the number of boys as B and the number of girls as G. We know the total number of students is 30, so:

G + B = 30

We also know that half the girls share a desk with a boy. This means that the number of girls sharing a desk with a boy is G/2.

Since every boy shares a desk with a girl, the number of boys sharing desks with girls is B.

Since two students share a desk, the number of boys and the number of girls sharing desks with boys must be equal:

G/2 = B

Using the equation G + B = 30, we can substitute B with G/2:

G + G/2 = 30

Combining like terms, we get:

3G/2 = 30

Multiplying both sides by 2/3 to solve for G:

G = 30 * (2/3)

G = 20

Now we can find the number of boys:

B = G/2

B = 20/2

B = 10

Reasoning: We used the given information and algebraic manipulation to find the number of boys in the class.
