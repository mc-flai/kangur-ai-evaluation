**Reasoning**:

1. Let the population of Arnberg 20 years ago be A.
2. Let the population of Berghausen 20 years ago be B.
3. The population of Arnberg has increased by 40%, so the current population of Arnberg is A + 0.40A = 1.40A.
4. The population of Berghausen has increased by 60%, so the current population of Berghausen is B + 0.60B = 1.60B.
5. The combined current population of the two villages has increased by 54%. Therefore, the combined current population is 1.54(A + B).
6. We can set up the equation for the combined current population:
   1.40A + 1.60B = 1.54(A + B).
7. Expanding and simplifying the equation:
   1.40A + 1.60B = 1.54A + 1.54B
   1.60B - 1.54B = 1.54A - 1.40A
   0.06B = 0.14A
   B/A = 0.14/0.06
   B/A = 7/3.

Therefore, the ratio of the populations of the two villages 20 years ago was 3:7.

**Answer**: C).
