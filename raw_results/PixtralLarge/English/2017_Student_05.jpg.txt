To determine which piece does not belong to the same quadratic function, we need to analyze each graph segment and identify any inconsistencies.

1. **Analyze the segments**:
    - (A) shows a segment from x=1 to x=2 with a positive slope.
    - (B) shows a segment from x=-2 to x=-1 with a negative slope.
    - (C) shows a segment from x=3 to x=4 with a negative slope.
    - (D) shows a segment from x=-2 to x=-1 with a positive slope.
    - (E) shows a segment from x=-4 to x=-3 with a positive slope.

2. **Quadratic function properties**:
    - A quadratic function is continuous and smooth, meaning its graph should follow a parabolic shape consistently.
    - The slope of the tangent line to the curve should change smoothly.

3. **Identify inconsistencies**:
    - Segments (A), (C), (D), and (E) show consistent slopes with the expected parabolic behavior.
    - Segment (B) has a negative slope from x=-2 to x=-1, which is unusual if we expect a consistent parabolic shape. This segment does not align with the general behavior of a quadratic function.

**Reasoning**: Segment (B) does not fit the expected behavior of a quadratic function due to its inconsistent slope in comparison to the other segments.

**Answer**: B).
