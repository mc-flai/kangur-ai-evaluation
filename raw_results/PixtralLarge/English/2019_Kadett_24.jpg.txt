To determine which net of a cube corresponds to the scenario described in question 24, we need to consider the continuous path the ant crawls along the surface of the cube until it reaches its starting point. This path must be a closed loop on the cube's surface.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Option A**: The path is not a closed loop that returns to the starting point. It starts at one point and ends at another.
2. **Option B**: The path forms a closed loop, but the path does not traverse across all the faces correctly to return to the starting point as a single continuous line.
3. **Option C**: The path is a closed loop, but it does not return to the starting point correctly.
4. **Option D**: The path is a continuous closed loop that starts and ends at the same point, making it the correct option.
5. **Option E**: The path is not a closed loop as it does not return to the starting point continuously.

Based on the above analysis, option D represents the path that forms a continuous closed loop on the surface of the cube, fulfilling the condition described in the problem.

**Answer:** D)
