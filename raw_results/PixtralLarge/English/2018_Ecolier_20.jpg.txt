To determine which symbol stands for the digit 3, we need to analyze the given equations and the corresponding symbols.

1. The first equation:
   Symbol for atom + Symbol for atom = Symbol for fish
   This can be interpreted as: 1 + 1 = 2
   Therefore, the symbol for atom = 1 and the symbol for fish = 2.

2. The second equation:
   Symbol for sun + Symbol for sun = Symbol for atom
   This can be interpreted as: 2 + 2 = 4
   Therefore, the symbol for sun = 2 and the symbol for atom = 1 (confirming the previous finding).

3. The third equation:
   Symbol for sun + Symbol for eye = Symbol for parallel lines
   This can be interpreted as: 2 + 1 = 3
   Therefore, the symbol for eye = 1 and the symbol for parallel lines = 3.

From the above analysis, we can conclude that the symbol for the digit 3 is the symbol for parallel lines.

Reasoning: The given equations help to map each symbol to a digit. By solving these equations step-by-step, we find that the symbol for parallel lines represents the digit 3.
