**Reasoning**:
1. Consider the white triangles: the sum of the numbers in the corner points of each white triangle must be divisible by 3.
2. We know that three of the points are already labeled as 0, 0, and 2. Let's denote the inner point by \( x \).
3. The sum of the corner points in the white triangle which includes the point labeled 0, the point labeled 0, and the inner point \( x \) must be divisible by 3. Therefore, \( 0 + 0 + x \equiv x \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \).
4. This means \( x \) must be divisible by 3. The possible values for \( x \) are 0, 1, or 2. Among these, only 0 is divisible by 3.
5. Therefore, the inner point can only be labeled 0.

**Answer**: A).
