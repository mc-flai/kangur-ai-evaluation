**Reasoning**:
- The ages of the six sisters are consecutive integers.
- Let the ages of the sisters be \( x, x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4, x+5 \).
- The sum of these six ages is \( x + (x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) + (x+4) + (x+5) \).
- Simplifying the sum, we get \( 6x + (1+2+3+4+5) = 6x + 15 \).
- Since \( 6x \) is a multiple of 6 and 15 is a constant, \( 6x + 15 \) will always be divisible by 3.
- To determine which number cannot be the sum of the six ages, we need to check which of the given options is not divisible by 3.
- Checking the options:
  - 95: \( 95 \div 3 \approx 31.67 \) (not divisible by 3)
  - 125: \( 125 \div 3 \approx 41.67 \) (not divisible by 3)
  - 167: \( 167 \div 3 \approx 55.67 \) (not divisible by 3)
  - 205: \( 205 \div 3 \approx 68.33 \) (not divisible by 3)
  - 233: \( 233 \div 3 \approx 77.67 \) (not divisible by 3)
- Since the sum of the ages must be divisible by 3, we need to exclude the options that are not divisible by 3.
- All the options listed are not divisible by 3. However, since we need to find the one that cannot be the sum, we should focus on the largest number given the context of the problem.
- The largest number, 233, cannot be the sum of the six ages since it is not divisible by 3 and is an outlier in terms of being the highest non-divisible number.
