**Reasoning**:
1. Let's denote the total number of participants as \( T \).
2. We are given that 35% of the participants are female. Therefore, 65% of the participants are male.
3. We are also told that there are 252 more male participants than female participants.

Let's denote the number of female participants as \( F \).
Then the number of male participants will be \( F + 252 \).

Since 35% of the participants are female, we have:
\[ F = 0.35T \]

Since 65% of the participants are male, we have:
\[ F + 252 = 0.65T \]

Substituting \( F = 0.35T \) into the equation for the males, we get:
\[ 0.35T + 252 = 0.65T \]

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ 252 = 0.65T - 0.35T \]
\[ 252 = 0.3T \]

Solving for \( T \), we get:
\[ T = \frac{252}{0.3} \]
\[ T = 840 \]

Therefore, the total number of participants is 840.
