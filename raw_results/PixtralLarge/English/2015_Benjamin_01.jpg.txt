**Reasoning**: The question asks which shape has exactly one half colored grey. We need to look for a shape where precisely 50% of its area is grey.

- (A) The circle is divided into three equal parts, and one of those parts is grey. This means the grey area is one-third of the circle, not one half.
- (B) The triangle is divided into two equal parts, and one of those parts is grey. This means the grey area is exactly one half of the triangle.
- (C) The square is divided into four equal parts, and two of those parts are grey. This means the grey area is one half of the square.
- (D) The square is divided into two equal parts, and one of those parts is grey. This means the grey area is exactly one half of the square.
- (E) The pentagon is divided into five equal parts, and one of those parts is grey. This means the grey area is one-fifth of the pentagon, not one half.

Both options C and D have exactly one half colored grey, but since we need to choose the one that fits exactly one half, option B is the correct choice because it's the only one divided into exactly two parts.

**Answer**: B).
