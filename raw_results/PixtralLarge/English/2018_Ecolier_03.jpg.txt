**Reasoning**:
1. Observe the diagram carefully to identify the screws that are equally long.
2. From the image, it can be seen that screws 2, 3, 4, and 5 appear to be the same length.
3. Screw 1 is visibly shorter than the others.
4. Since the question asks for the shorter screw, we need to identify it correctly.
5. Based on the visual comparison, screw 1 is shorter than the rest.

**Answer**: A).
