**Reasoning**: To determine the minimum amount of water that needs to be used before all digits on the water meter are different, we need to find the smallest amount of water that would make all the digits in the meter display different numbers.

The current display is 91876 m続. To make all digits different, the first digit (9) needs to change. The smallest number it can change to that hasn't been used yet is 0. The second digit is 1, which is already unique. The third digit is 8, which is unique as well. The fourth digit is 7, which is also unique. The fifth digit is 6, which is unique too.

So, if the first digit (9) changes to 0, we will have 01876 m続. This makes all digits unique. The smallest amount of water that needs to be used to make this change is 0.001 m続 (from 91876 to 91877), but since we need to ensure all digits are different, we need to consider the smallest non-used digit increment that would achieve this. The smallest non-used digit increment in this scenario would be 0.137 m続.

**Answer**: D)
