To analyze question 17, we need to identify which net can represent a closed path on the surface of a cuboid. A closed path on a cuboid must start and end at the same point and traverse along the faces of the cuboid.

Let's examine each option:

- **A)** The path is not closed; it starts and ends at different points.
- **B)** The path is not closed; it starts and ends at different points.
- **C)** The path is closed; it starts and ends at the same point and forms a continuous loop.
- **D)** The path is not closed; it starts and ends at different points.
- **E)** The path is not closed; it starts and ends at different points.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

Reasoning: The path in option C is the only one that forms a closed loop on the surface of a cuboid.
Answer: C).
