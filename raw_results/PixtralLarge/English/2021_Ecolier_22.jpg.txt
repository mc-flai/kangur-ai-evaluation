**Reasoning**:
1. Let's denote the weights of the boxes as follows:
   - Box 1: 7 kg
   - Box 2: 5 kg
   - Box 3: 6 kg
   - Box 4: 2 kg
   - Box 5: 16 kg

2. The total weight of all the bananas is 3 times the total weight of all the apples.

3. Let the total weight of all apples be \( A \). Then the total weight of all bananas is \( 3A \).

4. The total weight of all boxes is:
   \[
   7 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 16 = 36 \text{ kg}
   \]

5. Since the total weight of bananas plus the total weight of apples equals 36 kg:
   \[
   A + 3A = 36 \text{ kg}
   \]
   \[
   4A = 36 \text{ kg}
   \]
   \[
   A = 9 \text{ kg}
   \]

6. Therefore, the total weight of apples is 9 kg, and the total weight of bananas is 27 kg.

7. Now, we need to determine which boxes contain apples such that the sum of their weights is 9 kg.

8. Checking combinations:
   - \( 7 + 2 = 9 \) (boxes 1 and 4)
   - \( 5 + 2 + 2 \) is not possible (weight 2 only appears once)
   - \( 6 + 3 \) is not possible (weight 3 does not appear)
   - \( 16 + (-7) \) is not possible (weight must be positive)

9. Therefore, boxes 1 (7 kg) and 4 (2 kg) contain apples.

**Answer**: E) 1 and 4.
