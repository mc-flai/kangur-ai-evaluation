To determine the maximum number of marbles in the bag, we need to consider the given conditions:

1. If one randomly takes out five marbles, there is at least one red one.
2. If one randomly takes out six marbles, there is at least one green one.

Let's denote the number of red marbles as \( R \) and the number of green marbles as \( G \).

From the first condition, taking out five marbles must include at least one red marble. Therefore, the number of green marbles \( G \) must be at most 4 (since if there were 5 or more green marbles, it would be possible to take out five green marbles without any red ones).

From the second condition, taking out six marbles must include at least one green marble. Therefore, the number of red marbles \( R \) must be at most 5 (since if there were 6 or more red marbles, it would be possible to take out six red marbles without any green ones).

Thus, we have:
\[ G \leq 4 \]
\[ R \leq 5 \]

The maximum number of marbles in the bag is the sum of the maximum number of red and green marbles:
\[ R + G \leq 5 + 4 = 9 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of marbles in the bag is 9.

Reasoning: By analyzing the conditions and determining the maximum possible number of red and green marbles, we find that the total number of marbles cannot exceed 9.
