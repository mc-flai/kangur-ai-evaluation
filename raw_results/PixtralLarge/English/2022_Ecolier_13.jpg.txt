To determine the total number of children in the class, we need to analyze the arrangement described in the problem.

1. **Determine the number of children in Robert’s row**:
   - Robert has 2 children to his left and 3 children to his right.
   - Including Robert, there are 2 (left) + 1 (Robert) + 3 (right) = 6 children in his row.

2. **Determine the number of rows**:
   - There are 2 rows in front of Robert and 1 row behind Robert.
   - Including Robert’s row, there are 2 (in front) + 1 (Robert’s row) + 1 (behind) = 4 rows in total.

3. **Calculate the total number of children**:
   - Since each row has the same number of children, and each row has 6 children:
   - The total number of children is 4 (rows) * 6 (children per row) = 24 children.

Reasoning: The calculation is based on the arrangement of children in rows and the number of rows provided in the problem.
