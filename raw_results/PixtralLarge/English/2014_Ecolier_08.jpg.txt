**Reasoning**: The question asks which square can be swapped with the question mark such that the white area and the black area are the same size. Observing the pattern in the grid, we see that each square is divided diagonally into two equal triangles, one white and one black. 

For the white and black areas to be equal in the entire grid, each individual square must follow this pattern. Looking at the options:

- (A) has a fully white square.
- (B) has a fully black square.
- (C) has one white and one black triangle.
- (D) has one white and one black triangle.
- (E) has one white and one black triangle.

Both (C) and (E) have a white and black triangle, but to fit into the grid, the orientation matters. The grid has a specific orientation of black and white triangles. To match this, the square must have the black triangle on the bottom left and the white triangle on the top right. This matches option (E).

**Answer**: E).
