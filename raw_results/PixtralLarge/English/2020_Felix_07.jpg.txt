**Reasoning**:
1. The block in the image is composed of smaller cubes.
2. The visible cubes are arranged in a 3x3x3 cube configuration.
3. The front face of the cube shows 3 white cubes and 6 colored cubes.
4. Since the white cubes and colored cubes are in equal amounts, there are 9 white cubes in total.
5. The visible white cubes are 3 on the front face, 1 on the top face (middle of the second row), and 1 on the side face (middle of the second row).
6. Thus, the number of visible white cubes is 5.
7. The total number of white cubes is 9, so the number of white cubes that cannot be seen is 9 - 5 = 4.
