To determine who the tallest brother is, let's analyze the claims one by one.

1. **Claim by A**: "I am neither the tallest nor the smallest."
   - If A is neither the tallest nor the smallest, it implies there are two people taller than A and one person smaller than A (or vice versa).

2. **Claim by B**: "I am not the smallest."
   - This means B could be either the tallest or of middle height.

3. **Claim by C**: "I am the tallest."
   - If C is the tallest, then A, B, and D must be shorter than C.

4. **Claim by D**: "I am the smallest."
   - If D is the smallest, then A, B, and C must be taller than D.

Given that exactly one of them lies, let's consider the implications of each claim being true or false:

- If A is telling the truth, then A is neither the tallest nor the smallest. This leaves the possibilities of C being the tallest and D being the smallest.

- If B is telling the truth, then B is not the smallest. This aligns with D being the smallest, but does not give us definitive information about who is the tallest.

- If C is telling the truth, then C is the tallest. This aligns with A's claim of not being the tallest or smallest, and D's claim of being the smallest.

- If D is telling the truth, then D is the smallest. This aligns with C being the tallest and B not being the smallest.

Given that only one person is lying, and C's claim aligns with all other truthful statements, it implies that C is indeed the tallest.

Reasoning: By analyzing the claims and the condition that exactly one person lies, we can deduce that C is the tallest brother.

Answer: C)
