To determine which digits are on the key with the question mark, we need to analyze the given padlocks and their corresponding keys. Each letter on a padlock represents a digit, and the same letters mean the same digits.

Here are the given padlocks and keys:
- DAD: 184
- BHD: 124
- ABD: 382
- AHD: 284
- HAB: 823

We need to find the digits for the key corresponding to the padlock with the question mark.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. From DAD = 184:
   - D = 1
   - A = 8
   - D = 4 (This creates a contradiction because D cannot be both 1 and 4. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate this step.)

2. From BHD = 124:
   - B = 1
   - H = 2
   - D = 4

3. From ABD = 382:
   - A = 3
   - B = 8
   - D = 2 (This creates a contradiction because B cannot be both 1 and 8. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate this step.)

4. From AHD = 284:
   - A = 2
   - H = 8
   - D = 4

5. From HAB = 823:
   - H = 8
   - A = 2
   - B = 3

Consolidating the correct mappings:
- D = 4
- B = 1
- H = 2
- A = 8

Now, let's find the digits for the key with the question mark. The padlock with the question mark is not provided directly, but we can infer it by checking the consistency of the mappings.

Since we have:
- D = 4
- B = 1
- H = 2
- A = 8

The key with the question mark should match these digits. The only option that fits these mappings is:
- Option D: 823

**Reasoning:**
By analyzing the given padlocks and their corresponding keys, we determined the correct digit mappings. The key with the question mark should have the digits 823.

**Answer: D)**
