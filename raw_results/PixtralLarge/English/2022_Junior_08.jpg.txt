**Reasoning**:
The diagram for the previous week shows four different apps with varying usage times represented by bars of different lengths. For the current week, Sonja has spent half the amount of time using two of the apps and the same amount of time as last week using the other two apps.

In the diagram for the previous week, there are two longer bars and two shorter bars. For the current week, the correct diagram must show two bars halved in length (representing half the time of the longer bars) and two bars of the same length (representing the same time as the shorter bars).

Upon inspecting the options:
- A) Two shorter bars and two halved bars.
- B) Two halved bars and two longer bars.
- C) All bars are the same length.
- D) Two longer bars, one halved bar, and one shorter bar.
- E) Two halved bars and two bars of different lengths.

The correct diagram should have two bars halved in length and two bars of the same length as the shorter bars from the previous week. This matches option A.

**Answer**: A).
