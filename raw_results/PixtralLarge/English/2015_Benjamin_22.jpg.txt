**Reasoning**:
1. Mike is sitting in the 18th compartment behind the engine, which is in the 3rd carriage. This means the first two carriages must have a total of 18 compartments between them. Since each carriage has the same number of compartments, we can deduce that the total number of compartments in these first two carriages must be 18.
2. Therefore, the number of compartments per carriage can be calculated as 18 compartments / 2 carriages = 9 compartments per carriage.
3. Joanna is sitting in the 50th compartment behind the engine, which is in the 7th carriage. This confirms our calculation because the 50th compartment would be in the 7th carriage if each carriage has 9 compartments (since 6 carriages would have 54 compartments, and the 7th carriage starts from the 55th compartment).

**Answer**: C).
