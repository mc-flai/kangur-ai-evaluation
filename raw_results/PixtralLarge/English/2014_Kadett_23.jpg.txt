To determine the area of the quadrilateral ABCD, we need to use the areas of the triangles provided in the diagram. The quadrilateral can be divided into two triangles: triangle ABC and triangle ACD.

Given:
- Area of triangle ABC = 10
- Area of triangle ABD = 5
- Area of triangle BCD = S
- Area of triangle ACD = T

We need to find the total area of the quadrilateral ABCD.

First, find the area of triangle ACD. Since triangle ACD is composed of triangle ABD and triangle BCD, we have:
T = 5 + S

Next, find the total area of quadrilateral ABCD by adding the areas of triangles ABC and ACD:
Total area of ABCD = Area of triangle ABC + Area of triangle ACD
                 = 10 + T
                 = 10 + (5 + S)
                 = 15 + S

From the options given:
- A) 60
- B) 45
- C) 40
- D) 35
- E) 30

Given the numbers in the diagram:
- Area of triangle ABC = 10
- Area of triangle ABD = 5
- Area of triangle BCD = 15

So, T = 5 + 15 = 20

Total area of ABCD = 10 + 20 = 30

Reasoning: We calculated the area of triangle ACD and added it to the area of triangle ABC to find the total area of the quadrilateral ABCD.

Answer: E)
