To determine how much the Ferris wheel needs to turn so that a white gondola is on top for the first time, we need to analyze the positions of the gondolas in the Ferris wheel.

1. **Observation**: The Ferris wheel has 6 gondolas. When the wheel turns, each gondola moves to the position previously occupied by the next gondola in a counterclockwise direction.
2. **Initial Position**: We identify the position of the white gondola. In the provided image, the white gondola is initially at the bottom position.
3. **Target Position**: We need this white gondola to reach the top position for the first time.
4. **Calculation**: Since there are 6 gondolas, each represents a fraction of the full turn. Moving one position (from one gondola to the next) involves a turn of 1/6 of the wheel. To move from the bottom to the top (3 positions away), the wheel needs to turn 3/6 (or 1/2) of a full turn.

Reasoning: The white gondola needs to move 3 positions to reach the top, which corresponds to 3/6 (1/2) of a full turn.
Answer: A).
