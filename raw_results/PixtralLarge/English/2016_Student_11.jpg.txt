**Reasoning**:
1. We start with the given equation: \( a + 2 = b - 2 = c \times 2 = d + 2 \).
2. To find the relationships between \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \), we can express \( b, c, \) and \( d \) in terms of \( a \):
   - From \( a + 2 = b - 2 \), we get \( b = a + 4 \).
   - From \( a + 2 = c \times 2 \), we get \( c = \frac{a + 2}{2} \).
   - From \( a + 2 = d + 2 \), we get \( d = a \).
3. Now, we compare the values of \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \).
   - \( b = a + 4 \) (which is greater than \( a \))
   - \( c = \frac{a + 2}{2} \) (which is less than \( a \))
   - \( d = a \) (equal to \( a \))
4. Therefore, the largest number among \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) is \( b \).

**Answer**: B)
