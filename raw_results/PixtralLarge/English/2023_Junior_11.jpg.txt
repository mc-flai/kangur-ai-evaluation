To determine the fraction by which Jennifer reduces her water usage for her shower, we need to consider the combined effect of reducing water pressure and reducing shower time.

1. **Reduction in Water Pressure**: Jennifer reduces the water pressure, which reduces water usage by one quarter. Reducing by one quarter means using 25% less water. Therefore, the remaining water usage is 100% - 25% = 75%. In fraction terms, this is 3/4 of the original water usage.

2. **Reduction in Shower Time**: Jennifer also reduces the time she takes a shower by one quarter. This is another 25% reduction. Mathematically, it means she uses 75% of her usual shower time. In fraction terms, this is also 3/4 of the original shower time.

3. **Combined Effect**: To find the combined reduction in water usage, we need to multiply these two fractions together:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{16}
   \]
   This calculation shows that Jennifer now uses 9/16 of the original amount of water for her shower.

4. **Fraction by Which She Reduces Usage**: To find the fraction by which she reduces the water usage, we subtract the new fraction from the original whole (1):
   \[
   1 - \frac{9}{16} = \frac{16}{16} - \frac{9}{16} = \frac{7}{16}
   \]
   So, Jennifer reduces her water usage by 7/16.

**Reasoning**: Jennifer's combined reductions in water pressure and shower time result in using 9/16 of the original amount of water. Therefore, the fraction by which she reduces her water usage is 7/16.

**Answer**: E)
