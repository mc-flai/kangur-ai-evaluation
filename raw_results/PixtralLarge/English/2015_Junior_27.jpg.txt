**Reasoning**: To determine which number was crossed out, we need to calculate the average of the remaining numbers in such a way that it equals 4.75.

The numbers in the list are 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1, n.

Let's denote the total sum of the numbers as S and the number of terms as n. The sum of the first n natural numbers is given by:
\[ S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \]

If one number is crossed out, the remaining sum is S - x, where x is the crossed out number, and the number of terms left is n-1. The average of the remaining numbers is given by:
\[ \frac{S - x}{n - 1} = 4.75 \]

First, we need to find the value of n. Since the average of the remaining numbers is 4.75, we start by approximating n to see which value fits. Let's try some values and solve for x.

For n = 8:
\[ S = \frac{8(8+1)}{2} = 36 \]
\[ \frac{36 - x}{7} = 4.75 \]
\[ 36 - x = 4.75 \times 7 \]
\[ 36 - x = 33.25 \]
\[ x = 36 - 33.25 = 2.75 \]

Since x must be an integer, 2.75 is not valid.

For n = 9:
\[ S = \frac{9(9+1)}{2} = 45 \]
\[ \frac{45 - x}{8} = 4.75 \]
\[ 45 - x = 4.75 \times 8 \]
\[ 45 - x = 38 \]
\[ x = 45 - 38 = 7 \]

Here, x = 7, which is an integer and makes sense.

Thus, the number crossed out is 7.
