To determine which fraction of the circle area is shaded, we need to analyze the given information and the diagram. The problem states that OB is equal to BC, and the shaded area is the segment formed by the chord AB.

1. **Identify the Geometry**: The diagram shows a circle with center O, and the diameters AB and CX. Since OB = BC, triangle OBC is an isosceles triangle with OB and BC being the radii of the circle.

2. **Calculate the Angle**: Since OB = BC, triangle OBC is isosceles, and the angle at O (angle BOC) is divided equally by the radius OB. The total angle around point O is 360 degrees, and since OB and BC are radii, angle BOC is 60 degrees (360 degrees / 6 = 60 degrees).

3. **Determine the Fraction of the Circle**: The shaded area corresponds to the sector formed by angle BOC, which is 60 degrees. The fraction of the circle area that is shaded is the ratio of the central angle of the shaded sector to the total angle in a circle (360 degrees).

4. **Calculate the Fraction**: The fraction of the circle area that is shaded is 60 degrees / 360 degrees = 1/6.

However, none of the given options directly match 1/6. We need to re-evaluate the problem or consider if there might be a mistake in the options provided. Given the options, the closest fraction that could represent a sector of the circle is 1/3, which corresponds to a 120-degree sector.

Reasoning: The shaded area corresponds to a sector of the circle, and the closest fraction to 1/6 (which is the correct calculation) among the given options is 1/3.

Answer: B).
