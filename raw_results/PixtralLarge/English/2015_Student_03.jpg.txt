To solve the equation \(2^{2x} = 4^{x+1}\), we can follow these steps:

1. Express both sides of the equation in terms of the same base. Note that \(2^2 = 4\), so we can rewrite \(4^{x+1}\) as \((2^2)^{x+1}\).

   \(2^{2x} = (2^2)^{x+1}\)

2. Simplify the right side by applying the power of a power rule: \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\).

   \(2^{2x} = 2^{2(x+1)}\)

3. Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other.

   \(2x = 2(x + 1)\)

4. Solve for \(x\):

   \(2x = 2x + 2\)

5. Subtract \(2x\) from both sides:

   \(0 = 2\)

This equation \(0 = 2\) is a contradiction, which implies that there are no real solutions to the original equation.

Therefore, the number of real solutions is:

Reasoning: The equation simplifies to a contradiction, which means there are no real solutions.
