To determine which piece is identical to one of the three pieces that the shape in the picture is to be split into, we need to analyze the given shape and the options provided.

The given shape is a 4x4 grid with one square missing from the upper-right corner. We need to find a piece that can be combined with two other identical pieces to form this shape.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. **Option A**: This is an L-shaped piece. Combining three of these would not form the given shape.
2. **Option B**: This is a T-shaped piece. Combining three of these would not form the given shape.
3. **Option C**: This is a straight vertical line of four squares. Combining three of these would not form the given shape.
4. **Option D**: This is an L-shaped piece similar to A but mirrored. Combining three of these would not form the given shape.
5. **Option E**: This is a cross-shaped piece. Combining three of these can form the given shape with one square missing from the upper-right corner.

By analyzing the options, it is clear that only Option E can be combined with two other identical pieces to form the given shape.

**Reasoning**: The cross-shaped piece (Option E) can be combined with two other identical pieces to form the given shape with one square missing from the upper-right corner.
**Answer**: E).
