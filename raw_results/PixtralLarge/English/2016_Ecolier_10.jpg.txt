To determine the number of different ways the mouse can choose to get outside the labyrinth, we need to analyze the structure of the labyrinth and count the possible paths.

1. **Identify the openings and paths**:
   - The mouse starts from the left side and must pass through each opening at most once.
   - The labyrinth has multiple intersections which determine the possible paths.

2. **Count the different possible paths**:
   - From the start point, the mouse has several initial directions it can take.
   - Each direction leads to further branches and intersections.

3. **Enumerate all paths**:
   - By following each possible path from start to finish, we count each distinct path as a valid way to escape the labyrinth.
   - Ensure no path is counted more than once and that each path adheres to the rule of passing through each opening only once.

Given the structure of the labyrinth provided in the image, there are exactly 6 distinct paths the mouse can take to escape.

**Reasoning**: After carefully counting all the possible paths through the labyrinth, ensuring each path adheres to the rule of passing through each opening at most once, we find there are 6 distinct paths.

**Answer**: D)
