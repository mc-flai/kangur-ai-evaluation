**Reasoning**: 
1. To determine the number of equally sized small triangles that can be made from the shape in Figure 1, we first need to count the number of unit squares that the shape covers.
2. By observing Figure 1, we can see that the shape covers 8 unit squares.
3. Each small triangle, as shown in Figure 2, covers exactly half of a unit square.
4. Therefore, to find the number of small triangles needed, we can use the calculation:
   
   Number of small triangles = 2 * Number of unit squares
   
   Substituting the number of unit squares:
   
   Number of small triangles = 2 * 8 = 16

**Answer**: E)
