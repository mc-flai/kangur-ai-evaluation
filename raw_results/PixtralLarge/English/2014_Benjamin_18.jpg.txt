To solve this problem, we need to identify the face opposite to face 4 on a standard die.

1. **Understanding the die layout**:
   - Faces 1 and 6 are opposite each other.
   - Faces 2 and 5 are opposite each other.
   - Faces 3 and 4 are opposite each other.

2. **Given information**:
   - Faces 1 and 6 have a common edge.
   - Faces 1 and 5 have a common edge.
   - Faces 1 and 2 have a common edge.
   - Faces 6 and 4 have a common edge.
   - Faces 6 and 2 have a common edge.

3. **Determine the opposite face**:
   - Since faces 1 and 6 are opposite each other, face 4 cannot be opposite to face 1 or face 6.
   - Since faces 2 and 5 are opposite each other, face 4 cannot be opposite to face 2 or face 5.
   - Therefore, the only remaining face that can be opposite to face 4 is face 3.

Reasoning: Based on the standard die layout and the given information, the face opposite to face 4 is face 3.
Answer: C)
