To determine which edge labeled with "x" meets when the net is folded up to form an octahedron, we need to visualize how the net folds into the 3D shape. An octahedron has eight equilateral triangular faces.

Let's analyze the given net:

- The net consists of eight triangles labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, x, and two unlabeled triangles.
- When folded into an octahedron, the triangles with the same number will come together.
- The triangles labeled "1" and "5" are adjacent to the triangle labeled "x."

By folding the net, the triangle labeled "x" will fold to meet the triangle labeled "1."

Reasoning: By examining the layout of the net and visualizing the folding process, it is clear that the edge labeled "x" will meet the edge labeled "1" when forming the octahedron.
