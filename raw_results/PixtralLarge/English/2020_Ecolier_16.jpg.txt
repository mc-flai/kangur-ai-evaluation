**Reasoning**: Initially, Ana had twice as much money as each of her friends. This means that together, Bia and Cris had the same amount as Ana. After paying for the movie entrance fees, Ana has three times the amount that Bia and Cris have together.

Let the amount each of Bia and Cris originally had be x reais. Therefore, Ana originally had 2x reais.

After paying the entrance fees, the total amount they had (100 reais) is reduced by three times the entrance fee (3y reais, where y is the entrance fee per person), leaving them with 100 - 3y reais.

According to the problem, Ana now has three times the amount that Bia and Cris have together. Since Bia and Cris each paid y reais for the entrance, they now have (x - y) reais each, and together they have 2(x - y) reais.

So, Ana has 3 * 2(x - y) reais after paying for the entrance, which means:

2x - 3y = 6(x - y)

Solving for y, we get:

2x - 3y = 6x - 6y
4y = 4x
y = x

Since Ana had twice as much as each of her friends initially, the total money they had was 4x reais. They paid 3y reais as the entrance fee, so:

3y = 3x = (3/4) * 100 = 75 reais

So, y = 25 reais.

Therefore, the cost of the entrance fee per person is 25 reais, and the total cost for the three of them is 3 * 25 = 75 reais.

**Answer**: Option not listed in the provided choices, as 75 reais is not among the given options.
