**Reasoning**:
The problem states that in the year 2014, the last digit (4) is bigger than the sum of the three other digits (2+0+1). We need to determine how many years ago this condition last happened.

To find this, we need to look for previous years where the last digit is greater than the sum of the other three digits. Let's look at the years preceding 2014 and check this condition:

- Year: 2013 -> 2 + 0 + 1 < 3 (Condition not satisfied)
- Year: 2012 -> 2 + 0 + 1 < 2 (Condition not satisfied)
- Year: 2011 -> 2 + 0 + 1 < 1 (Condition not satisfied)
- Year: 2010 -> 2 + 0 + 1 > 0 (Condition not satisfied)
- Year: 2009 -> 2 + 0 + 0 < 9 (Condition satisfied)

So, the last time this condition was satisfied was in the year 2009.

The number of years between 2014 and 2009 is 2014 - 2009 = 5 years.
