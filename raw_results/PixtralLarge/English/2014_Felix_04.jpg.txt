**Reasoning**: The problem states that a big square is made from 25 small squares, and a few of those small squares have been lost. The diagram shows a 5x5 grid with some squares missing. By counting the remaining squares in the diagram, we can determine how many squares are left.

Counting the squares in the diagram, we have:
- 3 squares in the top row
- 4 squares in the second row
- 5 squares in the third row
- 4 squares in the fourth row
- 3 squares in the bottom row

Adding these up, we get: 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 19 squares remaining.

Since the original big square had 25 squares, the number of squares lost is: 25 - 19 = 6.

**Answer**: A)
