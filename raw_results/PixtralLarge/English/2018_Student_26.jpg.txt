To analyze question 26, we need to determine the total distance the ball travels starting from point M and reflecting off the sides of the rectangular billiard table. The ball must hit side AB again for the given distances.

1. **Determine the path of the ball**:
    - The ball starts at point M on side AB and first reflects off side BC. The distance from M to BC is 1.2 m.
    - After reflecting off BC, the ball travels a distance of 0.8 m to hit side AD.

2. **Visualize the path using reflections**:
    - Reflect the rectangle across the sides to visualize the ball's straight-line path.
    - The original rectangle is 3 m by 2 m.

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled horizontally and vertically**:
    - Horizontal distance: 1.2 m (distance from M to side BC) + 0.8 m (distance from side BC to side AD).
    - Since the ball reflects exactly once off each side (BC and AD), we need to check if the total horizontal and vertical distances add up to the dimensions of the table.

4. **Check the total distance covered**:
    - Horizontal distance: 1.2 m + 0.8 m = 2 m.
    - Vertical distance: The ball starts on side AB, so it travels 2 m vertically.

5. **Summarize the total distance**:
    - The ball travels a total of 2 m horizontally and 2 m vertically.
    - The Pythagorean theorem can be used to find the straight-line distance: sqrt(2^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(4 + 4) = sqrt(8) = 2√2 ≈ 2.83 m.

Thus, the correct answer is the option that matches this total distance.

Reasoning: The total distance the ball travels, considering the reflections and the dimensions of the table, results in a straight-line distance that approximates to 2.8 m.

Answer: D).
