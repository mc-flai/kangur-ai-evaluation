**Reasoning**: To determine how many spaces will definitely be filled on the game board, consider the following:

1. Hannes places one coin each on eight spaces that lie next to each other.
2. The game board has a total of 11 spaces.
3. If Hannes places the coins in the middle 8 spaces, there will be 3 spaces left (1 on each end and 1 in the middle where it cannot be placed next to any other 8).
4. If Hannes places the coins starting from either end of the board, he will definitely fill 8 spaces.
5. The remaining 3 spaces (either at the beginning or end) will not be filled as they are not next to the sequence of coins.
6. Therefore, regardless of where Hannes starts placing the coins, he will always fill 8 spaces.

Since the question asks for the number of spaces that will definitely be filled, we need to think about the spaces that could potentially be left unfilled. If Hannes places the coins on the first 8 spaces, the last 3 spaces will be left unfilled. Conversely, if he starts from the end, the first 3 spaces will be left unfilled. Therefore, no matter where he starts, he will always fill 8 spaces, and there will always be 3 spaces that remain unfilled.

Thus, the number of spaces that will definitely be filled is 11 - 3 = 8. However, there is a trick: since the problem states that some spaces will definitely be filled, it means that the answer must be the number of spaces that will always be filled regardless of where Hannes starts placing the coins. This implies that the number of spaces that will definitely not be filled is 3, which means the remaining spaces will definitely be filled.

Therefore, the number of spaces that will definitely be filled is 11 - 3 = 8. But the options provided do not include 8, so we need to reconsider the problem. If we analyze the problem again, we realize that no matter where Hannes starts, he will always fill 8 spaces, and there will be 3 spaces left unfilled. This means that the number of spaces that will definitely be filled is not 8, but rather the number of spaces that will definitely not be filled is 3.
