**Reasoning**: 
1. Susi is the 7th from the front. This means there are 6 children in front of her.
2. Kim is the 2nd from the back. With 12 children in total, this means Kim is positioned as the 11th from the front (since 12 - 1 = 11).
3. To find the number of children between Susi and Kim, we need to count the children from Susi's position (7th) to Kim's position (11th). 
4. The children between the 7th and the 11th positions are the 8th, 9th, and 10th children. This gives us 3 children between Susi and Kim.

**Answer**: B)
