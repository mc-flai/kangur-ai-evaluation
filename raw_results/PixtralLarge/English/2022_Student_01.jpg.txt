**Reasoning**: Martin spent half the amount of time using two of the apps and the same amount of time as last week using the other two apps. This means two of the bars in the diagram should be half the length they were in the previous week's diagram, while the other two should remain the same length.

Looking at the given diagram from the previous week, the two longest bars should be halved, and the two shortest bars should remain the same.

Analyzing the options:
- (A) shows all bars at half the length, which is incorrect since two should remain the same.
- (B) shows three bars at half the length and one at the same length, which is incorrect.
- (C) shows two bars at half the length and two at the same length, which is correct.
- (D) shows all bars at the same length as before, which is incorrect.
- (E) shows one bar at half the length and three at the same length, which is incorrect.

**Answer**: C).
