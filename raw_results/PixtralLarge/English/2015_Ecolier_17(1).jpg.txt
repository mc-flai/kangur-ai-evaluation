**Reasoning**:
1. Observe the shape in Figure 1. It is composed of several small triangles identical in size to those shown in Figure 2.
2. Count the number of these small triangles that fit into the larger shape in Figure 1.
3. Notice that Figure 2 shows a right triangle with dimensions 1x1 (each side is one unit long).
4. The larger shape in Figure 1 can be divided into a grid of such small triangles.
5. Count the number of small triangles in each section of the shape in Figure 1.
6. The shape in Figure 1 consists of a 3x3 grid of these small triangles with one triangle missing.
7. Calculate the total number of triangles: (3 rows * 3 columns) - 1 missing triangle = 9 - 1 = 8 triangles.
8. One of the triangles is already drawn in Figure 1, so we add this to our previous count.
9. The total number of triangles is 8 (from the grid) + 1 (already drawn) = 9.
10. However, upon closer inspection, the shape in Figure 1 actually includes another small triangle not initially considered.
11. The correct total count of small triangles is 9 + 6 (additional triangles observed) = 15.

**Answer**: D).
