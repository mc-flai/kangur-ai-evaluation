To determine which ball weighs 30 grams, we need to analyze the given weights and the balances shown in the image.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Given Weights**:
   - The five balls weigh: 30 g, 50 g, 50 g, 50 g, and 80 g.

2. **Analyzing the Balances**:
   - The first balance shows C and D are balanced. Hence, C = D.
   - The second balance shows A and B are balanced. Hence, A = B.
   - The third balance shows E and B are balanced. Hence, E = B.
   - The fourth balance shows A and C are balanced. Hence, A = C.
   - The fifth balance shows E, C, and B are all balanced. Hence, E = C = B.

3. **From the Balances**:
   - Since A = B = C = E, these four balls must have the same weight.
   - Therefore, A, B, C, and E must be the 50 g balls since they balance each other.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The remaining ball, which is not balanced with any other ball, must be the one weighing 30 g.
   - The only ball not mentioned in the balances is D.

Therefore, the ball that weighs 30 g is D.

Reasoning: The balances show that A, B, C, and E all weigh the same, and since there are four 50 g balls, the remaining ball must be the 30 g ball.
Answer: D).
