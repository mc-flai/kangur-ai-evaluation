To determine which shapes Ben cannot cut out as two identical pieces from a 4x3 grid, let's examine each option and see if it's possible to divide it into two identical pieces.

- **Option A**: This shape consists of two horizontal pieces stacked vertically. It can be cut into two identical L-shaped pieces.
- **Option B**: This shape consists of two horizontal squares next to each other. It can be cut into two identical 1x2 rectangular pieces.
- **Option C**: This shape consists of three horizontal squares in a line. This cannot be cut into two identical pieces because it has an odd number of squares.
- **Option D**: This shape consists of two vertical squares stacked horizontally. It can be cut into two identical 1x1 square pieces.
- **Option E**: This shape consists of two vertical squares stacked horizontally with one square on top of them. It can be cut into two identical pieces, one being an L-shape and the other being a single square.

Based on this analysis, Option C is the shape that cannot be cut into two identical pieces from the 4x3 grid.

Reasoning: Option C cannot be divided into two identical pieces because it has an odd number of squares in a configuration that prevents symmetrical division.
Answer: C).
