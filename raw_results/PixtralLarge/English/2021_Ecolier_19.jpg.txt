**Reasoning**: To determine the number placed in the shaded square, we need to analyze the sums of neighboring numbers for each given number in the squares.

1. The sum of the neighboring numbers for 7 is 15. This implies that the neighboring numbers are likely 6 and 9 because 6 + 9 = 15.
2. The sum of the neighboring numbers for 9 (to the right of 7) is 3. This implies that the neighboring numbers are likely 2 and 1 because 2 + 1 = 3.
3. The sum of the neighboring numbers for 11 is 15. This suggests neighboring numbers are likely 4 and 11 because 4 + 11 = 15.
4. The sum of the neighboring numbers for 9 (to the right of 11) is 8. This implies that the neighboring numbers are likely 5 and 3 because 5 + 3 = 8.

From the given sums, the only reasonable placement for the number in the shaded square is 4, as it fits the pattern where 4 is a neighbor to 11.

**Answer**: A).
