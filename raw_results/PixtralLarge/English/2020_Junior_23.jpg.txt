**Reasoning**:
1. The problem involves a rectangular sheet with one side of 12 cm folded along its 20 cm diagonal.
2. When the rectangle is folded along the diagonal, it forms two overlapping right-angled triangles.
3. The area of each right-angled triangle can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle: \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \).
4. Here, the base and height are the sides of the rectangle, which are 12 cm and the other side (20 cm diagonal's projection on the base, but not directly needed).
5. So, the area of one triangle is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ cm} \times 12 \text{ cm} = 72 \text{ cm}^2 \).
6. Since the sheet is folded along the diagonal, the overlapping area is exactly one of these triangles.
7. Therefore, the overlapping area is \( 72 \text{ cm}^2 \).
