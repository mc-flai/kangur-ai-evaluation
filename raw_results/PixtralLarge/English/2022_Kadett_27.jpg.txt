To determine the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a 5x5 grid so that every possible 1x4 rectangle and every 4x1 rectangle has at least one cell colored in, we need to consider the optimal placement strategy.

**Reasoning**:
1. A 5x5 grid has 25 cells in total.
2. A 1x4 rectangle will span 4 consecutive cells in a single row, and a 4x1 rectangle will span 4 consecutive cells in a single column.
3. To ensure every 1x4 rectangle has at least one cell colored, we can color one cell in each row. Similarly, to ensure every 4x1 rectangle has at least one cell colored, we can color one cell in each column.
4. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, coloring one cell in each row and each column will ensure that the requirement is met.
5. Therefore, we need to color at least 5 cells (one in each row and one in each column) to satisfy the condition.

**Answer**: A)
