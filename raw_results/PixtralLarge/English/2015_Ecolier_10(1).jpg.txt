To determine which number is on the face opposite to the face with the number 3, we need to consider how a paper net folds into a cube. The given paper net is as follows:

```
2 3 4
  5
  6
```

When this net is folded into a cube, the number 3 will be adjacent to 2, 4, and 5. The face opposite to the face with number 3 will be the face that is not adjacent to it.

Here is the layout of the cube:

- Face with 2 is adjacent to 3.
- Face with 4 is adjacent to 3.
- Face with 5 is adjacent to 3.
- Face with 6 is not adjacent to 3, thus it must be opposite to 3.

Therefore, the number on the face that is opposite to the face with the number 3 is 6.

Reasoning: The number on the face that is opposite to the face with the number 3 is 6 because it is not adjacent to 3 in the folded cube.
Answer: E).
