**Reasoning**: To determine the number of different possibilities Susi has to visit exactly two animals without starting with the lion, we need to calculate the number of combinations of 2 animals out of the 3 available options (giraffe, elephant, and turtle), and then multiply by the number of permutations for each pair (since the order matters).

1. Calculate the number of combinations of 2 animals out of the 3 available:
   - Choose 2 out of 3 animals: C(3, 2) = 3! / (2! * (3-2)!) = 3

2. Calculate the number of permutations for each pair (since the order matters):
   - For each pair, there are 2! = 2 permutations.

3. Multiply the number of combinations by the number of permutations:
   - Total possibilities = 3 combinations * 2 permutations per combination = 6

4. Add the single case where Susi visits the lion last (which involves choosing 1 out of the remaining 3 animals to visit first):
   - Choose 1 out of 3 animals: C(3, 1) = 3

5. Total possibilities:
   - Total = 6 (from the pairs) + 3 (from visiting the lion last) = 9

**Answer**: D).
