**Reasoning**: Yvonne states that she has more stars than planets. Let's examine the options given to see which one fits this description:

- (A) 4 planets, 1 star, 0 moons.
- (B) 1 planet, 3 stars, 0 moons.
- (C) 3 planets, 1 star, 2 moons.
- (D) 2 planets, 2 stars, 2 moons.
- (E) 2 planets, 3 stars, 1 moon.

From Yvonne's statement, we need the number of stars to be greater than the number of planets. Options (A), (C), and (D) can be eliminated because they either have more planets than stars or an equal number of planets and stars.

Option (B) has 1 planet and 3 stars, which fits Yvonne's criteria.
Option (E) also has fewer planets than stars (2 planets and 3 stars), which fits Yvonne's criteria.

However, only Option (B) has no moons, which aligns with Yvonne's statement of having more stars than planets without any additional conflicting details.

**Answer**: B).
