To solve this problem, we need to determine the first true statement regarding the order of (A) â€“ (E). Let's analyze the statements one by one:

1. **(A) (C) is true.**
   - If (A) were true, that would mean (C) is true.
   - However, (C) says that (E) is false. If (E) is false, then \(1 + 1 \neq 2\), which is not true. Thus, (C) is false.
   - Therefore, (A) is false.

2. **(B) (A) is true.**
   - From the analysis above, we know (A) is false.
   - So, (B) is false.

3. **(C) (E) is false.**
   - (E) is \(1 + 1 = 2\), which is true.
   - Hence, (C) is false.

4. **(D) (B) is false.**
   - From above, we've already established that (B) is false.
   - Thus, (D) is true.

5. **(E) \(1 + 1 = 2\)**
   - This is a true mathematical statement.

Since we are asked for the first true statement, it is (D).

Reasoning: By analyzing each statement systematically, we determined that (D) is the first true statement since (A), (B), and (C) are all false.
Answer: D).
