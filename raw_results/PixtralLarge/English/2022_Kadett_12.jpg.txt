To determine where the new tree should be planted, we need to ensure that there is an equal number of trees on both sides of each path. With 5 trees already planted, adding another one makes a total of 6 trees. Thus, each path must have 3 trees on both sides.

1. **Analyzing Paths Connected to Section A**:
   - Section A is connected to sections B, C, and E.
   - If we place the new tree in section A, sections B, C, and E must each have 2 trees to balance the sides.
   - Currently, B and C each have 2 trees, and E has 1 tree.
   - Adding the new tree to section A does not balance the sides correctly, as section E still needs another tree.

2. **Analyzing Paths Connected to Section B**:
   - Section B is connected to sections A, C, and E.
   - If we place the new tree in section B, sections A, C, and E must each have 2 trees to balance the sides.
   - Currently, A has 1 tree and C has 2 trees, and E has 1 tree.
   - Adding the new tree to section B balances the sides correctly, with 2 trees on both sides of each path.

3. **Analyzing Paths Connected to Section C**:
   - Section C is connected to sections A, B, and E.
   - If we place the new tree in section C, sections A, B, and E must each have 2 trees to balance the sides.
   - Currently, A has 1 tree, B has 2 trees, and E has 1 tree.
   - Adding the new tree to section C does not balance the sides correctly, as sections A and E still need another tree.

4. **Analyzing Paths Connected to Section D**:
   - Section D is connected to sections B and E.
   - If we place the new tree in section D, sections B and E must each have 3 trees to balance the sides.
   - Currently, B has 2 trees and E has 1 tree.
   - Adding the new tree to section D does not balance the sides correctly, as sections B and E still need another tree.

5. **Analyzing Paths Connected to Section E**:
   - Section E is connected to sections A, B, C, and D.
   - If we place the new tree in section E, sections A, B, C, and D must each have 2 trees to balance the sides.
   - Currently, A has 1 tree, B has 2 trees, C has 2 trees, and D has 0 trees.
   - Adding the new tree to section E does not balance the sides correctly, as sections A and D still need another tree.

Given the analysis, placing the new tree in section B will ensure that there are an equal number of trees on both sides of each path.

Reasoning: Placing the new tree in section B ensures that there are 3 trees on both sides of each path, which is the goal.
Answer: B).
