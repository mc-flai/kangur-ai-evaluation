**Reasoning**:
- Let's denote the number of trees with 6 pears and 3 apples as x.
- Let's denote the number of trees with 8 pears and 4 apples as y.
- According to the problem, the total number of apples on the magic trees is 25.
- We can set up the following equation based on the number of apples:
  3x + 4y = 25.
- The total number of pears can be calculated using the equation:
  6x + 8y.

Now, we need to find values of x and y that satisfy the equation 3x + 4y = 25.
- Let's test possible integer values for x and y:
  - If x = 1 and y = 5, then 3(1) + 4(5) = 3 + 20 = 23 (not equal to 25).
  - If x = 3 and y = 4, then 3(3) + 4(4) = 9 + 16 = 25 (this satisfies the equation).

Using x = 3 and y = 4:
- Total number of pears = 6x + 8y = 6(3) + 8(4) = 18 + 32 = 50.

**Answer**: D).
