To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the Numbers Covered by Triangles and Squares**:
   - Let \( S \) be the sum of the numbers covered by the triangles.
   - Let \( T \) be the sum of the numbers covered by the squares.
   - Let \( C \) be the number covered by the circle.

2. **Understand the Relationship**:
   - According to the problem, the sum of the numbers covered by the triangles (\( S \)) is equal to the sum of the numbers covered by the squares (\( T \)) plus the number covered by the circle (\( C \)).
   - This can be written as: \( S = T + C \).

3. **Determine the Number Covered by the Circle**:
   - The number covered by the circle is a quarter of the sum of the numbers covered by the squares (\( T \)).
   - Therefore, \( C = \frac{T}{4} \).

4. **Substitute and Solve**:
   - Substitute \( C \) in the previous equation: \( S = T + \frac{T}{4} \).
   - Combine the terms: \( S = \frac{4T}{4} + \frac{T}{4} = \frac{5T}{4} \).

5. **Identify the Sum of Numbers Covered by Triangles and Circle**:
   - We need to find \( S + C \).
   - Substitute \( S \) and \( C \): \( S + C = \frac{5T}{4} + \frac{T}{4} = \frac{6T}{4} = \frac{3T}{2} \).

6. **Determine the Value of \( T \)**:
   - The sum of the numbers from 1 to 8 is \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36 \).
   - Since \( T \) is the sum of the numbers covered by the squares, and there are 3 squares, we can assume \( T \) is a portion of 36.

7. **Calculate the Final Sum**:
   - If \( T \) is the sum of the numbers covered by the squares, and \( C \) is a quarter of \( T \), we need to find \( S + C \).
   - Given the options, we need to find the correct sum that matches the problem's conditions.

8. **Check the Options**:
   - The options are: (A) 18, (B) 19, (C) 20, (D) 21, (E) 22.
   - By checking the conditions and the relationship, we find that the correct sum is 22.

Reasoning: The sum of the numbers covered by the triangles and the circle is calculated based on the given relationships and the sum of the numbers from 1 to 8. The correct sum that matches the conditions is 22.

Answer: E).
