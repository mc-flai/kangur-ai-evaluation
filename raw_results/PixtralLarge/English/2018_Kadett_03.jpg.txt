**Reasoning**:
1. Calculate the perimeter of triangle ABC:
   - The side lengths of triangle ABC are 6 cm, 10 cm, and 11 cm.
   - Perimeter of triangle ABC = 6 cm + 10 cm + 11 cm = 27 cm.

2. Since triangle XYZ is an equilateral triangle with the same perimeter as triangle ABC, each side of triangle XYZ must be equal.

3. Divide the perimeter by 3 to find the length of each side of the equilateral triangle XYZ:
   - Perimeter of triangle XYZ = 27 cm.
   - Each side of triangle XYZ = 27 cm / 3 = 9 cm.

**Answer**: B)
