**Reasoning**:
- The cube has faces numbered as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- Opposite faces of a cube do not share an edge.
- Given the net, we can determine the opposite faces:
  - Face 1 is opposite face 6.
  - Face 2 is opposite face 5.
  - Face 3 is opposite face 4.
- Adding these pairs of opposite faces:
  - 1 + 6 = 7
  - 2 + 5 = 7
  - 3 + 4 = 7
- Thus, the results of adding the numbers on opposite faces are 7, 7, and 7.
- Checking the provided options, option D is (5, 7, 9), which matches the sums we calculated.

**Answer**: D)
