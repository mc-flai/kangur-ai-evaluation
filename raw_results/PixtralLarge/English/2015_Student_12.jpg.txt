To determine the number of regions into which the coordinate plane is split by the graphs of \( f(x) = 2 - x^2 \) and \( g(x) = x^2 - 1 \), let's analyze the intersection points and the shapes formed by these curves.

1. **Understanding the curves**:
   - \( f(x) = 2 - x^2 \) is an inverted parabola with a vertex at \( (0, 2) \).
   - \( g(x) = x^2 - 1 \) is an upright parabola with a vertex at \( (0, -1) \).

2. **Intersection points**:
   - To find the intersection points, set \( f(x) = g(x) \):
     \[
     2 - x^2 = x^2 - 1
     \]
     \[
     2x^2 = 3
     \]
     \[
     x^2 = \frac{3}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}
     \]
   - Therefore, the intersection points are \( (\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}, \frac{1}{2}) \) and \( (-\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}, \frac{1}{2}) \).

3. **Regions analysis**:
   - The curves intersect at two points, splitting the plane into several distinct regions.
   - The inverted parabola \( f(x) \) intersects the upright parabola \( g(x) \) above the x-axis.
   - Considering the regions formed:
     - The region above both parabolas.
     - The region between the parabolas from \( x = -\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \) to \( x = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \).
     - The region below both parabolas.
     - The regions to the left of \( x = -\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \) and to the right of \( x = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \).
   - Each of these regions can be further divided by the x-axis.

4. **Counting the regions**:
   - By plotting and visualizing, you can see that the curves and the x-axis split the plane into 10 distinct regions.

Reasoning: Analyzing the curves, finding the intersection points, and visualizing the regions show that the coordinate plane is split into 10 regions.
