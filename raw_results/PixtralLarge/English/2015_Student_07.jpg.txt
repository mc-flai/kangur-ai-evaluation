To determine the correct answer for question 7, we need to understand the properties of a convex quadrilateral. A quadrilateral is called convex if all its internal angles are less than 180 degrees.

The possible values for the number of right angles (n) in a convex quadrilateral can be determined as follows:

1. A quadrilateral has four angles.
2. For a quadrilateral to be convex, all internal angles must be less than 180 degrees.
3. A right angle is exactly 90 degrees.
4. The maximum number of right angles in a convex quadrilateral is 4 (since all angles could be right angles).
5. The minimum number of right angles in a convex quadrilateral can be 0 (none of the angles are right angles).

Given these constraints, the possible values of n are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Now, let's review the options:
- (A) 0, 1, 2
- (B) 0, 1, 2, 4
- (C) 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- (D) 0, 1, 3
- (E) 1, 2, 3

The only complete listing of all possible values of n is (C) 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

Reasoning: The number of right angles in a convex quadrilateral can range from 0 to 4, which means the complete list of possible values is 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Answer: C)
