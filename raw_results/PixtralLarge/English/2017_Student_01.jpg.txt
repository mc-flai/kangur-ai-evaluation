To determine the number on the tile marked with "??", we need to follow the rule provided: the number on each tile is equal to the sum of the numbers on the two tiles directly below it.

1. We are given the numbers 2039 and 2020 on the bottom tiles.
2. To find the number on the tile marked with "??", we simply add these two numbers together:

   2039 + 2020 = 4059

Thus, the number on the tile marked with "??" is 4059.

Now, let's look at the options provided:

- (A) 15
- (B) 16
- (C) 17
- (D) 18
- (E) 19

None of the options A-E match the number 4059. This suggests there might be an error in the problem statement or options provided.

Reasoning: Since none of the provided options match the calculated answer based on the rule given, there seems to be an inconsistency in the options.

Answer: None of the options A, B, C, D, or E are correct.
