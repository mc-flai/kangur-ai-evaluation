**Reasoning**: 
1. Observe the diagram: There are three darts flying towards a total of nine balloons.
2. Analyze each dart's path:
   - The first dart (green) hits one balloon.
   - The second dart (blue) hits two balloons.
   - The third dart (red) hits two balloons.
3. Sum the number of balloons hit by each dart: 
   - 1 (green) + 2 (blue) + 2 (red) = 5.
4. Conclude that a total of 5 balloons are hit by the darts.

**Answer**: D)
