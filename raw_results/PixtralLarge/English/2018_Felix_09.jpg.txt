To determine which picture Charles sees after he cuts the rope into three equally long pieces and makes specific knots in each piece, we need to analyze the pattern of knots and the order of the pieces visually.

1. Charles cuts the rope into three equal pieces.
2. He ties one knot in the first piece, two knots in the second piece, and three knots in the third piece.
3. He then lays these pieces down in a random order.

We need to identify the piece with 1 knot, the piece with 2 knots, and the piece with 3 knots in random order.

Let's analyze the options:
- (A): 1 knot, 3 knots, 2 knots
- (B): 1 knot, 2 knots, 3 knots
- (C): 3 knots, 1 knot, 2 knots
- (D): 2 knots, 1 knot, 3 knots
- (E): 3 knots, 2 knots, 1 knot

Option (A) has the pieces in the order of 1 knot, 3 knots, 2 knots, which matches the description of Charles laying the pieces down in a random order.

Reasoning: The arrangement in option (A) matches the given description of one knot in one piece, two knots in another piece, and three knots in the third piece, laid out in a random order.

Answer: A)
