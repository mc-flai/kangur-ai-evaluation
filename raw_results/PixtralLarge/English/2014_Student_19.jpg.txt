To determine the smallest possible value of M, we need to identify the 10 different positive whole numbers such that 5 of them are divisible by 5 and 7 of them are divisible by 7.

1. List the first 10 multiples of 7: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70.
2. From these, identify the numbers that are also multiples of 5: 35, 70.
3. We need to find 3 more numbers that are multiples of 5 but not already included in our list of multiples of 7. The smallest such numbers are 5, 10, and 15.
4. Therefore, the 10 numbers are: 5, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49.
5. The largest number among these is 49.

**Reasoning**: The smallest value of M is 49, which is not among the given options (A, B, C, D). Hence, the correct choice is (E) another value.

**Answer**: E)
