**Reasoning**:

1. The slow snail crawls 1 meter in one hour, and the fast snail crawls 2 meters in one hour.
2. The combined speed of both snails is 1 m/h + 2 m/h = 3 m/h.
3. They start at the same point S and move in different directions along the edge of the square-shaped garden.
4. The total length of the garden's perimeter is 2 m + 2 m + 2 m + 2 m = 8 meters.
5. Since they move in opposite directions, they will meet after covering a combined distance of half the perimeter, which is 8 m / 2 = 4 meters.
6. At a combined speed of 3 m/h, they will meet after 4 m / 3 m/h = 1.33 hours (or 1 hour and 20 minutes).
7. In 1.33 hours:
   - The slow snail will have crawled 1 m/h * 1.33 h = 1.33 meters.
   - The fast snail will have crawled 2 m/h * 1.33 h = 2.67 meters.
8. If the slow snail crawls 1.33 meters from S, it will be at point B (since each side of the square is 2 meters, and 1.33 meters is more than halfway along one side).

**Answer**: B
