**Reasoning**: To solve this problem, we need to figure out the minimum number of touches required to turn all circles black. Consider the following:

1. When Lucy touches a circle, it and all its neighbors change color (from white to black or black to white).
2. If Lucy touches one circle, that circle and its neighbors (up to 3 others, given the arrangement) will change color.
3. However, if Lucy touches only one circle, not all circles will be affected.
4. If Lucy touches two circles, she might change the color of at most 6 circles (each touch can affect up to 4 circles if they are adjacent).
5. If Lucy touches three circles, she might change the color of up to 9 circles (each touch can affect up to 4 circles if they are adjacent).
6. If Lucy touches four circles, she might change the color of up to 12 circles (each touch can affect up to 4 circles if they are adjacent).

To ensure all 4 circles turn black, Lucy must at least touch 3 circles. This is because:
- Touching any single circle will not ensure that all circles are flipped.
- Touching two circles might still leave some circles unflipped depending on the arrangement.
- Touching three circles ensures that each circle is touched at least once directly or indirectly.

**Answer**: B)
