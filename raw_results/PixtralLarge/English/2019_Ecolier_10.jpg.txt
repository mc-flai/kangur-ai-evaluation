**Reasoning**: The original shape consists of 3 squares. After Dennis takes off one of the squares, he is left with 2 squares. We need to determine how many of the 5 given shapes can be formed with 2 squares.

From the given shapes:

- The first shape has 3 squares (not possible).
- The second shape has 2 squares (possible).
- The third shape has 3 squares (not possible).
- The fourth shape has 3 squares (not possible).
- The fifth shape has 3 squares (not possible).

Only the second shape matches the requirement of having 2 squares.

**Answer**: B)
