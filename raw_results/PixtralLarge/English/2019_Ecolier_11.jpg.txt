To solve this problem, let's break down the steps described in the question:

1. The entire cake is halved, resulting in two pieces.
2. One of those halves is halved again, resulting in two quarters.
3. One of the quarters is halved again, resulting in two eighths.
4. One of these eighths is halved again, resulting in two sixteenths.

From the diagram and the description, the smallest piece weighs 100 grams. This piece represents 1/16 of the entire cake.

To find the weight of the entire cake, we multiply the weight of the smallest piece by 16:

\[ 100 \, \text{g} \times 16 = 1600 \, \text{g} \]

Reasoning: The smallest piece weighs 100 grams and represents 1/16 of the cake. To find the weight of the entire cake, multiply 100 grams by 16.
