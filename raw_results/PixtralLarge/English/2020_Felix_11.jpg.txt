   - **Option B**: The configuration uses 5 cubes.
   - **Option C**: The configuration uses 6 cubes.
   - **Option D**: The configuration uses 7 cubes.
   - **Option E**: The configuration uses 6 cubes.
3. **Determine the Minimum**: Among the provided options, both A and B use 5 cubes. However, since we need to choose only one, we can select either A or B. Let's choose A for simplicity.
