To determine how many three-digit natural numbers have the property that when their digits are written in reverse order, the result is a three-digit number which is 99 more than the original number, we need to follow these steps:

1. Let the original three-digit number be represented as \(100a + 10b + c\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the digits of the number and \(a \neq 0\) (since it is a three-digit number).
2. The reversed number would be \(100c + 10b + a\).
3. According to the problem, the reversed number is 99 more than the original number. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   100c + 10b + a = 100a + 10b + c + 99
   \]
4. Simplifying this equation, we get:
   \[
   100c + a = 100a + c + 99
   \]
5. Rearranging the terms, we have:
   \[
   99c - 99a = 99
   \]
6. Dividing both sides by 99, we get:
   \[
   c - a = 1
   \]
7. This means that the units digit (c) must be 1 more than the hundreds digit (a).

8. Since \(a\) and \(c\) are digits, \(a\) can take values from 1 to 8 (because \(a\) must be a non-zero digit and \(c\) must be a valid digit), and for each value of \(a\), \(c\) is determined as \(a + 1\).

9. The possible pairs \((a, c)\) are:
   - \(a = 1, c = 2\)
   - \(a = 2, c = 3\)
   - \(a = 3, c = 4\)
   - \(a = 4, c = 5\)
   - \(a = 5, c = 6\)
   - \(a = 6, c = 7\)
   - \(a = 7, c = 8\)
   - \(a = 8, c = 9\)

10. There are 8 such pairs.

Reasoning: By following the steps above, we find that there are 8 three-digit natural numbers that satisfy the given condition.
