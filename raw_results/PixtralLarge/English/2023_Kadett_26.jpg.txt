**Reasoning**: To determine how many mice used the path indicated with an arrow, let's analyze the provided diagram step by step.

1. The arrow labeled "gestern" (yesterday) shows the number of mice that moved from their original house to another house.
2. The number of mice in each house yesterday were:
   - Top house: 8 mice
   - Bottom-left house: 7 mice
   - Bottom-right house: 10 mice
3. The arrow indicates the number of mice that moved from the bottom-left house (7 mice yesterday) to the bottom-right house (5 mice today).
4. According to the diagram, 5 mice moved from the bottom-left house to the bottom-right house.

Thus, the number of mice that used the path indicated with the arrow is 5. However, since the problem asks for the total number of mice that used the paths (both directions), we also need to consider the path labeled "heute" (today), which shows 6 mice moving from the bottom-right house (10 mice yesterday) to the bottom-left house (4 mice today).

Adding these up:
5 mice from the bottom-left house to the bottom-right house plus 6 mice from the bottom-right house to the bottom-left house gives a total of 11 mice that used the paths indicated by the arrows.

**Answer**: B).
