The problem involves two concentric circles with radii 1 and 9 that form an annulus. We need to find the biggest possible value of n, where n circles without overlap are drawn inside this annulus, each of which touches both circles of the annulus.

To solve this, we need to determine how many such circles can fit within the annular region. Let's denote the radius of the smaller circle in the annulus as r_small and the radius of the larger circle as r_large. For n circles to fit without overlap, each circle must have a diameter equal to or less than the difference in radii of the two concentric circles, which is 9 - 1 = 8.

Each of the n circles will have a diameter of 8/n. The circles must fit within the annulus in such a way that they touch both the inner and outer circles of the annulus. The maximum number of circles that can fit within the annulus is when the circles are tangent to each other and to both the inner and outer circles.

For the maximum value of n, the diameter of each circle should be as small as possible while still fitting within the annulus. This means that the diameter of each circle should be equal to 8/n.

Now, we need to determine the maximum number of such circles that can fit within the annulus. This can be done by considering the circumference of the inner circle (which is 2π * 1 = 2π) and the circumference of the outer circle (which is 2π * 9 = 18π). The circles will fit along the circumference of the inner circle, and the distance between the centers of adjacent circles will be equal to the diameter of the circles.

The maximum number of circles that can fit along the circumference of the inner circle is given by the ratio of the circumference of the inner circle to the diameter of each circle:

n = 2π / (8/n) = 2πn / 8

To find the maximum value of n, we need to solve this equation for n. However, since the circles must also fit within the annulus, we need to consider the distance between the centers of the circles and the outer circle. The distance between the centers of adjacent circles is equal to the diameter of the circles, which is 8/n.

The maximum number of circles that can fit within the annulus is when the distance between the centers of the circles is equal to the difference in radii of the two concentric circles, which is 8. Therefore, the maximum value of n is given by:

n = 8 / (8/n) = n

This means that the maximum value of n is 8, but since we are given the options A) 1, B) 2, C) 3, D) 4, E) 5, the maximum value of n that fits within the annulus is 4.

Reasoning: The maximum number of circles that can fit within the annulus without overlap, each touching both the inner and outer circles, is determined by the ratio of the difference in radii of the two concentric circles to the diameter of each circle. The maximum value of n is 4, as it fits within the given options.
