**Reasoning**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Let's evaluate each option to see if the result is a prime number:

- (A) 2 + 11 = 13, which is a prime number.
- (B) 4 + 7 = 11, which is a prime number.
- (C) 6 + 11 = 17, which is a prime number.
- (D) 3 + 4 = 7, which is a prime number.
- (E) 5 + 7 = 12, which is not a prime number.

Since 12 is not a prime number, the correct answer is option (E).

**Answer**: E).
