To determine the length of the fence, we need to analyze the given information and the layout of the garden and the artificial lake.

1. The garden is rectangular and measures 50 m by 40 m.
2. The entire area, including the garden and the artificial lake, is a 60 m square.
3. The fence divides the entire area into two equal parts.

First, calculate the area of the entire square:
\[ \text{Area of square} = 60 \, \text{m} \times 60 \, \text{m} = 3600 \, \text{m}^2 \]

Next, calculate the area of the garden:
\[ \text{Area of garden} = 50 \, \text{m} \times 40 \, \text{m} = 2000 \, \text{m}^2 \]

The artificial lake occupies the remaining area:
\[ \text{Area of lake} = 3600 \, \text{m}^2 - 2000 \, \text{m}^2 = 1600 \, \text{m}^2 \]

Since the fence divides the entire area into two equal parts, each part will have an area of:
\[ \text{Area of each part} = \frac{3600 \, \text{m}^2}{2} = 1800 \, \text{m}^2 \]

The area of one part consists of half the garden and half the lake. Therefore, the area of the part containing the garden is:
\[ \text{Area of garden part} = 2000 \, \text{m}^2 - 800 \, \text{m}^2 \]

The area of the part containing the lake is:
\[ \text{Area of lake part} = 1600 \, \text{m}^2 - 800 \, \text{m}^2 \]

Now, to find the length of the fence, we need to consider the diagonal of the square. The diagonal can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{(60 \, \text{m})^2 + (60 \, \text{m})^2} = \sqrt{3600 \, \text{m}^2 + 3600 \, \text{m}^2} = \sqrt{7200 \, \text{m}^2} = 60\sqrt{2} \, \text{m} \]

Since the fence is half the diagonal of the square, the length of the fence is:
\[ \text{Length of fence} = \frac{60\sqrt{2} \, \text{m}}{2} = 30\sqrt{2} \, \text{m} \]

However, the correct answer should be the full diagonal of the square, which is:
\[ 60\sqrt{2} \, \text{m} \]

Reasoning: The fence divides the entire area into two equal parts, and the length of the fence is the diagonal of the square.
