To determine which path is the longest between points X and Y in the given options, let's analyze each figure:

- **Figure A**: The path goes through 5 concentric circles.
- **Figure B**: The path goes through 4 concentric circles.
- **Figure C**: The path goes through 5 concentric circles.
- **Figure D**: The path goes through 4 concentric circles.
- **Figure E**: The path goes through 4 concentric circles.

By comparing the number of concentric circles each path passes through, we can determine which path is the longest. Figures A and C both pass through 5 concentric circles. However, Figure A has an additional segment through the outermost circle, making it longer than Figure C.

Reasoning: Figure A passes through the most concentric circles and has the longest path due to the additional outermost segment compared to Figure C.
Answer: A).
