To solve question 28, let us define the quantities of blue and red rectangles and squares:

1. Let's denote the number of blue rectangles as B.
2. Let's denote the number of red rectangles as R.
3. We know that exactly 7 of the rectangles are squares.
4. There are 3 more red rectangles than blue squares.
5. There are also two more red squares than blue rectangles.

Let's denote the number of blue squares as BS and red squares as RS.

Given:
- R = BS + 3
- RS = B + 2

Now, let's analyze the information given:
- The number of blue squares (BS) must be such that the number of red rectangles (R) is 3 more than BS.
- The number of red squares (RS) must be such that it is 2 more than the number of blue rectangles (B).

We need to find the number of blue rectangles (B).

From the given information, let's assume the number of blue rectangles (B) is 5.
- Then the number of red squares (RS) is B + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7.
- The number of blue squares (BS) must satisfy the equation R = BS + 3.
- We know that RS = 7, so BS must be 7 - 3 = 4.

So, there are 5 blue rectangles.

Reasoning: From the given conditions and equations, we deduced the number of blue rectangles to be 5.
