**Reasoning**:
1. The problem involves a square touching two circles with radius 1, each touching a straight line (the common tangent).
2. The side length of the square must be determined based on its positioning.
3. Since the square has one edge on the straight line and the other vertices touching the circles, we can infer that the side length of the square is the distance between the straight line and the point where the vertex touches the circle.
4. Given that the radius of each circle is 1, the distance from the straight line to the center of the circle (radius) is 1.
5. Therefore, the side length of the square, which spans from the straight line to the point of tangency on the circle, is 1 unit.

**Answer**: E) 1/2.
