To determine which sum will be in the middle when the results of the given additions are written in descending order, we first need to calculate each sum:

- (A) \(1 + 2 + 345 = 348\)
- (B) \(12 + 3 + 45 = 60\)
- (C) \(1 + 23 + 45 = 69\)
- (D) \(12 + 34 + 5 = 51\)
- (E) \(1 + 234 + 5 = 240\)

Next, we arrange these sums in descending order:

\(348, 240, 69, 60, 51\)

From this ordered list, we can see that the sum in the middle is \(69\).

Reasoning: The middle value of the ordered list \(348, 240, 69, 60, 51\) is \(69\).
Answer: C).
