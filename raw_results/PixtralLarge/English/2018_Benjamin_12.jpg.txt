1. The image shows four smudges, each hiding one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
2. The arrows indicate mathematical operations involving these numbers, leading to a final result of 8.
3. To determine the number hidden behind the smudge with the star, we need to figure out which number completes the calculations shown.

**Reasoning**:
1. The given arithmetic operations are:
   - Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (×), and Division (÷).
2. Let's check which number fits when placed behind the star to get the result 8:
   - If the number behind the star is 1:
     - Operations: 2 × 1 + 4 ÷ 3 - 5 = 2 + 1.33 - 5 ≠ 8.
   - If the number behind the star is 2:
     - Operations: 3 × 2 + 4 ÷ 3 - 5 = 6 + 1.33 - 5 ≠ 8.
   - If the number behind the star is 3:
     - Operations: 4 × 3 + 2 ÷ 1 - 5 = 12 + 2 - 5 = 9 ≠ 8.
   - If the number behind the star is 4:
     - Operations: 1 × 4 + 3 ÷ 2 - 5 = 4 + 1.5 - 5 ≠ 8.
   - If the number behind the star is 5:
     - Operations: 1 × 5 + 3 ÷ 2 - 4 = 5 + 1.5 - 4 = 8.

3. Therefore, the correct number hidden behind the smudge with the star is 5.

Answer: E).
