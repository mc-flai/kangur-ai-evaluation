Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are twelve girls.
2. On average, they ate 1.5 muffins each.
3. This means the total number of muffins eaten by the twelve girls is 12 * 1.5 = 18 muffins.
4. None of the girls ate more than two muffins, and two of the girls ate nothing.
5. So, the number of muffins eaten by the girls who ate nothing is 0.
6. The total number of muffins eaten by the girls who ate something is 18.
7. If two girls ate nothing, then ten girls ate the 18 muffins.
8. The remaining 18 muffins must be distributed among the ten girls who ate something, and none ate more than two.
9. To find out how many girls ate exactly two muffins, consider the following:
   - Let x be the number of girls who ate two muffins.
   - Then, 10 - x girls ate one muffin each.
   - The total muffins eaten is then 2x (from the girls who ate two muffins) + (10 - x) (from the girls who ate one muffin).
   - This gives us the equation: 2x + 10 - x = 18
10. Simplify the equation to find x:
    - 2x + 10 - x = 18
    - x + 10 = 18
    - x = 8

Therefore, eight girls ate two muffins.

Reasoning: Based on the calculations and logical deductions provided, eight girls must have eaten two muffins each.
