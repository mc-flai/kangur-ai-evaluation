To solve question 16, we need to determine how the lengths of the rubber bands in the two different configurations of the six tubes are related.

1. **Left Picture Analysis**:
    - The tubes are arranged in a single row.
    - Each tube has a diameter of 2 cm, so the length of the rubber band will be twice the diameter (covering the long side of the tubes) plus the small gaps between each tube.
    - There are 6 tubes, so the length of the rubber band is 6 * 2 cm = 12 cm.
    - Plus, there are 5 gaps of a negligible amount (assuming the band is stretched negligibly between the tubes). Therefore, this is effectively 12 cm.

2. **Right Picture Analysis**:
    - The tubes are arranged in a triangular formation.
    - The perimeter of the rubber band is the sum of the lengths of the sides of the triangle formed by the centers of the tubes.
    - The distance between the centers of adjacent tubes is the diameter of the tubes (2 cm).
    - The sides of the triangle are:
        - Base: 4 cm (distance between the centers of the three tubes at the bottom).
        - Two sides of the triangle: Each side is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with each leg being 2 cm. Using the Pythagorean theorem: \( \sqrt{(2^2 + 2^2)} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2} \) cm.
    - Total length of the band: \( 4 + 2 \times 2\sqrt{2} \).

3. **Comparison**:
    - Left picture band length: 12 cm.
    - Right picture band length: \( 4 + 4\sqrt{2} \) cm.
    - \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \), so \( 4\sqrt{2} \approx 5.656 \).
    - Total length of the right picture band: \( 4 + 5.656 \approx 9.656 \) cm.

Clearly, the band in the left picture is longer than the band in the right picture. The difference is \( 12 - 9.656 = 2.344 \) cm, which is not exactly 4 cm but close enough to choose the closest answer.

Reasoning: The left picture's band is longer than the right picture's band by approximately 2.344 cm. The closest given option is 4 cm shorter.

Answer: B).
