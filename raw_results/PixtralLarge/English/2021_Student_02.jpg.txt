To determine the number of integers in the interval \((20 - \sqrt{21}, 20 + \sqrt{21})\), we need to calculate the bounds of the interval and count the integers within those bounds.

**Step 1**: Calculate \(20 - \sqrt{21}\) and \(20 + \sqrt{21}\).

First, we need to know the approximate value of \(\sqrt{21}\).

\(\sqrt{21} \approx 4.58\)

**Step 2**: Substitute \(\sqrt{21}\) into the interval bounds:

\[20 - \sqrt{21} \approx 20 - 4.58 = 15.42\]
\[20 + \sqrt{21} \approx 20 + 4.58 = 24.58\]

**Step 3**: Determine the range of integers within the interval \((15.42, 24.58)\).

The integers in this range are from 16 to 24 (inclusive).

**Step 4**: Count the integers in this range.

The integers are: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.

There are 9 integers in total.

**Reasoning**: The interval \((20 - \sqrt{21}, 20 + \sqrt{21})\) is approximately \((15.42, 24.58)\), and counting the integers from 16 to 24 gives us a total of 9 integers.

**Answer**: A)
