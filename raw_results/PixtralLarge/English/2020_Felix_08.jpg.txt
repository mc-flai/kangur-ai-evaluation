**Reasoning**: The question states that Ana's drawing has fewer squares than triangles. Let's count the number of squares and triangles in each option:

- Option A: 2 squares, 3 triangles
- Option B: 2 squares, 4 triangles
- Option C: 2 squares, 5 triangles
- Option D: 3 squares, 3 triangles
- Option E: 2 squares, 3 triangles

To meet the criteria of having fewer squares than triangles, we need to find an option where the number of squares is less than the number of triangles. Options A, B, C, and E satisfy this condition, but we need to ensure that it is the only condition required.

Options A, B, C, and E all have fewer squares than triangles. However, option C is the only one with the most significant difference between the number of squares and triangles. Therefore, option C is the best choice.

**Answer**: C)
