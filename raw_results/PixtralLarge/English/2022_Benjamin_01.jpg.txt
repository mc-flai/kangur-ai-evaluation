To solve question 1, we need to determine the correct configuration of the two triangles formed by connecting the even-numbered points and the odd-numbered points.

1. Identify the even-numbered points: 2, 4, 6.
2. Identify the odd-numbered points: 1, 3, 5.
3. Draw two triangles: one using the even-numbered points and the other using the odd-numbered points.

Let's analyze the given options:
- Option A shows both triangles overlapping significantly.
- Option B shows the triangles overlapping but not significantly.
- Option C shows the triangles almost completely overlapping.
- Option D shows one triangle mostly within the other triangle but not overlapping completely.
- Option E shows the triangles partially overlapping but distinct from each other.

By visual inspection, option E matches the description where the triangles are partially overlapping but distinct, which is typical when connecting the points as described.

Reasoning: By connecting the even-numbered points (2, 4, 6) and the odd-numbered points (1, 3, 5), the resulting triangles will partially overlap but remain distinct from each other, which matches option E.

Answer: E).
