To determine which child painted the incorrect number of squares, let's analyze the given options. Each child should have painted three-quarters (3/4) of the total number of little squares on their trays.

1. **Option A** (gray squares):
   - Total squares: 4
   - Three-quarters of the total squares: 4 * (3/4) = 3
   - Painted squares: 3
   - This is correct.

2. **Option B** (green squares):
   - Total squares: 9
   - Three-quarters of the total squares: 9 * (3/4) = 6.75
   - Painted squares: 7
   - This is incorrect since 7 painted squares are not exactly three-quarters of 9.

3. **Option C** (blue squares):
   - Total squares: 8
   - Three-quarters of the total squares: 8 * (3/4) = 6
   - Painted squares: 6
   - This is correct.

4. **Option D** (orange squares):
   - Total squares: 4
   - Three-quarters of the total squares: 4 * (3/4) = 3
   - Painted squares: 3
   - This is correct.

5. **Option F** (pink squares):
   - Total squares: 9
   - Three-quarters of the total squares: 9 * (3/4) = 6.75
   - Painted squares: 7
   - This is incorrect since 7 painted squares are not exactly three-quarters of 9.

Since options A, C, and D are correct, and options B and F are incorrect, the child who was wrong painted the tray shown in option B.

Reasoning: Option B has 7 squares painted out of 9 total squares, which is not exactly three-quarters of the total squares.
Answer: B).
