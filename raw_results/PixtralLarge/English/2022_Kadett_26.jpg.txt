To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of the incorrectly mixed green paint the painter must discard to achieve the correct shade of green by adjusting the remaining paint with additional blue or yellow paint.

Initially, the painter wanted to mix 2 liters of blue paint with 3 liters of yellow paint to obtain 5 liters of green paint. This implies the ratio of blue to yellow in the correct shade of green is 2:3.

However, the painter accidentally mixed 3 liters of blue paint with 2 liters of yellow paint, resulting in 5 liters of an incorrect shade of green. The ratio of blue to yellow in this mixture is 3:2.

To correct this, the painter needs to adjust the ratio back to 2:3. Let's denote the amount of paint to throw away as x liters.

The remaining amount of blue paint will be \(3 - \frac{3}{5}x\) liters, and the remaining amount of yellow paint will be \(2 - \frac{2}{5}x\) liters.

To achieve the correct ratio of 2:3, we set up the following proportion:

\[
\frac{3 - \frac{3}{5}x}{2 - \frac{2}{5}x} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Cross-multiplying to solve for x:

\[
3 \left(3 - \frac{3}{5}x\right) = 2 \left(2 - \frac{2}{5}x\right)
\]

\[
9 - \frac{9}{5}x = 4 - \frac{4}{5}x
\]

\[
9 - 4 = \frac{9}{5}x - \frac{4}{5}x
\]

\[
5 = \frac{5}{5}x
\]

\[
x = 1
\]

Therefore, the minimum amount of the incorrect green paint that the painter has to throw away is 1 liter.

Reasoning: The painter needs to discard 1 liter of the incorrectly mixed green paint to adjust the remaining paint to the correct ratio of blue to yellow by adding more blue or yellow paint.
Answer: C).
