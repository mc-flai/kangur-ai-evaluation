**Reasoning**: To determine the weight of each white ball, we need to analyze the total weights shown in the diagrams and the number of balls in each group.

1. The first balance shows 1 white ball and 1 black ball weighing 6 kg together.
2. The second balance shows 2 white balls and 1 grey ball weighing 14 kg together.
3. The third balance shows 1 black ball and 2 grey balls weighing 10 kg together.

Let:
- w represent the weight of each white ball.
- b represent the weight of each black ball.
- g represent the weight of each grey ball.

From the first balance:
  w + b = 6  (Equation 1)

From the second balance:
  2w + g = 14  (Equation 2)

From the third balance:
  b + 2g = 10  (Equation 3)

We need to solve these equations to find the value of w.

First, solve Equation 1 for b:
  b = 6 - w  (Substitution 1)

Next, substitute b in Equation 3:
  (6 - w) + 2g = 10
  6 - w + 2g = 10
  2g = 4 + w
  g = (4 + w) / 2  (Substitution 2)

Now substitute g in Equation 2:
  2w + (4 + w) / 2 = 14
  4w + 4 + w = 28
  5w + 4 = 28
  5w = 24
  w = 4

Thus, the weight of each white ball is 4 kg.

**Answer**: B)
