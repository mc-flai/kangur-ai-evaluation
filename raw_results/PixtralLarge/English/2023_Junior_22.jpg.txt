To determine the number of ways to read the word "BANANA" from the table, we need to consider the rules provided:

1. We can only move to an adjacent field that shares an edge with the current field.
2. We can use fields several times.

Given the grid:

```
B A B
A N A
B A B
```

Let's analyze the problem step-by-step.

1. **First Letter 'B':**
   - We start with any 'B'. There are 3 'B's in the grid.

2. **Second Letter 'A':**
   - From any 'B', we can move to an adjacent 'A'. Each 'B' has at least one adjacent 'A'.

3. **Third Letter 'N':**
   - From any 'A', we need to move to 'N'. The 'N' is only in the center of the grid. We can reach 'N' from any 'A'.

4. **Fourth Letter 'A':**
   - From 'N', we need to move to 'A'. The 'N' is adjacent to 4 'A's.

5. **Fifth Letter 'N':**
   - From any 'A', we need to move to 'N' again. We can reach 'N' from any 'A'.

6. **Sixth Letter 'A':**
   - From 'N', we need to move to 'A' again. The 'N' is adjacent to 4 'A's.

7. **Seventh Letter 'B':**
   - From any 'A', we need to move to 'B'. Each 'A' has at least one adjacent 'B'.

Given the symmetry and the multiple paths available, we can see that the number of ways to read "BANANA" is significant due to the flexibility of movement and the repetition of letters.

Considering the options provided:
- (A) 56
- (B) 64
- (C) 84
- (D) 112
- (E) 128

The correct answer should account for the multiple paths and the ability to reuse fields. The highest number provided, 128, is the most plausible given the flexibility and repetition allowed.

Reasoning: The grid allows for multiple paths due to the adjacency and reuse of fields, making 128 the most likely number of ways to read "BANANA".

Answer: E).
