**Reasoning**: The question states that Grandma is calling her cat and all her chickens, and after a while, 20 legs are running towards her. We know that both cats and chickens have 4 legs and 2 legs respectively. Since Grandma is calling her cat (which has 4 legs) and all her chickens, we need to account for the cat's legs and then divide the remaining legs by 2 to determine the number of chickens.

Let's denote the number of chickens as \( c \). The cat has 4 legs, so the total number of legs is given by the equation:
\[ 4 + 2c = 20 \]

First, subtract the 4 legs of the cat from 20:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Now, divide the remaining 16 legs by 2 (since each chicken has 2 legs):
\[ 16 / 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, Grandma has 8 chickens.
