**Reasoning**: Kathi starts with a square piece of paper. She folds it twice and then makes two cuts along the lines shown. To determine the number of square pieces of paper resulting from this process, we need to visualize the folding and cutting steps:

1. **First fold**: Folding the square once results in a rectangle.
2. **Second fold**: Folding the rectangle again results in a smaller rectangle.
3. **First cut**: Cutting along the first line splits the smaller rectangle into two smaller rectangles.
4. **Second cut**: Cutting along the second line splits each of the smaller rectangles into two squares.

After unfolding the paper, the original square is divided into four equal squares.

**Answer**: B)
