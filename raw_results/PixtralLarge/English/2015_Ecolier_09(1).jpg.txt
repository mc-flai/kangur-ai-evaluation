**Reasoning**: Luis initially has 7 apples and 2 bananas. He gives 2 apples to Jacob and receives bananas in return. After the exchange, Luis has an equal number of apples and bananas.

Let's denote the number of bananas Luis received from Jacob as x.

Initially:
- Apples: 7
- Bananas: 2

After giving 2 apples to Jacob:
- Apples: 7 - 2 = 5

Now, Luis has 5 apples and (2 + x) bananas.

Since Luis ends up with the same number of apples and bananas, we have:
5 = 2 + x

Solving for x:
x = 5 - 2
x = 3

So, Luis received 3 bananas from Jacob.

**Answer**: B)
