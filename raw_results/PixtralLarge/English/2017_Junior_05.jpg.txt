To determine which picture shows the curve that is described by the center of the wheel as it rolls along a zigzag curve, we need to understand the concept of the path traced by the center of the wheel.

When a wheel rolls along a zigzag path, the center of the wheel will trace a smoother, more continuous curve that averages out the sharp turns of the zigzag. This means the path will have rounded edges rather than sharp corners.

Looking at the options:
- (A) shows a zigzag path with sharp turns and no smoothing.
- (B) shows a path with some smoothing but still has relatively sharp turns.
- (C) shows a more smoothed-out path with rounded edges.
- (D) shows a path with more gradual curves but still has some sharp turns.
- (E) shows a very smooth, continuous curve with no sharp turns.

The correct path should be the one that shows the most smoothing and continuity, which is option (E).

Reasoning: The center of the wheel rolling along a zigzag path will trace a smoother, more continuous curve with rounded edges. Option (E) best represents this smoother path.
Answer: E).
