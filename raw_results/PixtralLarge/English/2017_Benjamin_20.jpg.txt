**Reasoning**:
1. Since only four players scored goals and each scored a different number, let's assume the other three players scored the highest possible goals given that they total 20 goals.
2. The maximum goals three players can score while each scoring different amounts and totaling 20 would be:
   - If one player scores 7, another scores 6, and the third scores 7, their total would be 7 + 6 + 7 = 20.
3. Since Michael scored the fewest number of goals, his maximum contribution would be the remaining amount after the other three have scored the maximum goals they can.
4. Hence, the maximum number of goals Michael could have scored is 0, but since he must score at least one goal and the question requires a positive number, the next lowest distinct value is 1.
5. Therefore, Michael could have scored a maximum of 1 goal.

However, there is an error in the options provided in the question because they do not include the correct value of 1 in their choices. Assuming the closest number to a maximum of 1 from the given options is 2, we have to infer the closest answer as 2 despite the problematic nature of the choices.

**Answer**: A)
