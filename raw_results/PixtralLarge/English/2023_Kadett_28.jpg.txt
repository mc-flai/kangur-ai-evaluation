**Reasoning**: 
1. The problem describes a regular hexagon that is divided into four quadrilaterals and a smaller regular hexagon.
2. We are given the ratio of the area of the dark sections to the area of the small hexagon as 4/3.
3. The question asks for the ratio of the area of the small hexagon to the area of the big hexagon.
4. Let’s denote the area of the small hexagon as A_small and the area of the big hexagon as A_big.
5. The dark sections are part of the big hexagon, and their combined area, plus the area of the small hexagon, equals the area of the big hexagon.
6. Let the area of the dark sections be A_dark. Given that A_dark/A_small = 4/3, we can express A_dark as (4/3) * A_small.
7. The big hexagon’s area can be expressed as A_big = A_dark + A_small = (4/3) * A_small + A_small = (7/3) * A_small.
8. Therefore, the ratio of the area of the small hexagon to the area of the big hexagon is A_small / A_big = A_small / ((7/3) * A_small) = 3/7.
