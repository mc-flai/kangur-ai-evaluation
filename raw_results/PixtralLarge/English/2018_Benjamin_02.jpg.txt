To determine what Peter sees when he looks at the three building blocks from above, we need to visualize the arrangement of the blocks from a top-down perspective.

1. The blocks are arranged in a way that forms an inverted "T" shape when viewed from above.
2. The cylindrical block is placed vertically, and the two rectangular blocks are placed horizontally, with one on each side of the cylinder.

Given the options:
- (A) The blocks are arranged in a straight line.
- (B) The blocks form an "L" shape.
- (C) The blocks form an inverted "T" shape.
- (D) The blocks form a "T" shape.
- (E) The blocks are arranged in a diagonal line.

The correct visualization from above would be an inverted "T" shape because the cylindrical block stands vertically, and the rectangular blocks extend horizontally on either side.

Reasoning: The arrangement of the blocks forms an inverted "T" shape when viewed from above, matching option (C).
Answer: C).
