**Reasoning**:
1. Julia has 9 sweets.
2. Katharina has 17 sweets.
3. To find out how many sweets Katharina needs to give to Julia so that they both have the same amount of sweets, we first calculate the total number of sweets they have together: 9 + 17 = 26 sweets.
4. To find out how many sweets each will have if they share equally, divide the total by 2: 26 / 2 = 13 sweets.
5. Julia currently has 9 sweets, so she needs 13 - 9 = 4 more sweets to have 13 sweets.
6. Therefore, Katharina needs to give Julia 4 sweets.
