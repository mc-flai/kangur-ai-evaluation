1. **Analyze the given tangram pieces**: The original square is divided into seven pieces to form the kangaroo. The pieces visible in the kangaroo are: two large right triangles, one square, one parallelogram, and two small triangles.

2. **Identify missing piece**: By comparing the rearranged kangaroo with the original square, we notice that one of the smaller triangles is missing from the kangaroo.

3. **Match with the options**: From the provided options (A, B, C, D, E), we need to identify which one represents the missing smaller triangle.

- Option A: A parallelogram (This is already present in the kangaroo).
- Option B: A small right triangle (This is not visible in the kangaroo).
- Option C: A rhombus (This is not a part of the original tangram pieces).
- Option D: A small isosceles triangle (This is already present in the kangaroo).
- Option E: Another small right triangle (This one is smaller and matches the missing piece).

4. **Conclusion**: The missing piece is the small right triangle, which corresponds to option E.

Reasoning: The missing piece from the original tangram square needed to complete the kangaroo is a small right triangle. By comparing the pieces, we can identify that the corresponding missing piece is option E.
Answer: E).
