**Reasoning**: 
1. The path DEFB lies within the square ABCD, and we are given the lengths DE = 5, EF = 1, and FB = 2.
2. The side length of the square ABCD can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle DEF (where DE is perpendicular to EF) and then adding the length FB.
3. First, calculate the hypotenuse DF using the Pythagorean theorem:
   
   DF = sqrt(DE^2 + EF^2) = sqrt(5^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(25 + 1) = sqrt(26)
   
4. Next, we need to consider the right triangle DFB (where FB is perpendicular to DF). The side length of the square will be the hypotenuse of this triangle, calculated as:
   
   DF = BF = 2
  
   Using Pythagorean theorem again:
   
   Side length = sqrt(DF^2 + FB^2) = sqrt(26 + 4) = sqrt(30)
   
5. The correct answer must be the one that matches sqrt(30). Among the options provided:
   
   - A) 3√2 = sqrt(18)
   - B) 2√7 = sqrt(28)
   - C) 11/2 = 5.5
   - D) 5√2 = sqrt(50)
   - E) another value
   
   The closest value to our calculated result, sqrt(30), is option D) 5√2.

**Answer**: D)
