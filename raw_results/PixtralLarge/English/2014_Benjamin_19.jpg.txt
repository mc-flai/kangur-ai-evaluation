**Reasoning**:
1. The initial 3x3x3 cube consists of 27 small cubes.
2. When we observe the cube from the right, from above, and from the front, we see a 3x3 grid with some cubes missing. 
3. The visible grid shows 9 cubes in total.
4. This means in each of these views, we can see 9 out of 27 cubes.
5. Since the small cubes are removed, we need to determine how many are missing.
6. The total number of cubes in a 3x3x3 cube is 27.
7. The visible cubes (from one face) are 9.
8. Thus, the number of removed cubes can be calculated as follows: 27 (total cubes) - 9 (visible cubes) = 18 (removed cubes).
9. However, since each face shows a missing center cube, this cube is counted three times in the removal count. Therefore, we need to adjust:
10. 18 (total removed count) - 2 (overlapping count) = 16 removed cubes.
11. The image shows 3 faces with a missing center cube, showing 6 cubes are missing in total.

**Answer**: D).
