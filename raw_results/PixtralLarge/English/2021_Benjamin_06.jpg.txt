The question asks for the measurement of the circumference of a cylinder.

The image shows a measuring tape wrapped around a cylinder, with one of the numbers covered by a question mark. The visible numbers on the tape are 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31.

To determine the number that should be at the place shown by the question mark, we need to identify the missing number in the sequence. The sequence is increasing by 1, and the missing number should logically be 27.

**Reasoning:** Based on the sequence of numbers on the measuring tape (25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31), the missing number that should be at the place of the question mark is 27. Among the provided options, 27 falls between 26 and 28, which corresponds to option C (69).

**Answer:** C)
