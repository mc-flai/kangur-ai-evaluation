To determine how many of the patterns shown below Robert can make using the given tiles, we need to analyze each pattern individually:

- **Pattern (A) 1**: This pattern consists of one tile, which is one of the given tiles. Robert can make this pattern.
- **Pattern (B) 2**: This pattern consists of two tiles, one green and one pink. Robert can make this pattern by arranging the tiles accordingly.
- **Pattern (C) 3**: This pattern consists of three tiles in a specific arrangement. Robert can make this pattern by placing one green tile and two pink tiles as shown.
- **Pattern (D) 4**: This pattern consists of four tiles, two green and two pink. Robert can make this pattern by arranging them in the given layout.
- **Pattern (E) 5**: This pattern consists of five tiles, three green and two pink. Robert can make this pattern by arranging the tiles as shown.

Since Robert can make all five patterns with the given tiles, the correct answer is the one that represents all the patterns he can make.
