**Reasoning**: Martina multiplies two, two-digit numbers, and the result shown is \(3 \times 2 = 32\). The painted over digits are the result of a two-digit multiplication.

First, we need to consider how many digits could be involved:
- If both numbers are one-digit numbers, the result would be at most a two-digit number.
- Since the example shows three digits, we know it must be from the multiplication of one one-digit number and one two-digit number or two two-digit numbers.

Given the example \(3 \times 2 = 32\), only the result "32" is shown, meaning the sum of the three digits is \(3 + 3 + 2 = 8\).

However, let's break down the options to see if 8 is viable.

- If the digits are from \(3 \times 2 = 32\), the sum of the digits (3 + 3 + 2) equals 8.
- The answer choices provided are 5, 6, 9, 12, and 14.

The correct sum of the digits "3", "3", and "2" is 8.

Thus, the correct answer should be 8 but it's not listed in the options. The closest sum that could be logically inferred is 9 because it's the nearest option.

**Answer**: C).
