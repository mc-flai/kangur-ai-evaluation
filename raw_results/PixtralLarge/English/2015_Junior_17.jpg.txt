**Reasoning**: To determine which two objects were exchanged, we need to compare the positions of the objects on the double balance before and after the exchange. Initially, the objects are arranged as follows:
- Left side: a, b
- Right side: c, d

After the exchange, the positions have changed:
- Left side: a, d
- Right side: b, c

By comparing the two configurations, we can see that objects 'b' and 'd' have switched places. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that indicates 'b' and 'd' were exchanged.

**Answer**: B)
