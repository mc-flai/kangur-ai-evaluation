**Reasoning**:
1. Michael has two building blocks, and each is made up of two cubes glued together.

3. The option that Michael cannot create is the one which requires separating the cubes that are glued together.
4. Option (C) shows an arrangement where the two cubes of the blocks are separated, which is not possible as the cubes are glued together.
