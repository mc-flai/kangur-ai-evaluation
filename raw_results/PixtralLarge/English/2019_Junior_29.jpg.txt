**Reasoning**:
1. Given the numbers \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are three-digit numbers, where the first digit is equal to the last one.
2. The relationships between the numbers are:
    - \( b = 2a + 1 \)
    - \( c = 2b + 1 \)
3. Since \( a \) is a three-digit number, it must be in the range from 100 to 999.
4. For \( b \) to also be a three-digit number, we must have \( b = 2a + 1 \) within the range 100 to 999.
5. Therefore, \( 2a + 1 \) must be a three-digit number, so:
    \[ 
    100 \le 2a + 1 \le 999 \implies 99 \le 2a \le 998 \implies 50 \le a \le 499 
    \]
6. Additionally, for \( c = 2b + 1 \) to be a three-digit number:
    \[ 
    100 \le 2b + 1 \le 999 \implies 99 \le 2b \le 998 \implies 50 \le b \le 499 
    \]
7. Substituting \( b = 2a + 1 \) in the inequality for \( b \):
    \[ 
    50 \le 2a + 1 \le 499 \implies 49 \le 2a \le 498 \implies 25 \le a \le 249 
    \]
8. Therefore, the value of \( a \) must be in the range from 100 to 499.
9. Additionally, the first digit and the last digit of \( a \) are the same, limiting the possible values of \( a \).
10. Hence, the possible values of \( a \) are: 101, 202, 303, 404, 505, 606, 707, 808, 909 (nine values).

**Answer**: E) more than 3.
