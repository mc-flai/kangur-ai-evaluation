**Reasoning**: To determine which clock shows the correct time, we need to consider the information provided:

- One clock is one hour ahead.
- Another clock is one hour late.
- One clock is correct.
- Two clocks have stopped working.

Since two clocks have stopped, they are not showing the correct time. We need to focus on the three remaining clocks.

Let's look at each of the clocks:

- Clock A: 12:00 (This could be the correct time, one hour ahead, or one hour late.)
- Clock B: 1:00 (This could be the correct time or one hour ahead.)
- Clock C: 11:00 (This could be the correct time or one hour late.)
- Clock D: 10:10 (This clock has stopped working, as indicated by the time.)
- Clock E: 12:50 (This clock has stopped working, as indicated by the time.)

We can eliminate Clocks D and E because they are not showing the correct time.

Now, we need to determine which of the remaining clocks (A, B, and C) shows the correct time. If Clock A is the correct time (12:00), then Clock B would be one hour ahead (1:00) and Clock C would be one hour late (11:00), which fits the conditions given.

**Answer**: A
