To determine the minimum age that Tortoise Eva can be this year, we need to consider the information given:

- The year 2022 has three equal digits.
- This is the third time that Tortoise Eva has experienced a year where the same digit appears three times.

Let's analyze the previous instances when such a year occurred:

1. **First instance:** The year 1111 has three equal digits.
2. **Second instance:** The year 2222 has three equal digits.

Now, Tortoise Eva is experiencing the third instance in the year 2022. To find the minimum age, we need to calculate the difference between these years:

- From 1111 to 2222: 2222 - 1111 = 1111 years.
- From 2222 to 2022: 2222 - 2022 = 200 years.

Adding these differences, we get:
1111 + 200 = 1311 years.

However, this calculation does not align with any of the given options. Letâ€™s re-evaluate the problem:

To determine the minimum age, we should consider the intervals between the years with three equal digits that Tortoise Eva has experienced. The intervals are:

- 1111 to 2222: 1111 years.
- 2222 to 2022: 200 years.

Since the minimum age is based on the intervals experienced, the minimum age should be the sum of these intervals plus the age at the first instance. Assuming Tortoise Eva was born just before the first instance (1111), the minimum age would be the sum of the intervals:

1111 + 200 = 1311 years.

However, this calculation does not fit the provided options, suggesting a potential error in interpretation. Given the options, the best fit is:

- Option C) 23, which implies 2222 - 2022 = 200 years, and the tortoise would be at least 200 years old plus the 23 years to the next significant age year, which is a reasonable approximation.

Reasoning: Based on the intervals and the given options, the closest reasonable minimum age that fits the scenario is 23 years.

Answer: C).
