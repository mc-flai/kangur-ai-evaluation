**Reasoning**: 
The problem asks for the smallest amount of cubes Irene may have used to make the assembly. To determine this, we need to account for all the visible cubes from both the top view and the side view.

1. **Count the cubes from the top view (left image)**:
   - There are 7 visible cubes.

2. **Count the cubes from the side view (right image)**:
   - There are 5 visible cubes.

3. **Identify overlapping cubes**:
   - The tallest column in the side view has 4 cubes vertically aligned. This suggests that at least 3 of these cubes are likely to overlap with the cubes visible from the top view.
   - We need to ensure that the structure respects the constraints provided by both views.

4. **Calculate the total minimum cubes**:
   - From the top view, there are 7 cubes.
   - From the side view, there are 5 cubes.
   - The overlapping cubes are at least 3 from the tallest column.
   - Therefore, the smallest number of cubes is: 7 (top view) + 5 (side view) - 3 (overlap) = 9 cubes.

Considering that there must be at least 9 cubes to satisfy both views, the smallest number that fits this condition and is provided in the options is 10 (since 9 is not an option).

**Answer**: A)
