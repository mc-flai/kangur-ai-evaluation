To determine which pattern can be made with two building blocks without overlap, we need to examine each option closely.

1. **Option (A)**: This pattern shows two building blocks overlapping.
2. **Option (B)**: This pattern also has overlapping building blocks.
3. **Option (C)**: This pattern has overlapping building blocks.
4. **Option (D)**: This pattern shows two building blocks that can be positioned without overlap, forming an L-shape.
5. **Option (E)**: This pattern has overlapping building blocks.

From the analysis, only **Option (D)** has no overlapping blocks and can be made with two building blocks without overlap.

Reasoning: Only pattern (D) allows two building blocks to be used without any overlap. All other options show overlapping blocks.
Answer: D).
