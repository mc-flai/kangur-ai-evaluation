**Reasoning**:
Peter needs to color a 3x3 grid such that each row, column, and both diagonals have three different colors. To determine the smallest number of colors needed, consider the following:

1. If Peter uses only 3 colors, he can color the grid as follows:
   ```
   1 2 3
   2 3 1
   3 1 2
   ```
   Here, each row, column, and diagonal contains three different colors.

2. If Peter uses only 2 colors, it is impossible to satisfy the condition that each row, column, and diagonal has three different colors because there are not enough colors to make all three different in each of these lines.

Therefore, the smallest number of colors Peter can use to satisfy the problem's conditions is 3.
