**Reasoning**:
1. First, we need to determine how many kangaroo-weeks are in a kangaroo-year.
2. Each kangaroo-year has 20 kangaroo-months.
3. Each kangaroo-month has 6 kangaroo-weeks.
4. To find the total number of kangaroo-weeks in a kangaroo-year, multiply the number of kangaroo-months by the number of kangaroo-weeks in each month:
   \[
   20 \text{ kangaroo-months} \times 6 \text{ kangaroo-weeks per month} = 120 \text{ kangaroo-weeks}
   \]
5. Since we need to find the number of kangaroo-weeks in a quarter of a kangaroo-year, divide the total number of kangaroo-weeks in a year by 4:
   \[
   \frac{120 \text{ kangaroo-weeks}}{4} = 30 \text{ kangaroo-weeks}
   \]

**Answer**: B)
