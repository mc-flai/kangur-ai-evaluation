**Reasoning**: Let's denote Claudia's spending as C. According to the problem, Bettina spends 85% less than Claudia, which means Bettina spends 15% of what Claudia spends. Similarly, Anna spends 60% more than Claudia, meaning Anna spends 160% of what Claudia spends.

So we can set up the following equations:

- Bettina's spending = 0.15C
- Anna's spending = 1.60C

The total spending by all three is given as 55 €, so:

C + 0.15C + 1.60C = 55 €
2.75C = 55 €
C = 55 / 2.75
C = 20 €

Now we can find Anna's spending:
Anna's spending = 1.60 * 20 € = 32 €

**Answer**: E)
