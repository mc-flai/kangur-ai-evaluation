**Reasoning**:
1. The given code for the word "PIZZA" is A2A4C1C1B2.
2. By examining the encoding board, we can determine the code for each letter:
   - P -> A2
   - I -> A4
   - Z -> C1
   - Z -> C1
   - A -> B2
3. We now need to decode the word using the code B3B2C4D2.
4. Using the encoding board, we translate each part of the code:
   - B3 -> M
   - B2 -> A
   - C4 -> T
   - D2 -> H
5. Combining these letters, we get the word "MATH."

**Answer**: E)
