**Reasoning**: To determine how far Viola needs to jump to increase her mean to 3.82 meters, we can use the formula for the mean:

\[ \text{mean} = \frac{\text{sum of jumps}}{\text{number of jumps}} \]

Currently, the sum of Viola's jumps is:

\[ 3.80 \, \text{m} \times 6 + 3.99 \, \text{m} = 22.80 \, \text{m} + 3.99 \, \text{m} = 26.79 \, \text{m} \]

The number of jumps is 7. To find the new mean (3.82 meters), we set up the equation:

\[ 3.82 \, \text{m} = \frac{26.79 \, \text{m} + x}{8} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 3.82 \times 8 = 26.79 + x \]
\[ 30.56 = 26.79 + x \]
\[ x = 30.56 - 26.79 \]
\[ x = 3.77 \, \text{m} \]

However, the question asks how far she needs to jump to increase the mean to 3.82 meters, which means \( x \) should be greater than 3.82 meters. So we should round up to the nearest option.

Comparing \( x = 3.77 \, \text{m} \) with the given options, the closest and the correct option that is greater than 3.82 meters is 4.00 meters.

**Answer**: B) 4.00 m
