To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of AD, which is the straight-line distance between the points A and D. Since AD is a straight line passing through the centers of the two touching semicircles, we can break it down into segments that are easier to work with.

1. **Identify Center and Radii**:
   - Let O1 be the center of the semicircle with diameter AB.
   - Let O2 be the center of the semicircle with diameter CD.
   - The radius of each semicircle is 1.

2. **Length of Segments**:
   - The length AO1 is equal to the radius of the semicircle AB, which is 1.
   - The length O1C is the distance between the centers of the two semicircles, which is equal to the sum of their radii, which is 1 + 1 = 2.
   - The length O2D is equal to the radius of the semicircle CD, which is 1.

3. **Total Length AD**:
   - AD = AO1 + O1C + O2D
   - AD = 1 + 2 + 1
   - AD = 4

4. **Square of Length AD**:
   - (AD)^2 = 4^2 = 16

Reasoning: We used the geometry of the semicircles and the properties of their centers and radii to calculate the total length AD and subsequently its square.

Answer: A) 16.
