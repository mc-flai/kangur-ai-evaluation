**Reasoning**:
1. The number of cookies in the box is fewer than 50.
2. The cookies can be divided evenly between 2, 3, or 4 children. This means the number of cookies must be a common multiple of 2, 3, and 4.
3. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, and 4 is 12. Therefore, the number of cookies must be a multiple of 12.
4. The multiples of 12 that are fewer than 50 are: 12, 24, 36, and 48.
5. The problem states that the cookies cannot be divided evenly between 7 children because 6 more cookies would be needed. Therefore, we need to check which of the multiples of 12, when increased by 6, is divisible by 7.
6. Checking each multiple:
   - 12 + 6 = 18, which is not divisible by 7.
   - 24 + 6 = 30, which is not divisible by 7.
   - 36 + 6 = 42, which is divisible by 7.
   - 48 + 6 = 54, which is not divisible by 7.
7. Therefore, the number of cookies in the box must be 36.
