**Reasoning**: 
- There are 14 little tables in the classroom.
- Each table has two chairs, meaning each table can seat two children.
- Each boy sits with a girl at the same table.
- There are four girls who do not sit with a boy. 

First, find the number of tables where boys and girls are sitting together:
- Since each table has two chairs, and each boy sits with a girl on the same table, there are 14 tables where one chair is occupied by a boy and the other chair is occupied by a girl. This means there are 14 girls sitting with boys.

Next, include the four girls who do not sit with a boy:
- The total number of girls in the class is the sum of the girls sitting with boys and the girls who do not sit with a boy.
- So, the total number of girls is 14 (sitting with boys) + 4 (not sitting with boys) = 18 girls.

**Answer**: E) 16 is incorrect since the correct calculation yields 18 girls. None of the provided options (6, 10, 12, 14, 16) match this result. Since there is no correct option provided, the closest answer based on the options given is the highest number, which is 16. However, logically, it should be option E) 16.
