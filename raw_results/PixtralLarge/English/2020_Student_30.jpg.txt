To analyze question 30 and determine Carlaâ€™s favorite figure:

1. **Understand the given information**:
    - Adam knows the shape of Carla's favorite figure.
    - Bruna knows the color of Carla's favorite figure.
    - Adam initially doesn't know what Carla's favorite figure is.
    - Bruna initially doesn't know what Carla's favorite figure is, but after Adam says he knows too, Bruna determines Carla's favorite figure.

2. **Deduce the implications**:
    - Since Bruna knows the color of Carla's favorite figure and can determine the figure after Adam says he knows too, it implies that there must be only one figure of that color left.
    - This means that the favorite figure must be the only one of its color among the options.

3. **Examine the figures**:
    - The figures provided are:
        - (A) Pink circle
        - (B) Green square
        - (C) Green star
        - (D) White square
        - (E) Pink triangle
    - We need to identify the figure that has a unique color.

4. **Identify unique colors**:
    - Pink: Figures (A) and (E)
    - Green: Figures (B) and (C)
    - White: Figure (D)
    - Since only figure (D) is white, it is the unique figure by color.

Reasoning: The only figure that has a unique color is (D), which is white. Given the information, this must be Carla's favorite figure.

Answer: D).
