**Reasoning**: The problem states that the sums of the numbers in each box are the same. Let's denote the sum of the numbers in the first box as S1 and the sum of the numbers in the second box as S2. We are given the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. We need to determine which number must be in the box with the number 4.

Let's assume that the sum of the numbers in each box is S. If 4 is in one of the boxes, then we need to determine the sum of the remaining numbers to ensure the sums are equal.

First, calculate the total sum of all the given numbers: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20.

Since there are two boxes, each box should have a sum of S = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now, we need to find which number, when combined with 4, gives a sum of 10. Here are the possible combinations:
- If 4 is combined with 6, the sum is 4 + 6 = 10.

No other single number from the given set can be combined with 4 to give a sum of 10. Therefore, the number 6 must be in the box with the number 4.

**Answer**: D).
