To determine which number Mosif needs to change, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row and each column is the same. Let's calculate the sums for each row and column:

Current sums:
- Row 1: 9 + 1 + 5 = 15
- Row 2: 3 + 7 + 6 = 16
- Row 3: 4 + 7 + 4 = 15

- Column 1: 9 + 3 + 4 = 16
- Column 2: 1 + 7 + 7 = 15
- Column 3: 5 + 6 + 4 = 15

All rows and columns should sum to the same value. The sums are not equal because Row 1 and Column 2 both sum to 15, while Row 2 and Column 1 sum to 16.

To make all sums equal, we need to adjust one number so that all rows and columns sum to the same value. Since Row 2 and Column 1 sum to 16, it makes sense to adjust a number in Row 2 or Column 1 to make the sums equal to 15.

Looking at the options:
(A) 1 - Changing 1 does not affect the sum significantly as 1 is in Row 1, which already sums to 15.
(B) 3 - Changing 3 does not seem necessary as it is in Row 2 and changing it might not align the sums correctly.
(C) one of the two 4s - Changing one of the 4s might work but it's not the best option since there are two 4s and changing one might not balance the sums correctly.
(D) 5 - Changing 5 does not affect the sum significantly as 5 is in Row 1, which already sums to 15.
(E) one of the two 7s - Changing one of the 7s in Row 2 or Column 1 to 6 will make all sums equal to 15.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Reasoning: Changing one of the two 7s to 6 will make all the row and column sums equal to 15.
Answer: E).
