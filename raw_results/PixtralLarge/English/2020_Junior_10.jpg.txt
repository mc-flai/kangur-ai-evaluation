To solve question 10, we need to determine the ratio between the blue and yellow parts of the kite. Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Understand the Kite Structure**: The kite is made of two diagonals that are perpendicular to each other. The blue part is formed by the central square created by these diagonals, and the yellow part consists of the triangles outside this square.

2. **Identify the Areas**:
   - The blue part is a square.
   - The yellow parts are triangles.

3. **Calculate the Areas**:
   - Let's assume the length of each piece of bamboo used for the diagonals is \( l \).
   - The area of the blue square can be calculated as \( l^2 \).
   - The area of each yellow triangle is \( \frac{1}{2} \times l \times l = \frac{l^2}{2} \).
   - Since there are four yellow triangles, the total area of the yellow parts is \( 4 \times \frac{l^2}{2} = 2l^2 \).

4. **Determine the Ratio**:
   - The ratio of the blue area to the yellow area is \( \frac{l^2}{2l^2} = \frac{1}{2} \).

Therefore, the ratio between the blue and yellow parts of the kite is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Reasoning: The blue part is a square, and the yellow parts are four triangles. The ratio of their areas is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Answer: A).
