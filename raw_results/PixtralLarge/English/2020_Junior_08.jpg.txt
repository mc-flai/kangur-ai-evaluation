**Reasoning**:
1. Each square has a side length of 1 cm.
2. The perimeter of one square is 4 cm (since each square has four sides).
3. We need to find the figure with the largest perimeter formed by nine such squares.

To analyze the potential arrangements:
- The smallest perimeter of a 3x3 square grid is 12 cm (since the grid has 12 sides forming the outer boundary).
- To maximize the perimeter, the figure should be as elongated as possible, maximizing the number of edges on the outer boundary.

By arranging the squares in a line (like a single row of 9 squares), the perimeter would be:
- 3 x 2 (for the ends) + 9 x 2 (for the sides) = 6 + 18 = 24 cm.

However, since the answer choices are limited to 20 cm, we consider the second-best configuration which would be a "T" shaped arrangement or similar configurations that are feasible.

From the provided answers, a "T" shaped arrangement with a stem of two squares and a top of three squares has a perimeter of 20 cm, as shown in the example image.

**Answer**: E).
