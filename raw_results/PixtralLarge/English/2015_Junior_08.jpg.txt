**Reasoning**:
- A number is a square number if it can be expressed as \(n^2\) for some integer \(n\).
- A number is a cubic number if it can be expressed as \(m^3\) for some integer \(m\).

Let's analyze each option:

(A) \(6^{13}\):
- \(6^{13} = (6^6)^2 \cdot 6\). Although it contains a square component, the \(6\) outside the square makes it neither a square nor a cubic number.

(B) \(5^{12}\):
- \(5^{12} = (5^6)^2\). This is a square number (\((5^6)^2\)).

(C) \(4^{11}\):
- \(4^{11} = (2^2)^{11} = 2^{22}\). This is neither a square number nor a cubic number.

(D) \(3^{10}\):
- \(3^{10} = (3^5)^2\). This is a square number (\((3^5)^2\)).

(E) \(2^9\):
- \(2^9 = (2^3)^3\). This is a cubic number (\((2^3)^3\)).

So, the number which is neither a square nor a cubic number is \(4^{11}\).

**Answer**: C).
