**Reasoning**: 
To solve this problem, we need to identify which single-digit positive whole numbers can be combined to form the sum of 10. 

The possible pairs of single-digit numbers that add up to 10 are:
- 1 + 9 = 10
- 2 + 8 = 10
- 3 + 7 = 10
- 4 + 6 = 10
- 5 + 5 = 10 (However, this uses the same digit twice, and the problem specifies that the numbers must be different)

Given that Sven writes five different single-digit positive whole numbers on the board, none of which can be combined to make 10, the only possible number to exclude is 5. 

By excluding 5, we ensure that no two numbers on the board can sum to 10.

**Answer**: E).
