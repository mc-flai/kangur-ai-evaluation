To determine which sentence fits the picture, we need to count the number of circles, squares, and triangles in the image.

Let's count each shape:
- Circles: There are 3 circles.
- Squares: There are 2 squares.
- Triangles: There is 1 triangle.

Now, we compare these counts to each of the given statements:

(A) There are equally many circles as squares.
- This is false because there are 3 circles and 2 squares.

(B) There are fewer circles than triangles.
- This is false because there are 3 circles and 1 triangle.

(C) There are twice as many circles as triangles.
- This is true because 3 circles is twice 1 triangle.

(D) There are more squares than triangles.
- This is true because there are 2 squares and 1 triangle.

(E) There are two more triangles than circles.
- This is false because there are 3 circles and 1 triangle.

Since option (C) is the only statement that is true, the correct answer is:

Reasoning: The image shows 3 circles, 2 squares, and 1 triangle. Among the statements, only option (C) correctly describes the relationship between the number of circles and triangles.
Answer: C).
