**Reasoning:**
1. The sum of the digits in each row is given on the right-hand side of the row.
2. Consider the first row where the sum of the digits is 15.
3. The first shape in the first row represents the digit 2, and the third shape represents the digit 1 (since the sum of the first two shapes must be 11 to reach a total of 15 when the third shape is added).
4. Now consider the third row where the sum is 16.
5. The first shape in the third row is 2 (same as the first row).
6. The third shape in the third row is 1 (same as the first row).
7. Therefore, the remaining shape (the star) must be 13 (16 - 2 - 1).
8. Hence, the star stands for the digit 4.

**Answer:** C)
