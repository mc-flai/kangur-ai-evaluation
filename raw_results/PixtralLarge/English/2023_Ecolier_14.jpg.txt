The problem states that there are 6 beavers and 2 kangaroos standing in a specific order. We are told that of three animals in a row, there is always exactly one kangaroo. This means that the kangaroos must be positioned such that there are two beavers between them.

Positions 1, 2, and 3 will have exactly one kangaroo, and positions 6, 7, and 8 will have exactly one kangaroo. To meet the condition that there is always exactly one kangaroo in any group of three animals, the kangaroos must be in positions 3 and 6.

Reasoning:
1. The problem specifies that among any three animals in a row, there is exactly one kangaroo.
2. To satisfy this condition, the kangaroos must be separated by at least two beavers.
3. Therefore, if one kangaroo is at position 3, the next kangaroo must be at position 6 to ensure that any group of three animals in a row has exactly one kangaroo.

Answer: C)
