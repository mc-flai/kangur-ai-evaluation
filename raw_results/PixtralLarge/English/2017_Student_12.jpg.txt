To determine which of the given numbers is the biggest, we need to consider the properties of \( p \) and \( q \):

- \( p \) is smaller than 1.
- \( q \) is greater than 1.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) \( p \times q \): Since \( p \) is less than 1 and \( q \) is greater than 1, the product \( p \times q \) will be less than \( q \) because multiplying a number less than 1 by a number greater than 1 will result in a number that is smaller than the larger number.

(B) \( p + q \): The sum \( p + q \) will be greater than \( p \) but also greater than 1 since \( q \) is greater than 1. This sum is likely to be greater than \( q \) since \( q \) is greater than 1 and \( p \) is positive.

(C) \( \frac{p}{q} \): This fraction will be less than 1 because \( p \) is less than 1 and \( q \) is greater than 1.

(D) \( p \): This is less than 1 by definition.

(E) \( q \): This is greater than 1 by definition.

Given these analyses, the largest number among the options will be \( p + q \) because both \( p \) and \( q \) are positive and \( q \) is greater than 1, making their sum larger than any individual number or product involving \( p \).

Reasoning: Since \( p \) is smaller than 1 and \( q \) is greater than 1, the sum \( p + q \) will be the largest number among the given options.
