**Reasoning**: The 4x4 grid without a little square has 16 - 1 = 15 squares. It is divided into three equal pieces, meaning each piece must have 15 / 3 = 5 squares.

- (A) and (B) each have 6 squares.
- (C) has 5 squares but is not a valid piece since it cannot fit in the 4x4 grid with the missing square.
- (D) has 5 squares and fits within the 4x4 grid as a valid piece.
- (E) has 5 squares but is not a valid piece since it cannot fit in the 4x4 grid with the missing square.

Therefore, the correct choice is (D).

**Answer**: D)
