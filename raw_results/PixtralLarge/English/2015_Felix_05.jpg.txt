**Reasoning**: The question asks which of the long strips is the shortest. Since Florian has 10 equally long metal strips that he bolts together in pairs, the resulting strips will be of different lengths depending on the position of the bolts.

- Strip A appears to have an overlap of 2 holes, resulting in a slightly shorter length compared to others.
- Strip B has an overlap of 3 holes, making it shorter than C, D, and E.
- Strip C has an overlap of 2 holes, similar to A.
- Strip D has an overlap of 1 hole, making it longer than A, B, and C.
- Strip E has no overlap, making it the longest.

Comparing the overlaps, Strip B has the most significant overlap (3 holes), which makes it the shortest among all the options provided.

**Answer**: B
