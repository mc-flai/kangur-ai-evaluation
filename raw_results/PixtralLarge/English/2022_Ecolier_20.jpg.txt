The question asks which hexagon fits in the middle so that one can travel from house A to houses B and E, but not to house D.

**Reasoning**:
1. Identify the requirement: The hexagon must allow travel from house A to houses B and E, but not to house D.
2. Analyze each hexagon:
   - Hexagon 1: Connects A to E and B, but also connects to D.
   - Hexagon 2: Connects A to B, but does not connect to E or D.
   - Hexagon 3: Connects A to B, but also connects to D.
   - Hexagon 4: Connects A to B and E, but does not connect to D.
   - Hexagon 5: Connects A to B, but also connects to D.
3. Based on this analysis, only Hexagon 4 satisfies the requirement of connecting A to B and E while not connecting to D.

**Answer**: D)
