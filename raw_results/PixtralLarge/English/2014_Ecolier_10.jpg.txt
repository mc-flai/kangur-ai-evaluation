To determine what the solid made from 8 identical cubes looks like when viewed from above, we need to visualize each configuration and compare it with the options provided.

First, identify the overall structure of the solid in the diagram. It appears to be a combination of cubes stacked in a specific manner. We can break down the solid into three layers:

1. Bottom Layer: 3 cubes aligned horizontally.
2. Middle Layer: 2 cubes aligned horizontally, but shifted to the right.
3. Top Layer: 3 cubes aligned horizontally, with two cubes stacked vertically on top of the middle layer cubes.

Now, let's visualize each layer from above:

1. Bottom Layer: Appears as a horizontal row of 3 cubes.
2. Middle Layer: Appears as a horizontal row of 2 cubes but shifted.
3. Top Layer: Appears as a horizontal row of 3 cubes.

When viewed from above, the middle layer is partially obstructed by the top layer. The solid should thus show a slightly displaced arrangement of cubes.

Comparing this visualization with the options:
- (A) shows an L-shape.
- (B) shows a T-shape.
- (C) shows a right-angle.
- (D) shows a displaced T-shape.
- (E) shows a zigzag pattern.

The correct view from above should show a T-shape, considering the middle layer's displacement.

Reasoning: By visualizing the solid's stacking and comparing it to the options, option B, which shows a T-shape, best matches the described arrangement.

Answer: B).
