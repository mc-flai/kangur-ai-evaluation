**Reasoning**:
The polynomial in question is of degree five and has all integer zeros. The polynomial can be expressed in the form:

\[ P(x) = (x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3)(x - r_4)(x - r_5) \]

where \( r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, \) and \( r_5 \) are the integer roots. To determine the highest power of \( x - 1 \) that divides this polynomial, we need to consider how many of these roots are equal to 1. Since \( x - 1 \) appears as a factor for each root that is equal to 1, the highest power of \( x - 1 \) is determined by the number of times 1 appears as a root.

Given that the polynomial is partly illegible but known to have all integer zeros, the highest power of \( x - 1 \) that divides the polynomial will be the number of times 1 is a root. Since none of the roots are visible and only the form is known, we assume there are 4 distinct roots equal to 1 based on the visible portion of the polynomial.

**Answer**: D).
