**Reasoning**:
1. The staircase has 2023 steps, with every third step colored in black.
2. To find the number of black steps, we divide the total number of steps by 3:
   \[
   \frac{2023}{3} \approx 674.33
   \]
   Since we can't have a fraction of a step, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 674. However, since the sequence includes the first step, we need to count from the first black step, which is step 3. Thus, the total number of black steps is:
   \[
   674 + 1 = 675
   \]
3. Anita can start with either foot and then steps down alternately, meaning each foot will land on half of the black steps.
4. Therefore, each foot will land on:
   \[
   \frac{675}{2} = 337.5
   \]
   Since she can't step on half a step, we need to consider the minimum integer number of black steps she will definitely step on with her right foot:
   \[
   337
   \]
