To determine the measure of the angle AOB, we need to use the properties of the geometric configuration described in the problem. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the Geometry**:
   - We have two circles that are tangent to each other and to two sides of a square.
   - The points A and B are points of tangency on the square, and O is the point where the circles are tangent to each other.

2. **Understand the Tangency**:
   - Since the circles are tangent at point O and both tangent to the sides of the square at points A and B, the line segments OA and OB are radii of the circles and are perpendicular to the sides of the square.

3. **Analyze the Angles**:
   - The angle AOB is formed by the radii of the two circles.
   - Since A and B are on the sides of the square, the angle between the radii OA and OB is influenced by the geometry of the square.

4. **Calculate the Angle**:
   - The angle between two adjacent sides of a square is 90 degrees.
   - Since OA and OB are radii perpendicular to the sides of the square, the angle AOB is twice the angle between one radius and the side of the square (which is 45 degrees).

5. **Determine the Measure**:
   - Therefore, the angle AOB is 135 degrees (90 degrees + 45 degrees).

Reasoning: The angle AOB is formed by the radii of the circles tangent to the sides of the square. The angle between two adjacent sides of a square is 90 degrees, and the angle between the radius and the side of the square is 45 degrees. Thus, the total angle AOB is 135 degrees.

Answer: E).
