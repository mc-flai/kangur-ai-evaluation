To determine the largest remainder Maria has noted down, we need to understand the sequence of remainders produced when she divides 2015 by successive integers starting from 1 up to and including 1000. 

1. **Dividing 2015 by 1**:
    \[
    2015 \div 1 = 2015 \quad \text{Remainder: } 0
    \]

2. **Dividing 2015 by 2**:
    \[
    2015 \div 2 = 1007 \quad \text{Remainder: } 1
    \]

3. **Dividing 2015 by 3**:
    \[
    2015 \div 3 = 671 \quad \text{Remainder: } 2
    \]

We continue this process up to dividing by 1000. Notice that for any integer \( n \), the remainder when dividing by \( n \) can never be greater than \( n-1 \). Therefore, the remainders we get will range from 0 to \( n-1 \).

Given this property, the largest possible remainder will be when dividing by the largest divisor, which is 1000.

4. **Dividing 2015 by 1000**:
    \[
    2015 \div 1000 = 2 \quad \text{Remainder: } 15
    \]

The largest remainder we can get from dividing 2015 by any integer from 1 to 1000 will be less than or equal to 1000. Since the remainder when dividing by 1000 is 15, we check the remainder for the next largest divisor, 1001.

5. **Dividing 2015 by 1001**:
    \[
    2015 \div 1001 = 2 \quad \text{Remainder: } 13
    \]

Continuing this analysis shows that the remainders do not exceed 1007.

Therefore, the largest remainder Maria has noted down is 1007.

Reasoning: The largest remainder when dividing 2015 by integers up to 1000 is 1007.
