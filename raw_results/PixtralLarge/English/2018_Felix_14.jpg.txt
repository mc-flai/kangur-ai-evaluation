To determine the length of Susi's pattern made with ice-lolly sticks, we need to analyze the shape and configuration of the pattern.

1. **Identify the structure of the pattern**: The diagram shows a repeating pattern of squares, each formed by ice-lolly sticks. 
    - Each square is made up of 4 sticks.
    - The pattern has 3 squares lined up horizontally.

2. **Calculate the length contributed by horizontal sticks**: 
    - Each horizontal stick measures 5 cm.
    - There are 3 squares, each with 2 horizontal sticks contributing to the length. So, total horizontal sticks = 3 (squares) * 2 (sticks per square) = 6 horizontal sticks.
    - Total length from horizontal sticks = 6 sticks * 5 cm per stick = 30 cm.

3. **Calculate the length contributed by vertical sticks**: 
    - Each vertical stick also measures 5 cm, but they overlap and do not add to the horizontal length.

4. **Calculate the total length of the pattern**: 
    - Since only the horizontal sticks contribute to the overall length, the length of the pattern is 30 cm.

However, note that the question options do not exactly match our calculated length but are relatively close. Therefore, the most reasonable answer among the options would be the closest value to 30 cm.
   
Reasoning: The calculation of the horizontal length using the pattern structure and dimensions of each stick indicates the total length of the pattern is 30 cm, which is closest to option E (25 cm).

Answer: E).
