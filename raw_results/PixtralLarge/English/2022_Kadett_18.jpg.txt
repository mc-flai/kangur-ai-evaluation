**Reasoning**:
1. Werner wrote numbers whose sum is 22.
2. Ria subtracted each of Werner’s numbers from 7 and got a list of numbers whose sum is 34.
3. If Ria subtracted each of Werner’s numbers from 7, the sum of Werner's numbers is reduced by 7 for each number he wrote.
4. Let \( n \) be the number of numbers Werner wrote. Then, the total amount subtracted by Ria is \( 7n \).
5. Therefore, the sum of Ria's numbers can be written as \( 22 - 7n + 7n = 22 + 7n \).
6. We know the sum of Ria's numbers is 34, so \( 22 + 7n = 34 \).
7. Solving for \( n \):
   \[
   22 + 7n = 34 \\
   7n = 34 - 22 \\
   7n = 12 \\
   n = \frac{12}{7}
   \]
   This implies \( n \) is approximately 1.71, which does not make sense since the number of numbers must be a whole number.
8. On further inspection, the correct equation should be \( 22 - 7n + 7n = 22 + 7n \) is actually incorrect simplification.
9. The correct equation should be \( 7n - 22 = 34 \).
10. Solving for \( n \) again:
    \[
    7n - 22 = 34 \\
    7n = 34 + 22 \\
    7n = 56 \\
    n = \frac{56}{7} \\
    n = 8
    \]
