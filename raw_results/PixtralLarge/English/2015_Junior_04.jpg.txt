To determine how many more biscuits Anna should have gotten, we need to calculate the proportion of biscuits each person should receive based on the amount they paid.

1. **Calculate the total amount paid**:
   - Anna paid 80 cents.
   - Beate paid 50 cents.
   - Cindy paid 20 cents.
   - Total amount paid = 80 + 50 + 20 = 150 cents.

2. **Calculate the proportion of the total amount each person paid**:
   - Anna's proportion: 80 / 150 = 8 / 15
   - Beate's proportion: 50 / 150 = 5 / 15
   - Cindy's proportion: 20 / 150 = 2 / 15

3. **Calculate the number of biscuits each person should get based on their proportion**:
   - Total biscuits = 30
   - Anna's biscuits: (8 / 15) * 30 = 16
   - Beate's biscuits: (5 / 15) * 30 = 10
   - Cindy's biscuits: (2 / 15) * 30 = 4

4. **Determine how many more biscuits Anna should get**:
   - Anna originally got 10 biscuits.
   - Anna should get 16 biscuits.
   - Difference: 16 - 10 = 6

Reasoning: Anna should have gotten 6 more biscuits based on the amount she paid compared to the others.
