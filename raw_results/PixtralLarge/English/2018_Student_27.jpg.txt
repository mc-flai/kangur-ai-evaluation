**Reasoning**:
To solve the equation ||4x - 3| - 2| = 1, we need to consider the different cases for the absolute value expressions.

1. **Case 1**: 
   If |4x - 3| - 2 is non-negative, we can write:
   |4x - 3| - 2 = 1
   |4x - 3| = 3
   
   There are two subcases to consider for |4x - 3| = 3:
   - Subcase 1a:
     4x - 3 = 3
     4x = 6
     x = 1.5

   - Subcase 1b:
     4x - 3 = -3
     4x = 0
     x = 0

2. **Case 2**: 
   If |4x - 3| - 2 is negative, we can write:
   -(|4x - 3| - 2) = 1
   |4x - 3| - 2 = -1
   |4x - 3| = 1
   
   There are two subcases to consider for |4x - 3| = 1:
   - Subcase 2a:
     4x - 3 = 1
     4x = 4
     x = 1

   - Subcase 2b:
     4x - 3 = -1
     4x = 2
     x = 0.5

Summarizing the solutions from all the cases, we have x = 1.5, x = 0, x = 1, and x = 0.5. So there are 4 real solutions.
