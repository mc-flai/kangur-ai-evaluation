To determine the position of the circle when it has arrived at point L, we need to consider the distance \( KL \) and the circumference of the circle.

1. **Calculate the circumference of the circle**:
   The radius of the circle is 1 unit. The circumference \( C \) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   C = 2 \pi r
   \]
   Substituting \( r = 1 \):
   \[
   C = 2 \pi \times 1 = 2 \pi
   \]

2. **Determine how many full rotations the circle makes**:
   The distance \( KL \) is \( 11 \pi \). To find out how many complete revolutions the circle makes, we divide \( 11 \pi \) by the circumference \( 2 \pi \):
   \[
   \text{Number of rotations} = \frac{11 \pi}{2 \pi} = \frac{11}{2} = 5.5
   \]
   This means the circle makes 5 full rotations and half of another rotation.

3. **Identify the position after 5.5 rotations**:
   After 5 full rotations, the circle returns to its original position. The additional half rotation means the circle will be halfway through a full rotation.

4. **Visualize the position**:
   Half a rotation from the original position means the circle will be oriented such that the black segment will be at the bottom, and the gray and white segments will be rotated accordingly.

By examining the options (A) through (E), we can see that the correct position after 5.5 rotations is option (C), where the black segment is at the bottom.

Reasoning: The circle makes 5.5 rotations while traveling a distance of \( 11 \pi \), placing it in the position shown in option (C).

Answer: C)
