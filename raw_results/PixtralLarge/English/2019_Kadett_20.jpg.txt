To solve question 20, we need to determine the minimum number of matches Anna has used to create the path shown in the diagram. Each segment of the dotted line represents one matchstick. We need to count the total number of segments.

The path consists of the following segments:
- 2 horizontal segments at the top.
- 1 vertical segment downward.
- 3 horizontal segments at the bottom.
- 3 vertical segments upward (one on the left, one in the middle, and one on the right).

Adding these segments together:
2 (top horizontal) + 1 (downward vertical) + 3 (bottom horizontal) + 3 (upward vertical) = 9 segments.

However, since the path leads back to the left end of the first match, we need to count the segments that form the left side of the path. This includes:
- 2 vertical segments upward (one on the left and one on the right).
- 1 horizontal segment at the bottom.
- 3 vertical segments upward (one on the left, one in the middle, and one on the right).

Adding these segments together:
2 (left upward vertical) + 1 (bottom horizontal) + 3 (right upward vertical) = 6 segments.

The total number of segments required is 9 + 6 = 15 segments.

Since each segment represents one matchstick, the minimum number of matches used is 18.

Reasoning: The path consists of 9 segments for the initial path and 6 segments for the return path, totaling 15 segments. Since each segment represents one matchstick, the minimum number of matches used is 18.

Answer: D).
