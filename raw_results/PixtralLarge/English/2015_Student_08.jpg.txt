To determine how to cut the paper to completely cover the truncated cone-shaped drinking glass without an overlap, let's analyze the shape and the options provided.

1. **Understanding the Shape**:
   - A truncated cone is essentially a frustum of a cone, meaning it's a cone with the top cut off parallel to the base.
   - To cover the outside of this shape with paper, we need to consider how to flatten it into a 2D shape.

2. **Flattening the Truncated Cone**:
   - If we were to cut the truncated cone vertically from the top edge to the bottom edge and unfold it, it would form a trapezoidal shape.
   - The top and bottom edges of the trapezoid would correspond to the circumferences of the top and bottom circles of the truncated cone.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - Option (A) is a rectangle, which would not account for the tapering of the truncated cone.
   - Option (B) is a trapezoid, which is the correct shape needed to wrap around the truncated cone without overlap.
   - Option (C) is a sector of a circle, which does not match the shape needed.
   - Option (D) is a curved shape that does not represent the flattened form of a truncated cone.
   - Option (E) shows a partial sector, which also does not match the shape needed.

Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is:

Reasoning: The correct shape to cut the paper to completely cover the truncated cone-shaped drinking glass without an overlap is a trapezoid, which matches option (B).

Answer: B)
