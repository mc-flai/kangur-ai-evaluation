To determine which number is not divisible by its own digit sum, we need to calculate the digit sum for each of the given numbers and check if the number is divisible by that sum.

1. **2022**:
   - Digit sum = 2 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 6
   - Check divisibility: 2022 ÷ 6 = 337 (2022 is divisible by 6)

2. **2023**:
   - Digit sum = 2 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 7
   - Check divisibility: 2023 ÷ 7 = 289 (2023 is divisible by 7)

3. **2024**:
   - Digit sum = 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 8
   - Check divisibility: 2024 ÷ 8 = 253 (2024 is divisible by 8)

4. **2025**:
   - Digit sum = 2 + 0 + 2 + 5 = 9
   - Check divisibility: 2025 ÷ 9 = 225 (2025 is divisible by 9)

5. **2027**:
   - Digit sum = 2 + 0 + 2 + 7 = 11
   - Check divisibility: 2027 ÷ 11 = 184.2727... (2027 is not divisible by 11)

Since 2027 is not divisible by its digit sum (11), the correct answer is:

Reasoning: 2027 is not divisible by its digit sum of 11.
Answer: E).
