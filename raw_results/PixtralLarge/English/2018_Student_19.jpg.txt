To solve this problem, we need to determine the possible combinations of three cards for Nadia, calculate their product, and then check if the sum of these products with the product of the remaining two cards for Riny results in a prime number.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the card values:**
   - Cards shown: 3, 4, 7, 5, 6, 7, 2

2. **Determine the possible combinations for Nadia's three cards:**
   - We need to find combinations where the sum of Nadia's card values is given in the options. 
   - The combinations are:
     - 3, 4, 5 => Sum = 12
     - 3, 4, 6 => Sum = 13
     - 3, 5, 6 => Sum = 14 (Not an option)
     - 4, 5, 6 => Sum = 15
     - 3, 6, 7 => Sum = 16 (Not an option)
     - 4, 5, 7 => Sum = 16 (Not an option)
     - 3, 5, 7 => Sum = 15 (Duplicate)
     - 3, 6, 2 => Sum = 11 (Not an option)
     - 4, 6, 2 => Sum = 12 (Duplicate)
     - 5, 6, 2 => Sum = 13 (Duplicate)
     - 6, 7, 2 => Sum = 15 (Duplicate)
     - 4, 7, 2 => Sum = 13 (Duplicate)
     - 5, 7, 2 => Sum = 14 (Not an option)
     - 3, 4, 7 => Sum = 14 (Not an option)
     - 3, 7, 2 => Sum = 12 (Duplicate)
     - 4, 5, 2 => Sum = 11 (Not an option)

3. **Calculate the products for valid combinations:**
   - For 3, 4, 5 (Sum = 12): 
     - Nadia's product: 3 * 4 * 5 = 60
     - Riny's cards: 7, 6
     - Riny's product: 7 * 6 = 42
     - Sum of products: 60 + 42 = 102 (Not prime)

   - For 3, 4, 6 (Sum = 13): 
     - Nadia's product: 3 * 4 * 6 = 72
     - Riny's cards: 7, 5
     - Riny's product: 7 * 5 = 35
     - Sum of products: 72 + 35 = 107 (Prime)

   - For 4, 5, 6 (Sum = 15): 
     - Nadia's product: 4 * 5 * 6 = 120
     - Riny's cards: 7, 3
     - Riny's product: 7 * 3 = 21
     - Sum of products: 120 + 21 = 141 (Not prime)

   - For 3, 6, 7 (Sum = 16) (Not an option)
   - For 4, 5, 7 (Sum = 16) (Not an option)
   - For 3, 5, 7 (Sum = 15): 
     - Nadia's product: 3 * 5 * 7 = 105
     - Riny's cards: 6, 4
     - Riny's product: 6 * 4 = 24
     - Sum of products: 105 + 24 = 129 (Not prime)

   - For 3, 6, 2 (Sum = 11) (Not an option)
   - For 4, 6, 2 (Sum = 12): 
     - Nadia's product: 4 * 6 * 2 = 48
     - Riny's cards: 7, 5
     - Riny's product: 7 * 5 = 35
     - Sum of products: 48 + 35 = 83 (Prime)

   - For 5, 6, 2 (Sum = 13): 
     - Nadia's product: 5 * 6 * 2 = 60
     - Riny's cards: 7, 4
     - Riny's product: 7 * 4 = 28
     - Sum of products: 60 + 28 = 88 (Not prime)

   - For 6, 7, 2 (Sum = 15): 
     - Nadia's product: 6 * 7 * 2 = 84
     - Riny's cards: 5, 4
     - Riny's product: 5 * 4 = 20
     - Sum of products: 84 + 20 = 104 (Not prime)

   - For 4, 7, 2 (Sum = 13): 
     - Nadia's product: 4 * 7 * 2 = 56
     - Riny's cards: 6, 5
     - Riny's product: 6 * 5 = 30
     - Sum of products: 56 + 30 = 86 (Not prime)

   - For 5, 7, 2 (Sum = 14) (Not an option)
   - For 3, 4, 7 (Sum = 14) (Not an option)
   - For 3, 7, 2 (Sum = 12):
     - Nadia's product: 3 * 7 * 2 = 42
     - Riny's cards: 6, 5
     - Riny's product: 6 * 5 = 30
     - Sum of products: 42 + 30 = 72 (Not prime)
   - For 4, 5, 2 (Sum = 11) (Not an option)

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The valid sums that result in a prime number are 13 and 12.
   - The correct answer is the sum of the values of Nadiaâ€™s cards that results in a prime number when the products are summed.

Reasoning: The sum of the values of Nadia's cards that results in a prime number when the products are summed is 13.
Answer: B).
