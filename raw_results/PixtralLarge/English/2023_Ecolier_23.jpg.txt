To determine the number that should be written in the circle with the question mark, we need to follow the rule given: when two numbers are next to each other, their sum will equal the number in the circle between them.

Let's analyze the circles around the question mark:

1. The circle with the question mark is flanked by a circle with the number 9 and another with the number 6.
2. According to the rule, the sum of 9 and 6 should equal the number in the circle with the question mark.

So, we perform the calculation:

9 + 6 = 15

Therefore, the number that should be written in the circle with the question mark is 15.

Comparing this result with the given options:
- (A) 1
- (B) 2
- (C) 3
- (D) 4
- (E) 5

None of the given options match our calculated answer of 15, which suggests there might be a mistake either in the problem statement or in the answer choices provided.

However, the closest logical answer based on the given problem statement is not listed. We can assume the problem might be intended to check for understanding rather than providing a direct match.

Reasoning: The sum of 9 and 6 is 15. There is no matching option provided in the choices.
Answer: Not applicable.
