To determine what Paul sees when he looks at the interlinked rings from the back, we need to understand how the rings appear from different perspectives. Peter sees the rings from the front, where the white ring is in front of the grey ring. This means when viewed from the back, the positions of the rings will be reversed.

When observing from the back, the grey ring would be in front and the white ring would be behind it. By examining the provided options, we need to find the diagram that shows the grey ring in front and the white ring behind it.

Option (A) shows the white ring in front.
Option (B) shows the grey ring in front but with an incorrect interlinking.
Option (C) shows the grey ring in front but with an incorrect interlinking.
Option (D) shows the grey ring in front with the correct interlinking.
Option (E) shows the grey ring in front but with an incorrect interlinking.

Thus, the correct depiction where the grey ring is in front and the white ring is behind it, with correct interlinking, is option (D).

Reasoning: The correct view from the back would have the grey ring in front and the white ring behind it, with the correct interlinking as shown in option (D).
Answer: D).
