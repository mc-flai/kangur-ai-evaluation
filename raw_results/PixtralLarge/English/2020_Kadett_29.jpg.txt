To solve this problem, we need to determine the product of the three consecutive whole numbers written on the sides of the triangle. Let's denote these three consecutive whole numbers as \(a\), \(a+1\), and \(a+2\).

1. **Sum of numbers at each vertex**:
   - At each vertex, the sum of the numbers on the sides that touch this vertex is the same.
   - The numbers on the sides of the triangle are \(a\), \(a+1\), and \(a+2\).

2. **Sum at each vertex**:
   - For the vertex where \(a\) and \(a+1\) meet, the sum is \(a + (a+1) = 2a + 1\).
   - For the vertex where \(a+1\) and \(a+2\) meet, the sum is \((a+1) + (a+2) = 2a + 3\).
   - For the vertex where \(a+2\) and \(a\) meet, the sum is \((a+2) + a = 2a + 2\).

3. **Product of sums at vertices**:
   - The product of these sums is given as 504.
   - Therefore, \((2a + 1)(2a + 3)(2a + 2) = 504\).

4. **Simplifying the equation**:
   - We notice that \((2a + 1)\), \((2a + 2)\), and \((2a + 3)\) are three consecutive numbers.
   - The product of three consecutive numbers that equals 504 can be found by trial and error or by factoring.

5. **Factoring 504**:
   - \(504 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 7\).
   - The consecutive numbers that multiply to 504 are 6, 7, and 8 because \(6 \times 7 \times 8 = 336\).

6. **Checking for the correct product**:
   - Therefore, the product of the three numbers written on the sides of the triangle is 336.

Reasoning: The product of the three consecutive whole numbers written on the sides of the triangle is 336.

Answer: E) 336.
