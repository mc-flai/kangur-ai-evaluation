To determine the label on the hidden cannon ball in the middle of the fourth face of the triangular pyramid, we need to analyze the given three visible faces and the pattern of labels.

From the visible faces, we can see the following arrangements:

- The first face has the labels:
  ```
    D
   C A
  B E D
 D E C A
```

- The second face has the labels:
  ```
    D
   B C
  E A B
 D A D A
```

- The third face has the labels:
  ```
    D
   A B
  D C E
 A E B C
```

The key observation is that the center ball on each face is labeled 'A'. Since the triangular pyramid is symmetric, the hidden cannon ball in the middle of the fourth face should also follow this pattern.

Therefore, the label on the hidden cannon ball in the middle of the fourth face is 'A'.

Reasoning: The center ball on each visible face is labeled 'A'. By symmetry, the hidden center ball on the fourth face should also be labeled 'A'.
