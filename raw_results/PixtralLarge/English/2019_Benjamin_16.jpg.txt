To determine which net of a cube forms a closed loop when folded into a cube, let's analyze each of the given options.

1. **Option A**: The line drawn does not form a closed loop. It starts and ends in different places on the net.
2. **Option B**: The line forms a closed loop, starting and ending at the same point on the net, making a complete circuit around one of the faces of the cube.
3. **Option C**: The line does not form a closed loop. It starts and ends in different places on the net.
4. **Option D**: The line forms a closed loop, starting and ending at the same point on the net, making a complete circuit around one of the faces of the cube.
5. **Option E**: The line does not form a closed loop. It starts and ends in different places on the net.

Based on this analysis, the nets in options B and D both form closed loops when folded into a cube. 

**Reasoning**: The net must have a line that starts and ends at the same point on the net to form a closed loop when folded into a cube.
**Answer**: B) or D).
