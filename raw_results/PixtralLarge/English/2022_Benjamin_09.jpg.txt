**Reasoning**: The square ABCD has sides that are each 10 cm long. The shaded part consists of four identical right-angled triangles, each of which has legs that are half the length of the sides of the square. Since the legs of each triangle are half of 10 cm, they are 5 cm each.

The area of one right-angled triangle is calculated as:

\[ \text{Area of one triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{leg}_1 \times \text{leg}_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 5 = 12.5 \text{ cm}^2 \]

Since there are four such triangles, the total area of the shaded part is:

\[ \text{Total shaded area} = 4 \times 12.5 \text{ cm}^2 = 50 \text{ cm}^2 \]

**Answer**: C).
