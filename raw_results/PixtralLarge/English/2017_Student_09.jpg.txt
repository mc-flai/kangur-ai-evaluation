To determine which box gives Benedict the highest probability of drawing a blue ball without looking, we need to calculate the probability of drawing a blue ball for each box. The probability is calculated by dividing the number of blue balls by the total number of balls in each box.

- Box (A): 10 blues, 8 reds. Total balls = 18. Probability = 10/18 = 5/9.
- Box (B): 6 blues, 4 reds. Total balls = 10. Probability = 6/10 = 3/5.
- Box (C): 8 blues, 6 reds. Total balls = 14. Probability = 8/14 = 4/7.
- Box (D): 7 blues, 7 reds. Total balls = 14. Probability = 7/14 = 1/2.
- Box (E): 12 blues, 9 reds. Total balls = 21. Probability = 12/21 = 4/7.

Now compare the probabilities:
- 5/9 (Box A)
- 3/5 (Box B)
- 4/7 (Box C)
- 1/2 (Box D)
- 4/7 (Box E)

The highest probability is 3/5 which is found in box (B).

Reasoning: The highest probability of drawing a blue ball without looking is found in box (B), where the probability is 3/5.
Answer: B).
