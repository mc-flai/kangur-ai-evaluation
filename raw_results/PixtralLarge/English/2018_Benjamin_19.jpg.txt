**Reasoning**:
1. **Initial Position**:
   - One ladybird is asleep in the bottom-left cell.
   - The other three ladybirds are in the top-left, top-right, and bottom-right cells.

2. **After the First Whistle**:
   - The three active ladybirds move to adjacent cells.
   - Top-left ladybird moves down to the center-left cell.
   - Top-right ladybird moves left to the center-top cell.
   - Bottom-right ladybird moves left to the center-bottom cell.

3. **After the Second Whistle**:
   - Top-left ladybird (now center-left) moves right to the center-center cell.
   - Top-right ladybird (now center-top) moves down to the center-center cell.
   - Bottom-right ladybird (now center-bottom) moves up to the center-center cell.

4. **After the Third Whistle**:
   - The three ladybirds in the center-center cell move to different adjacent cells:
     - One moves left to the center-left cell.
     - One moves up to the top-center cell.
     - One moves right to the center-right cell.

5. **After the Fourth Whistle**:
   - The three ladybirds move to another set of different adjacent cells:
     - Center-left ladybird moves up to the top-left cell.
     - Top-center ladybird moves right to the top-right cell.
     - Center-right ladybird moves down to the bottom-right cell.

So, the correct answer is the option that matches this configuration.

**Answer**: C).
