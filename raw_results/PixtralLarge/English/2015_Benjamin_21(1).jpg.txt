To determine which square(s) Nina can remove from the net to still form a cube, we need to consider the structure of the cube and how the squares are connected. A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. The net shown has 7 squares, which means one square must be removed to form a net that can be folded into a cube.

Let's analyze the net:

```
1 2 3
  4
5 6 7
```

- Square 1 is connected to squares 2 and 5.
- Square 2 is connected to squares 1, 3, and 6.
- Square 3 is connected to squares 2 and 7.
- Square 4 is connected to squares 5 and 6.
- Square 5 is connected to squares 1, 4, and 6.
- Square 6 is connected to squares 2, 4, 5, and 7.
- Square 7 is connected to squares 3 and 6.

To form a cube, we need to ensure that the remaining 6 squares can be folded into a cube. This means that each face must be connected properly to form the 3D shape.

- Removing square 4: If we remove square 4, the remaining squares (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7) can be folded into a cube.
- Removing square 7: If we remove square 7, the remaining squares (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) can also be folded into a cube.

Thus, either square 4 or square 7 can be removed to form a cube.

Reasoning: By analyzing the connections of each square in the net, we can determine that removing either square 4 or square 7 will allow the remaining squares to be folded into a cube.
