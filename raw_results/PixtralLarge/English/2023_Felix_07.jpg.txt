To determine what the piece of paper looks like when Susi unfolds it again, we need to visualize how the holes align when the paper is folded and unfolded.

**Reasoning:**
1. Susi folds the paper in the middle, creating a vertical fold line.
2. She stamps two holes, one on each side of the fold.
3. When the paper is folded, the hole on one side will align perfectly with the hole on the other side because they are on opposite sides of the fold line.
4. When she unfolds the paper, each hole will appear on both sides of the fold line.

Therefore, the paper will have two holes, each appearing on both sides of the fold line, resulting in four holes in total.

**Answer:** B).
