**Reasoning**: To determine the percentage of water in the soft cheese, we need to consider both the amount of fat and the amount of dry substance. The packaging tells us that the total amount of fat is 24%, and the fat in the dry substance is 64%. This means that 36% of the dry substance is not fat (100% - 64% = 36%).

To find the percentage of dry substance in the cheese, we can use the given fat percentage:
- Let the dry substance be \( d \) and the total weight of cheese be 100g.
- The fat in the cheese is 24g (24% of 100g).
- The fat in the dry substance is 64%, which means 0.64 * \( d \) = 24g.

Solving for \( d \):
\[ 0.64d = 24 \]
\[ d = \frac{24}{0.64} \]
\[ d = 37.5 \]

So, the dry substance is 37.5g, which is 37.5% of the total weight. The remaining percentage is water. Therefore, the water percentage is:
\[ 100\% - 37.5\% = 62.5\% \]
