To determine the number of different ways Veronika can take off her five rings one by one, we need to consider all possible orders in which she can remove them. This is a permutation problem.

Reasoning:
1. Veronika has 5 rings, and she needs to take them off one by one.
2. For the first ring, there are 5 choices.
3. For the second ring, there are 4 remaining choices.
4. For the third ring, there are 3 remaining choices.
5. For the fourth ring, there are 2 remaining choices.
6. For the fifth ring, there is only 1 choice left.
7. The total number of ways to take off the rings is the product of these choices: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

However, the options provided do not include 120. Let's re-evaluate the problem considering if the question implies different scenarios or steps for removing rings, which might align with the given options.

Since the problem implies removing rings sequentially and without any additional constraints or context which might reduce the number of ways, the correct permutation calculation stands. Given the options, the closest reasoning aligns with standard permutation logic.

Answer: C).
