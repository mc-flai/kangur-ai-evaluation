**Reasoning**: The problem states that the container ship MSC Fabiola carries 12,500 identical long containers. When these containers are put next to each other in a row, they make a 75 km long container line. To find the length of one container, we need to divide the total length of the container line by the number of containers.

First, convert 75 km to meters:
75 km = 75,000 meters

Now, divide the total length in meters by the number of containers:
75,000 meters / 12,500 containers = 6 meters

Therefore, one container is 6 meters long.

**Answer**: A) 6 m
