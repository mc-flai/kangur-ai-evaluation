To determine the minimum number of light bulbs to touch in order to switch on all the light bulbs, we need to analyze the given graph.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The circles represent light bulbs.
   - All light bulbs are initially switched off.
   - Touching one light bulb switches it on and also switches on all directly adjacent light bulbs.

2. **Graph Analysis:**
   - The graph is a simple undirected graph where nodes represent light bulbs and edges represent adjacency.
   - We need to find the minimum number of light bulbs to touch such that all light bulbs in the graph get switched on.

3. **Strategy:**
   - Identify the light bulbs that have the most connections (highest degree) as they will maximize the number of adjacent bulbs switched on.
   - Starting with the highest degree nodes, determine if all bulbs can be switched on.

4. **Observation:**
   - The light bulb in the very center (highest degree in the graph) is connected to four other light bulbs.
   - If we touch this central light bulb, it will switch on itself and the four connected light bulbs.
   - This leaves us with four light bulbs that are not yet switched on.
   - We need to touch at least one more light bulb to ensure all remaining light bulbs are switched on.

5. **Verification:**
   - Touching the central light bulb switches on itself and four others.
   - Touching any one of the remaining four unswitched light bulbs will switch on itself and any adjacent light bulbs.
   - This sequence ensures all light bulbs are switched on after touching two light bulbs.

**Reasoning:**
By touching the central light bulb and one additional light bulb from the remaining unswitched ones, all light bulbs in the graph will be switched on.

**Answer:** C)
