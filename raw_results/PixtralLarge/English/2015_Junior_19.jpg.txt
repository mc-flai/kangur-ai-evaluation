**Reasoning**:
We need to find the number of three-digit positive whole numbers where the difference between adjacent digits is always 3.

1. Identify possible digit pairs where the digits differ by 3:
   - (0, 3)
   - (1, 4)
   - (2, 5)
   - (3, 6)
   - (4, 7)
   - (5, 8)
   - (6, 9)

2. Form three-digit numbers using valid pairs:
   - For (0, 3): 030, 033
   - For (1, 4): 141, 144
   - For (2, 5): 252, 255
   - For (3, 6): 363, 366
   - For (4, 7): 474, 477
   - For (5, 8): 585, 588
   - For (6, 9): 696, 699

3. Count the valid three-digit numbers that can be formed:
   - There are 2 numbers for each pair.
   - There are 7 pairs.
   - Total numbers = 2 * 7 = 14.

However, the above list includes numbers that are not three-digit numbers (e.g., 030 is not a valid three-digit number). We need to exclude invalid numbers:
   - 030 is invalid.
   - 033 is invalid.

Valid three-digit numbers:
   - 141, 144, 252, 255, 363, 366, 474, 477, 585, 588, 696, 699

Total valid three-digit numbers = 12.

**Answer**: A) 12.
