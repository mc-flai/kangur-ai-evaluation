To analyze question 7, we need to determine the shape of the part of the rectangle that is hidden by the curtain.

**Reasoning**:
- The image shows a rectangle partially hidden by a curtain.
- The visible part of the rectangle suggests that part of it is obscured.

- The hidden part must be a continuation of the rectangle, maintaining the same shape.
- Since the visible part is a rectangle, the hidden part must also be a rectangle to maintain the geometrical consistency of the shape.
