**Reasoning**: 

1. Determine how many eggs 5 ducks lay every day:
   - 5 ducks lay 5 eggs every day.

2. Calculate how many eggs 5 ducks lay in 10 days:
   - 5 eggs/day * 10 days = 50 eggs.

3. Determine how many eggs the other 5 ducks lay every second day:
   - The other 5 ducks lay 5 eggs every second day.

4. Calculate how many eggs the other 5 ducks lay in 10 days:
   - They will lay eggs on 5 out of the 10 days (since they lay eggs every second day).
   - 5 eggs/day * 5 days = 25 eggs.

5. Add the eggs laid by both groups of ducks:
   - 50 eggs (first group) + 25 eggs (second group) = 75 eggs.

**Answer**: A)
