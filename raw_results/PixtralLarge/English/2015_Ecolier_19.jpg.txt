**Reasoning**:
The problem requires that the sum of the three numbers in the horizontal row be equal to the sum of the three numbers in the vertical column. The given numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9. 

Let's denote the middle number as x.

The horizontal sum is: 1 + x + 9
The vertical sum is: 2 + x + 4

We set these two sums equal to each other:
1 + x + 9 = 2 + x + 4

Solving for x:
10 + x = 6 + x

Subtract x from both sides:
10 = 6

This is a contradiction, indicating an error in the problem setup. However, checking the given numbers, we realize the task is to find x such that the sums match.

We need to check each provided option to see if it satisfies the requirement:

- If x = 1:
  1 + 1 + 9 = 11
  2 + 1 + 4 = 7
  (Not matching)

- If x = 2:
  1 + 2 + 9 = 12
  2 + 2 + 4 = 8
  (Not matching)

- If x = 3:
  1 + 3 + 9 = 13
  2 + 3 + 4 = 9
  (Not matching)

- If x = 4:
  1 + 4 + 9 = 14
  2 + 4 + 4 = 10
  (Not matching)

- If x = 9:
  1 + 9 + 9 = 19
  2 + 9 + 4 = 15
  (Not matching)

None of the provided options directly satisfy the equal sum condition. However, we notice that if the sums are equal, it is likely due to the actual figure provided having a unique solution. Given the closest logical reasoning for a potential solution, x = 3 makes the most sense for middle placement to balance the sums as close as possible.
