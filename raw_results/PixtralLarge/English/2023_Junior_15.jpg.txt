The problem involves comparing the perimeter of pentagon \(ABCDE\) with the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\). The key points to consider are:

1. Triangle \(ABC\) is equilateral, which means all sides are equal.
2. Triangles \(AEF\), \(DFE\), and \(CDF\) are congruent isosceles triangles.

Let's denote the side length of the equilateral triangle \(ABC\) as \(s\).

Since \(AEF\), \(DFE\), and \(CDF\) are congruent isosceles triangles, each triangle has two equal sides.

### Reasoning:
1. The perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is \(3s\).
2. The isosceles triangles \(AEF\), \(DFE\), and \(CDF\) each have two equal sides, which can be denoted as \(x\).
3. Since these triangles are congruent, they share the same side lengths.
4. Therefore, the perimeter of pentagon \(ABCDE\) can be calculated by noting that it is split into four triangles that all share sides with each other.
5. The sides contributing to the perimeter of pentagon \(ABCDE\) are \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), \(DE\), and \(EA\).

Given that \(AB = BC = s\) and the other sides are part of the congruent isosceles triangles, we can infer:
- \(CD = DE = EA = x\).

Thus, the perimeter of pentagon \(ABCDE\) is \(2s + 3x\).

The ratio of the perimeter of pentagon \(ABCDE\) to the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[ \frac{2s + 3x}{3s} \]

Given that the triangles are congruent and isosceles, the side \(x\) is equal to the side \(s\), as they share the same dimensions within the pentagon.

Thus, the ratio simplifies to:
\[ \frac{2s + 3s}{3s} = \frac{5s}{3s} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: E)
