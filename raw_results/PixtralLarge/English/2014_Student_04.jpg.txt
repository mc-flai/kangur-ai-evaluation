To determine the number of balls in the biggest basket, let's denote the number of balls in the middle basket as M.

1. According to the problem, the smallest and the biggest basket together hold twice as many balls as the middle one. This can be written as:
   \[
   S + B = 2M
   \]
   where S is the number of balls in the smallest basket and B is the number of balls in the biggest basket.

2. It is also given that the smallest basket holds half as many balls as the middle one:
   \[
   S = \frac{1}{2}M
   \]

3. We know the total number of balls in all three baskets is 48:
   \[
   S + M + B = 48
   \]

4. Substitute \( S = \frac{1}{2}M \) into the total equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}M + M + B = 48
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2}M + B = 48
   \]

5. From the first equation \( S + B = 2M \), substitute \( S = \frac{1}{2}M \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}M + B = 2M
   \]
   Simplify to find B:
   \[
   B = 2M - \frac{1}{2}M = \frac{3}{2}M
   \]

6. Now substitute \( B = \frac{3}{2}M \) into the total equation:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2}M + \frac{3}{2}M = 48
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   3M = 48
   \]
   Solve for M:
   \[
   M = 16
   \]

7. Now calculate B using \( B = \frac{3}{2}M \):
   \[
   B = \frac{3}{2} \times 16 = 24
   \]

Reasoning: Using the relationships between the number of balls in the baskets and the constraints provided, we determined that the biggest basket holds 24 balls.
