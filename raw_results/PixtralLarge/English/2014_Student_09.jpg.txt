To determine the volume of the resulting cylinder compared to the volume of one of the small cylinders, we need to analyze the relationship between the dimensions of the cylinders.

1. When two identical cylinders are cut open along the vertical dotted line and combined, they form a new cylinder.
2. The radius of the new cylinder will be the same as the original cylinders.
3. The height of the new cylinder will be twice the height of one of the small cylinders because they are combined vertically.

The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

For the small cylinder:
\[ V_{\text{small}} = \pi r^2 h \]

For the resulting cylinder:
\[ V_{\text{resulting}} = \pi r^2 (2h) = 2 \pi r^2 h \]

This shows that the volume of the resulting cylinder is twice the volume of one of the small cylinders.

Reasoning: The volume of the resulting cylinder is twice that of one small cylinder because the height is doubled while the radius remains the same.
