To determine the correct order in which Else uses machines R and S to produce the final picture, we need to analyze the transformations each machine performs:

1. **Machine R**: This machine rotates a square piece of paper.
2. **Machine S**: This machine prints a club symbol (â™£) on the square piece of paper.

The desired final picture is a square with a club symbol printed on it. Let's determine the correct sequence:

- **Step 1**: To get a club symbol on the paper, it must pass through machine S.
- **Step 2**: Since the final picture is a square with the club symbol printed on it, the paper must already be a square before passing through machine S.
- **Step 3**: Machine R rotates the square paper, so the sequence should ensure the square is already rotated before or after it is printed on.

Considering these steps, the correct sequence must ensure that the paper is rotated by machine R before being printed on by machine S. Thus, the correct order is:

- First, the paper is rotated by machine R.
- Then, the rotated paper is printed on by machine S.

Reasoning: To produce a square with a club symbol, the paper must be rotated by machine R and then printed on by machine S.
Answer: RS.

So, the correct option is D) RRS.
