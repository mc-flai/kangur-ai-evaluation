To solve question 28, we need to determine how many ways we can fill a 2x3 table with the numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} such that the sum of the numbers in each column and each row is divisible by 3.

Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the set and the table**: The set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and the table is a 2x3 table.
2. **Sum of each row and column must be divisible by 3**: We need to ensure that the numbers placed in the table satisfy this condition.

To find the number of ways to arrange these numbers, consider the properties of the numbers in the set:
- The numbers 1, 2, and 5 are not divisible by 3.
- The numbers 3 and 6 are divisible by 3.
- The number 4 gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.

To make the sum of each row and column divisible by 3:
- Each row and column must have a combination of numbers that add up to a sum divisible by 3.
- This requires strategic placement of the numbers that are divisible by 3 (3 and 6) and those that are not.

Given the constraints and the need to balance the sums, we can calculate the number of valid arrangements. This is a combinatorial problem that involves counting the number of ways to place the numbers while satisfying the divisibility condition.

After careful consideration and combinatorial analysis, the correct number of ways to achieve this is found to be:

Reasoning: The problem involves combinatorial arrangements of numbers in a 2x3 table such that the sum of each row and column is divisible by 3. By analyzing the properties of the numbers in the set and the constraints, we can determine the number of valid arrangements.
