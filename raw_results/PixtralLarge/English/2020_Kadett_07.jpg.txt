To determine the smallest result Carlos can get by squaring the sum of three chosen numbers from the list \(-5, -3, -1, 0, 2, 7\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the smallest possible sum of three numbers**:
   - We should choose the three smallest numbers from the list to minimize the sum.
   - The smallest numbers in the list are \(-5, -3,\) and \(-1\).

2. **Calculate the sum of these three smallest numbers**:
   \[
   -5 + (-3) + (-1) = -5 - 3 - 1 = -9
   \]

3. **Square the sum obtained in the previous step**:
   \[
   (-9)^2 = 81
   \]

4. **Compare the squared result with the given options**:
   - The options are \(0, 1, 4, 9, 16\).
   - The squared result \(81\) is not among the given options.

Since none of the given options match the calculated smallest result, we need to reevaluate our approach. Let's check if there is another possible smallest sum that might yield one of the given options:

- Next smallest sums:
  - Choosing \(-5, -3, 0\):
    \[
    -5 + (-3) + 0 = -5 - 3 + 0 = -8
    \]
    \[
    (-8)^2 = 64
    \]
  - Choosing \(-5, -3, 2\):
    \[
    -5 + (-3) + 2 = -5 - 3 + 2 = -6
    \]
    \[
    (-6)^2 = 36
    \]
  - Choosing \(-5, -1, 0\):
    \[
    -5 + (-1) + 0 = -5 - 1 + 0 = -6
    \]
    \[
    (-6)^2 = 36
    \]
  - Choosing \(-5, -1, 2\):
    \[
    -5 + (-1) + 2 = -5 - 1 + 2 = -4
    \]
    \[
    (-4)^2 = 16
    \]

The only squared result that matches one of the given options is \(16\), which is obtained by choosing the numbers \(-5, -1, 2\).

**Reasoning**: The smallest result Carlos can get by squaring the sum of three chosen numbers from the list is \(16\), which is obtained by choosing the numbers \(-5, -1, 2\).

**Answer**: E).
