**Reasoning**:
1. Paulo starts with a rectangular sheet of paper and follows a sequence of folds to create a paper airplane.
2. Each fold in the sequence creates a line that intersects the paper at multiple points.
3. Given the nature of the folds and the diagrams provided, each fold likely halves the paper or brings parts of the paper together, creating intersection points.
4. When Paulo made a circular hole in the final figure, it would have intersected each folded section of the paper.
5. Considering the sequence of folds and the intersection points, we can deduce the number of holes by counting the sections created by the folds.
6. The total number of sections created by the folds is equal to the number of holes.
7. By examining each step:
   - The first fold creates two sections (1 hole).
   - The second fold splits this into four sections (2 holes).
   - The third fold splits this into eight sections (4 holes).
   - The fourth fold further splits this into sixteen sections (8 holes).
8. Since the circular hole intersects each section, the total number of holes is 16.

**Answer**: E).
