**Reasoning**: 

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We have two identical cylindrical glasses, both with a base area of \(3\pi \, \text{cm}^2\).
   - The left glass is upright, while the right one is leaning at an angle such that the water level in both glasses is the same height, with the leaning glass touching its bottom at exactly one point.
   - The volume of water in both glasses is the same because the amount of water is the same.

2. **Volume Calculation**:
   - For the upright glass, the volume is the base area multiplied by the height of the water.
   - For the leaning glass, the water forms a triangular prism shape with the same base area and height.

3. **Volume Formula**:
   - Volume \(V\) of the upright glass is given by:
     \[
     V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 3\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \times h
     \]
     Since the base area is \(3\pi \, \text{cm}^2\), we can denote the height as \(h\).

4. **Volume of the Leaning Glass**:
   - The leaning glass forms a triangular prism with a base area of \(3\pi \, \text{cm}^2\) and the same height \(h\).
   - Using trigonometry and geometry, we can determine that the volume is the same in both glasses.

5. **Determining the Volume**:
   - Given the height \(h\) where the water touches exactly one point at the bottom of the leaning glass, the volume in the leaning glass can be represented as:
     \[
     V = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base area} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \times h
     \]
   - Since the volume of water is the same in both glasses, we equate the volumes:
     \[
     3\pi h = \frac{3\pi h}{2}
     \]
   - Solving for \(h\), we find that \(h\) must be such that the volume is a multiple of \(\frac{3\pi}{2}\).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the base area and the identical volumes, the correct volume must be \(3\sqrt{3}\pi \, \text{cm}^3\), which matches option C).

**Answer**: C).
