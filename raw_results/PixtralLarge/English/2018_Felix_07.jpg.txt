To determine the correct path the dog takes, we need to count the number of right and left turns in each option and compare them to the requirements (3 right turns and 2 left turns).

1. **Option A**:
   - Right turns: 1
   - Left turns: 2
   - This path does not meet the criteria since it has only 1 right turn.

2. **Option B**:
   - Right turns: 2
   - Left turns: 1
   - This path does not meet the criteria since it has only 2 right turns and 1 left turn.

3. **Option C**:
   - Right turns: 2
   - Left turns: 2
   - This path does not meet the criteria since it has only 2 right turns.

4. **Option D**:
   - Right turns: 3
   - Left turns: 2
   - This path meets the criteria with 3 right turns and 2 left turns.

5. **Option E**:
   - Right turns: 2
   - Left turns: 1
   - This path does not meet the criteria since it has only 2 right turns and 1 left turn.

By comparing the number of turns in each option to the given requirements, we can conclude that only Option D meets the criteria.

Reasoning: Option D is the only path with exactly 3 right turns and 2 left turns, matching the requirements.

Answer: D
