**Reasoning**: Maria has 9 white, 9 light gray, and 9 dark gray cubes, making a total of 27 cubes. These 27 cubes can be arranged into a larger 3x3x3 cube. Each face of the larger cube should have an equal number of cubes of each color if they are evenly distributed. By examining the options, we need to identify which cube has an even distribution of white, light gray, and dark gray cubes on its visible faces.

- Option (A): Shows a mix of white, light gray, and dark gray cubes on all visible faces.
- Option (B): Shows only light gray cubes on all visible faces.
- Option (C): Shows a mix of white and light gray cubes on all visible faces.
- Option (D): Shows a mix of white, light gray, and dark gray cubes but not evenly distributed.
- Option (E): Shows a mix of white and light gray cubes on all visible faces.

The only option that shows an even distribution of all three colors on all visible faces is option (A).

**Answer**: A).
