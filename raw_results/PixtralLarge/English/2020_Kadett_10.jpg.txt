**Reasoning**:
- The given figure consists of a square and an equilateral triangle.
- The angles in a square are all 90 degrees, and the angles in an equilateral triangle are all 60 degrees.
- The sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees.
- Let's use these properties to analyze the given options.

1. **Option (A) \(a = d\)**:
   - \(a\) and \(d\) are not directly related, as they are angles from different triangles. This cannot be true without more specific geometric relationships.

2. **Option (B) \(b + c = d\)**:
   - \(b\) and \(c\) are parts of the angles in the triangles, and \(d\) is an angle in the square. This relationship does not hold based on the geometric properties given.

3. **Option (C) \(a + c = d + e\)**:
   - \(a\) and \(c\) are angles in the triangles, while \(d\) and \(e\) are angles in the square and triangle. This relationship does not hold based on the geometric properties given.

4. **Option (D) \(a + b = d + e\)**:
   - \(a\) and \(b\) are angles in the triangles, while \(d\) and \(e\) are angles in the square and triangle. This relationship does not hold based on the geometric properties given.

5. **Option (E) \(e + d = a\)**:
   - \(e\) and \(d\) are angles in the square and triangle, while \(a\) is an angle in the triangle. This relationship does not hold based on the geometric properties given.

Given the geometric properties and the sum of angles around a point, we need to re-evaluate the relationships. The correct relationship involves the sum of angles around the point where the square and triangle meet. The correct equality should consider the internal angles and their sums.

Upon closer inspection, the correct relationship is:
- \(a + b + c = 180^\circ\) (sum of angles in a triangle)
- \(d + e = 90^\circ + 60^\circ = 150^\circ\)
- Therefore, \(a + b + c = d + e + 30^\circ\)

This matches option (D) when considering the geometric properties and the sum of angles around a point.

**Answer**: D).
