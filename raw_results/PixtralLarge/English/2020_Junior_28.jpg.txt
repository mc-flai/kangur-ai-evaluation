To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance from point D to the E end of the new straight AE fence.

1. **Identify the given lengths:**
   - AB = 30 meters
   - BC = 24 meters
   - CD = 10 meters

2. **Calculate the total length of AD:**
   - AD = AB + BC + CD
   - AD = 30 m + 24 m + 10 m
   - AD = 64 meters

3. **Determine the distance AE:**
   - For the area of both lands to remain unchanged, the AE fence must be straight and parallel to the original diagonal fence.
   - The original diagonal fence separates the area into two rectangles.
   - The new fence AE must follow the same diagonal direction but with a new straight alignment.
   - The length of AE should be such that the area of the two lands is preserved.

4. **Analyze the options:**
   - A) 8 m
   - B) 10 m
   - C) 12 m
   - D) 14 m
   - E) 16 m

5. **Use geometric properties to find AE:**
   - Since the new fence AE is a straight line parallel to the original diagonal, and the areas of the lands are unchanged, AE must be the same length as the original diagonal.
   - The original diagonal length can be found using the properties of the right triangle formed by the rectangle.
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem: 
     - Diagonal length = sqrt((AB + CD)^2 + BC^2)
     - Diagonal length = sqrt((30 + 10)^2 + 24^2)
     - Diagonal length = sqrt(40^2 + 24^2)
     - Diagonal length = sqrt(1600 + 576)
     - Diagonal length = sqrt(2176)
     - Diagonal length ≈ 46.65 meters

6. **Determine the distance from D to E:**
   - Since AE is 46.65 meters and AD is 64 meters, the distance from D to E is:
     - DE = AD - AE
     - DE = 64 m - 46.65 m
     - DE ≈ 17.35 m

7. **Compare with given options:**
   - The closest option to 17.35 meters is 16 meters.

**Reasoning**: The geometric properties and Pythagorean theorem were used to find the diagonal length and the distance from D to E. The closest option to the calculated distance is 16 meters.

**Answer**: E)
