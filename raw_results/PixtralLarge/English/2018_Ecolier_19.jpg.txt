To solve this problem, we need to find a path through the rooms such that each room Eva enters has a number higher than the previous one. Let's analyze the paths step-by-step:

1. Eva enters through the main entrance, which is at room 6.
2. From room 6, she can move to room 9 (since 9 > 6).
3. From room 9, she can move to room 10 (since 10 > 9).
4. From room 10, she can move to room 12 (since 12 > 10).

Now, let's check the possible exit doors:
- Door A: Room 9 (possible since Eva can go from 6 to 9)
- Door B: Room 14 (not possible because there is no path from 14 that ensures all previous rooms have higher numbers)
- Door C: Room 10 (possible since Eva can go from 9 to 10)
- Door D: Room 12 (possible since Eva can go from 10 to 12)
- Door E: Room 9 (possible since Eva can go from 6 to 9)

The only door that fits the criteria of each room having a number higher than the previous one and allows Eva to exit is Door D.

Reasoning: The path 6 -> 9 -> 10 -> 12 fits the criteria of each room having a higher number than the previous one, and Eva can exit through Door D.

Answer: D).
