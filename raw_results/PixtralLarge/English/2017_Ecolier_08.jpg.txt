To determine which picture shows Anna's house from the back, let's consider the information provided:

- From the front, Anna's house has a door on the left side and two windows on the right side.
- From the back, the house has three windows but no door.

We need to identify the correct back view of the house based on these criteria.

**Reasoning**:
1. The front view of Anna's house has a door on the left and two windows on the right.
2. The back view must have three windows and no door.

By examining the options provided:
- Option A shows a door on the left and two windows on the right.
- Option B shows a door on the right and two windows on the left.
- Option C shows three windows and no door.
- Option D shows two windows and no door.
- Option E shows three windows and no door.

Given that the back view must have three windows and no door, options A, B, and D can be eliminated because they either have a door or fewer than three windows.

Options C and E both have three windows and no door. However, since the front view has the door on the left, the back view should not have a door on the right (as seen in option B). Therefore, option E, which has three windows and no door, is the correct choice.

**Answer**: E).
