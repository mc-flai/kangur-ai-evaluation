**Reasoning**: The flag of Kangoroland is a rectangle split into three equal rectangles. The image shows a vertical split into three parts, which means the white rectangle (the middle section) has a width that is one-third of the total width of the rectangle, and its height is the same as the total height of the rectangle.

To find the ratio of the side lengths of the white rectangle, we consider the dimensions of the entire flag. Since the flag is split into three equal vertical parts, the ratio of the width of the white rectangle to its height is the same as the ratio of one part to the total height.

Given the options, the only ratio that fits this description is 2:3, because the white rectangleâ€™s width is one-third of the entire flag's width, and the height remains the same.

**Answer**: B)
