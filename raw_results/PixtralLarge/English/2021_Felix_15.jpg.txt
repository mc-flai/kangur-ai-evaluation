To determine which house is Eva's, let's analyze the route to the school and the information provided:

1. The school is the largest building in the picture.
2. Doris and Ali walk past Leo's house on their way to school.
3. Eva walks past Chole's house on her way to school.

Let's examine the diagram. The paths from each house to the school are clearly marked.

- For Leo's house, we need to find the paths of Doris and Ali.
- For Chole's house, we need to find the path of Eva.

Looking at the paths:
- The yellow house (B) has a path directly leading to the school without passing by any other house.
- The house with the green roof (C) has a path that passes by the house with the orange roof (D) before reaching the school.
- The house with the orange roof (D) has a path that passes by the yellow house (B) before reaching the school.
- The gray house (A) has a path that passes by the blue house (E) before reaching the school.
- The blue house (E) has a path that passes by the green-roofed house (C) before reaching the school.

Given that Eva walks past Chole's house, we need to find a path where Eva's house is located such that it passes by another house on its way to the school. The blue house (E) fits this description as its path passes by the green-roofed house (C) before reaching the school.

Therefore, Eva's house is the blue house (E).

Reasoning: By analyzing the paths, we deduced that Eva's house must be the one whose path passes by Chole's house before reaching the school. The blue house (E) meets this criterion as its path passes by the green-roofed house (C).

Answer: E).
