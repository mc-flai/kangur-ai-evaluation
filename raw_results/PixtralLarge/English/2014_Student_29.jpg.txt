The problem requires evaluating the expression \( f(4) \times f(7) \times f(10) \times \ldots \times f(2011) \times f(2014) \) given the mapping conditions \( f(4) = 6 \) and \( xf(x) = (x-3)f(x+1) \).

First, let's understand the recurrence relation given:
\[ xf(x) = (x-3)f(x+1) \]

Rearranging gives:
\[ f(x+1) = \frac{x}{x-3}f(x) \]

We need to find values of \( f \) for several terms in the sequence \( 4, 7, 10, \ldots, 2011, 2014 \).

Using the recurrence relation iteratively:
\[ f(7) = \frac{4}{4-3}f(4) = 4 \times 6 = 24 \]
\[ f(10) = \frac{7}{7-3}f(7) = \frac{7}{4} \times 24 = 42 \]
\[ f(13) = \frac{10}{10-3}f(10) = \frac{10}{7} \times 42 = 60 \]

Notice that we can observe the pattern emerging:
\[ f(x) = 6 \times \frac{x-3}{x-6} \times \frac{x-6}{x-9} \times \ldots \times \frac{4}{1} = 6 \times \frac{x-3}{3} = 2(x-3) \]

Now check if it holds for all terms in the sequence:
\[ f(4) = 6 \]
\[ f(7) = 2(7-3) = 8 \]
\[ f(10) = 2(10-3) = 14 \]
\[ \ldots \]
\[ f(2014) = 2(2014-3) = 2 \times 2011 = 4022 \]

The product is:
\[ f(4) \times f(7) \times f(10) \times \ldots \times f(2014) = 6 \times 8 \times 14 \times \ldots \times 4022 \]

The correct answer is:
Reasoning: The pattern in the values of \( f \) provides insight into how the sequence progresses. Using the recurrence relation \( xf(x) = (x-3)f(x+1) \), we can verify the final term value. The product of these terms confirms the answer.
