To determine how many people P2016 shook hands with, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 2016 people at the conference, numbered P1 to P2016.
2. Each person has shaken hands with a number of people equal to their own system number.
3. Therefore, P1 has shaken hands with 1 person, P2 with 2 people, P3 with 3 people, and so on.
4. This means P2016 has shaken hands with 2016 people, but since one cannot shake hands with themselves, we need to exclude P2016 from their count.
5. Hence, P2016 has shaken hands with 2015 other people.

Reasoning: P2016 has shaken hands with 2015 other people because one cannot shake hands with themselves.
Answer: E).
