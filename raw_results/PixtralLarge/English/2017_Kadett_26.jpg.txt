**Reasoning**:
1. The given sequence starts as 2, 3, 6, 8, 8, ...
2. According to the rule, the first two digits are 2 and 3.
3. Every subsequent digit is the unit digit of the product of the two previous digits.
4. To find the 2017th digit, let's identify the pattern in the sequence:
   - 2, 3 (initial digits)
   - 2 * 3 = 6 (unit digit is 6)
   - 3 * 6 = 18 (unit digit is 8)
   - 6 * 8 = 48 (unit digit is 8)
   - 8 * 8 = 64 (unit digit is 4)
   - 8 * 4 = 32 (unit digit is 2)
   - 4 * 2 = 8 (unit digit is 8)
   - 2 * 8 = 16 (unit digit is 6)
   - 8 * 6 = 48 (unit digit is 8)
   - 6 * 8 = 48 (unit digit is 8)
   - 8 * 8 = 64 (unit digit is 4)
5. The sequence repeats every 6 digits: 2, 3, 6, 8, 8, 4.
6. To find the 2017th digit, we find the remainder of 2017 divided by 6:
   - 2017 รท 6 = 336 remainder 1.
7. The remainder 1 indicates that the 2017th digit is the same as the first digit in the repeating sequence.
8. The first digit of the repeating sequence is 2.

**Answer**: A).
