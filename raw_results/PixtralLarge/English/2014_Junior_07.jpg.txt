**Reasoning**: The statement "Everybody has solved more than 20 problems" is false. To determine which statement is definitely correct, we need to find the option that logically follows from this premise.

- Option A) "Nobody has solved more than 20 problems." This must be true if the original statement is false because if even one person had solved more than 20 problems, the original statement would be true.
- Option B) "Somebody has solved less than 21 problems." This is not necessarily true since people could have solved exactly 20 or more than 21 problems.
- Option C) "Everybody has solved less than 21 problems." This is not necessarily true because not everyone has to solve less than 21 problems; they could have solved exactly 20 or more than 21 problems.
- Option D) "Somebody has solved exactly 20 problems." This is not necessarily true because the original statement does not specify the exact number of problems solved.
- Option E) "Somebody has solved more than 20 problems." This contradicts the false nature of the original statement.

Given the original statement is false, the only statement that must be true is that "Nobody has solved more than 20 problems."

**Answer**: A)
