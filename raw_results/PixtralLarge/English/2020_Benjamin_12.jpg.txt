**Reasoning**: Elisa left the cave at 10:20 at night and came back at 10:20 in the morning. To determine how long she stayed out of the cave, we assume she left at night and returned the next morning at the same time.

The time from 10:20 PM to midnight is:
- 11:20 PM - 10:20 PM = 1 hour
- 12:00 AM - 11:20 PM = 40 minutes
So, total time from 10:20 PM to midnight = 1 hour + 40 minutes = 100 minutes

The time from midnight to 10:20 AM the next morning is:
- 10 hours (from 12:00 AM to 10:00 AM) and
- 20 minutes (from 10:00 AM to 10:20 AM)
So, total time from midnight to 10:20 AM = 10 hours + 20 minutes = 620 minutes

Adding both periods:
- 100 minutes + 620 minutes = 720 minutes
- Converting 720 minutes to hours: 720 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 12 hours

Thus, Elisa stayed out of the cave for 12 hours.
