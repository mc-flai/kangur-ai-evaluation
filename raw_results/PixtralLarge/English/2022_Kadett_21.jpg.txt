To solve the problem, we need to determine the number that Jenny writes into the cell in the fourth corner of the 3x3 table. We'll use the information that the sums of the four numbers in each 2x2 area of the table are the same and that the numbers in three of the corner cells are already provided: 2, 4, and 3.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:

1. **Sum of the 2x2 Areas**:
    - The numbers in the corners are 2, 4, and 3.
    - We need to determine the sum of the numbers in each 2x2 area.

2. **Possible 2x2 Areas**:
    - Let's label the unknown numbers in the table as follows:
      ```
      A B C
      D E F
      G H I
      ```
    - We know:
      ```
      A = 2, B = ?, C = 4
      D = ?, E = ?, F = ?
      G = ?, H = ?, I = 3
      ```

3. **Sum Equation**:
    - Consider the 2x2 area that includes the number 2 (top-left corner):
      ```
      2 + B + D + E
      ```
    - Consider the 2x2 area that includes the number 4 (top-right corner):
      ```
      B + 4 + E + F
      ```
    - Consider the 2x2 area that includes the number 3 (bottom-right corner):
      ```
      D + E + F + 3
      ```
    - Consider the 2x2 area that includes the number in the fourth corner (bottom-left corner):
      ```
      2 + D + G + H
      ```

4. **Equal Sums**:
    - The sums of the numbers in these 2x2 areas must be equal.
    - Let the sum be S.

5. **Solving for the Fourth Corner**:
    - From the given numbers, we can set up the equations:
      ```
      2 + B + D + E = S
      B + 4 + E + F = S
      D + E + F + 3 = S
      2 + D + G + H = S
      ```
    - By comparing these equations, we can solve for the unknown numbers.

6. **Finding the Fourth Corner Number**:
    - Let's assume the fourth corner number is X.
    - The sum of the numbers in the 2x2 area including X must equal S.
    - By substituting the known values and solving the equations, we find that the fourth corner number is 1.

**Reasoning**: The sum of the numbers in the 2x2 areas must be equal, and by substituting the known values and solving the equations, we find that the fourth corner number is 1.
**Answer**: B).
