**Reasoning**:

1. The king travels at a speed of 5 km/h and sends messengers back to the castle at a speed of 10 km/h.
2. To determine the time difference between two consecutive messengers arriving at the castle, we need to calculate how long it takes for the second messenger to catch up to the first messenger's position.
3. Suppose the first messenger is sent at time t=0. By the time the king sends the second messenger, one hour has passed.
4. In this hour, the first messenger has traveled 10 km (since speed = 10 km/h).
5. Meanwhile, the king has traveled 5 km (since speed = 5 km/h).
6. When the second messenger is sent, he starts from a point 5 km closer to the castle than where the first messenger started.
7. The distance the second messenger needs to cover to reach the same position as the first messenger is 10 km - 5 km = 5 km.
8. Since the second messenger travels at a speed of 10 km/h, it will take him (5 km) / (10 km/h) = 0.5 hours to cover this distance.
9. Therefore, the time difference between two consecutive messengers arriving at the castle is 0.5 hours, which is 30 minutes.
