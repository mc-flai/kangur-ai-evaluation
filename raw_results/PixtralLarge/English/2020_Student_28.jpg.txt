To determine how many cards Maria must take out of the box to ensure that among the cards taken there are two with numbers a and b such that a is not a divisor of b and b is not a divisor of a, we need to consider the properties of divisors.

1. Each divisor of 2020 is either even or odd. If the numbers a and b have different parities (one is odd and the other is even), then they cannot be divisors of each other.
2. The prime factorization of 2020 is 2^2 * 5 * 101. This means that each divisor of 2020 can contain 0, 1, or 2 factors of 2.
3. If Maria takes out 9 cards, it is possible that all these cards could be divisors of 2020 that are either all odd or all even, meaning they could all be divisors of each other in some way.
4. However, if Maria takes out 10 cards, then by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least two cards that contain different numbers of factors of 2.
5. Therefore, these two cards must have different parities, ensuring that one number is not a divisor of the other.

Reasoning: By applying the pigeonhole principle and considering the parity of divisors, Maria must take out at least 10 cards to ensure that there are two numbers a and b such that a is not a divisor of b and b is not a divisor of a.
