**Reasoning**: Luisa draws a star and then cuts out a piece from the middle of the drawing. The piece removed from the center would have the lines of the star converging at the center but without the outer part of the star. This means the piece will show the inner part of the star with the lines converging towards the center.

Among the options provided:
- (A) shows the center with fewer and thicker lines.
- (B) shows more lines converging towards the center and is the closest representation of the inner part of the star.
- (C) shows a more detailed star-like pattern but with more segments than the drawing.
- (D) shows more lines but with a different pattern.
- (E) shows a pattern that is different from the center of the star.

Option (B) best matches the description of the inner part of the star with the lines converging towards the center.

**Answer**: B).
