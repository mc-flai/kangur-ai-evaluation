**Reasoning**:
In question 17, there are five balls in the box: four chocolate balls and one boiled sweet. Johann and Maria are taking turns to draw a ball without replacement. Johann starts first.

To find the probability that Maria wins, we need to consider the scenarios in which Maria gets the boiled sweet. Johann can draw a ball first, and Maria can get the boiled sweet on her turn. Since Johann draws first, he has a 4/5 chance of drawing a chocolate ball (since there are 4 chocolate balls out of 5 total balls), leaving the boiled sweet for Maria.

If Johann draws the boiled sweet first (which has a 1/5 chance), Maria does not win. Therefore, the probability that Maria wins is the probability that Johann draws a chocolate ball on his first turn, which is 4/5.

**Answer**: B) 4/5.
