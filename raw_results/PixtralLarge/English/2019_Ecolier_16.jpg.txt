**Reasoning**: The question asks how much the two pieces of fruit cost together based on the given images.

1. In the first image, the apple costs 5 Taler and the pear costs 3 Taler. Together they cost 5 + 3 = 8 Taler.
2. In the second image, the banana costs 7 Taler and the apple costs 2 Taler. Together they cost 7 + 2 = 9 Taler.
3. In the third image, the pear costs 10 Taler and the banana costs 0 Taler. Together they cost 10 + 0 = 10 Taler.
4. In the last image, the pear costs 10 Taler, the banana costs 1 Taler, and the apple costs 1 Taler. Together they cost 10 + 1 + 1 = 12 Taler.

From the above calculations, the combined cost of the two fruits shown in the final image is 12 Taler.
