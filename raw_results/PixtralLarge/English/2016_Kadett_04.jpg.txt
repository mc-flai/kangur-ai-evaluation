**Reasoning**: Jim should have added 26 to a certain number, but instead, he subtracted 26 and obtained -14.

To find the number he should have added 26 to, we first determine the number he subtracted 26 from to get -14:

Let x be the number before subtraction:
x - 26 = -14

Add 26 to both sides to find x:
x = -14 + 26
x = 12

Now, we find the result Jim would have obtained if he had added 26 to this number:
12 + 26 = 38
