**Reasoning**:
1. We know that three-eighths (3/8) of the students in the class swim.
2. This means that 3/8 of the total number of students is equal to the number of students who swim.
3. Additionally, there are exactly five students who swim and dance.
4. Since 3/8 of the total students should be an integer, the total number of students in the class must be a multiple of 8.
5. We need to find the smallest multiple of 8 that is at least 5 more than three-eighths of the total number of students (since there are 5 students who both swim and dance).

Let's denote the total number of students as N.
- 3/8 * N = number of students who swim.
- This number must be an integer, so N must be a multiple of 8.
- Checking the options:
   - (A) 16: 3/8 * 16 = 6. This doesn't work since there are 5 students who both swim and dance, so the number of students who only swim would be 1, which is less than 5.
   - (B) 24: 3/8 * 24 = 9. This doesn't work since there are 5 students who both swim and dance, so the number of students who only swim would be 4, which is less than 5.
   - (C) 32: 3/8 * 32 = 12. This works because there are 5 students who both swim and dance, so the number of students who only swim would be 7, which is at least 5.
   - (D) 40: 3/8 * 40 = 15. This works but is more than necessary as 32 already satisfies the condition.
   - (E) 48: 3/8 * 48 = 18. This works but is more than necessary as 32 already satisfies the condition.

So, the smallest multiple of 8 that satisfies the condition is 32.
