**Reasoning**: Ana lights a candle every 10 minutes, and each candle lasts 40 minutes. To determine how many candles are lit after 55 minutes, we need to calculate the number of candles that have been lit and how long each has been burning.

1. First candle: Lit at 0 minutes, will be burning at 55 minutes (55 minutes < 40 minutes + 40 minutes).
2. Second candle: Lit at 10 minutes, will be burning at 55 minutes (45 minutes < 40 minutes + 10 minutes).
3. Third candle: Lit at 20 minutes, will be burning at 55 minutes (35 minutes < 40 minutes).
4. Fourth candle: Lit at 30 minutes, will be burning at 55 minutes (25 minutes < 40 minutes).
5. Fifth candle: Lit at 40 minutes, will be burning at 55 minutes (15 minutes < 40 minutes).
6. Sixth candle: Lit at 50 minutes, will be burning at 55 minutes (5 minutes < 40 minutes).

Hence, a total of 6 candles will be lit after 55 minutes.
