The tablecloth is composed of small squares, and we need to determine what fraction of the entire tablecloth is covered by black squares.

The tablecloth appears to be divided into a grid with equally sized squares, some of which are black and some white. By counting the number of black squares and comparing it to the total number of squares, we can determine the fraction of the tablecloth that is black.

Let's count the squares:
- The grid is 5 squares by 5 squares, so there are 25 squares in total.
- Counting the black squares, we see there are 8 black squares.

To find the percentage of the tablecloth that is black, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of black squares}}{\text{Total number of squares}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{8}{25} \right) \times 100 = 32\% \]

Therefore, the part of the whole tablecloth that is black is 32%.

Reasoning: By counting the black squares and using the formula to find the percentage, we determine that 32% of the tablecloth is black.
