To determine the number in the circle with the question mark, we first need to establish the sums of all the numbers placed in the circles.

Given:
- The sum of the four numbers in the left column is 24.
- The sum of the four numbers in the right column is 24.
- The sum of the three numbers in the bottom row is 25.

Let's denote the unknown number in the bottom row by x. We can now set up an equation to solve for x. 

The bottom row consists of three numbers: 24 (from the left column), x (the unknown number), and 24 (from the right column). The sum of these numbers is given as 25.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 24 + x + 24 = 25 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 48 + x = 25 \]

Subtract 48 from both sides:
\[ x = 25 - 48 \]
\[ x = -23 \]

Since the question mark is in the bottom row, and we have already established that the sum of the numbers in the bottom row is 25, we can conclude that the unknown number must be -23.

Option E) another number is the correct answer, as none of the provided numbers (2, 4, 5, 6) fit our calculation.

Reasoning: The given sums and the placement of the numbers lead us to calculate that the unknown number must be -23.

Answer: E).
