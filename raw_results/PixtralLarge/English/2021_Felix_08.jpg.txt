**Reasoning**:
1. We need to find a constellation where all stars have a number greater than 3.
2. We calculate the sum of the numbers in each constellation to verify that it equals 20.
3. Let's examine each option:
   - (A): Numbers are 7, 4, 9. Sum = 7 + 4 + 9 = 20. All numbers are greater than 3.
   - (B): Numbers are 5, 8, 7. Sum = 5 + 8 + 7 = 20. All numbers are greater than 3.
   - (C): Numbers are 5, 8, 7. Sum = 5 + 8 + 7 = 20. All numbers are greater than 3.
   - (D): Numbers are 5, 4, 9, 2. Sum = 5 + 4 + 9 + 2 = 20. Number 2 is not greater than 3.
   - (E): Numbers are 12, 4, 4. Sum = 12 + 4 + 4 = 20. Number 4 is not greater than 3.

Based on the analysis, the only valid constellation where all numbers are greater than 3 and their sum is 20 are options A, B, and C. However, since we are asked to choose one, let's select the first one that meets the criteria.

**Answer**: A).
