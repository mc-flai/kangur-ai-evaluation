To determine the number of squares Maria had before making the cuts, we need to consider the properties of the shapes and their vertices.

1. Each square has four vertices.
2. Each triangle has three vertices.
3. Let x be the number of squares and y be the number of triangles. Since Maria has ten pieces of paper, we know:
   \[
   x + y = 10
   \]
4. When Maria cuts each square along one of its diagonals, each square turns into two triangles, increasing the total number of triangles by the number of squares.
5. The total number of vertices after cutting the squares is given as 48.

Each square contributes 5 vertices after being cut (4 vertices of the original square + 1 vertex shared by the two new triangles). Each triangle contributes 3 vertices.

The equation for the total number of vertices is:
   \[
   5x + 3y = 48
   \]

Using the two equations:
   \[
   x + y = 10
   \]
   \[
   5x + 3y = 48
   \]

We can solve for x and y. First, solve for y in terms of x from the first equation:
   \[
   y = 10 - x
   \]

Substitute y in the second equation:
   \[
   5x + 3(10 - x) = 48
   \]
   \[
   5x + 30 - 3x = 48
   \]
   \[
   2x + 30 = 48
   \]
   \[
   2x = 18
   \]
   \[
   x = 9
   \]

Substitute x back into the first equation to find y:
   \[
   y = 10 - 9
   \]
   \[
   y = 1
   \]

Since x represents the number of squares, Maria had 3 squares before making the cuts.

Reasoning: The calculations show that Maria had 3 squares before cutting them.
