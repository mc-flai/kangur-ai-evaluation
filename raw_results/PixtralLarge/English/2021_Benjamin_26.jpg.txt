To determine the correct combination of the bike lock, we need to understand how the digits change when each part is turned the same amount in the same direction.

1. The initial combination is 6348.
2. If each part of the lock is turned the same amount in the same direction, each digit will either increase or decrease by the same amount.

Let's analyze the options given:
   - **A) 8560**: This is not possible as all digits cannot increase by the same amount from 6348 without one digit exceeding 9.
   - **B) 3015**: This is not possible as all digits cannot decrease by the same amount from 6348 without one digit going below 0.
   - **C) 4906**: This is possible if each digit is decreased by 3 (mod 10).
   - **D) 1893**: This is not possible as all digits cannot decrease by the same amount from 6348 without one digit going below 0.
   - **E) 0782**: This is not possible as all digits cannot decrease by the same amount from 6348 without one digit going below 0.

Upon closer inspection, option **C) 4906** is the only combination that could result from each digit being decreased by the same amount (in this case, 3). Each digit from the original combination 6348 decreased by 3 gives us 4906.

Reasoning: By analyzing the changes in digits, option C) is the only combination where each digit is decreased by the same amount from the original combination 6348.
Answer: C).
