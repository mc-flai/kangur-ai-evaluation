**Reasoning**:
1. Benjamin starts with a number and performs a series of operations on it.
2. To determine divisibility by 3, we need to consider the properties of the operations and the initial number.
3. The operations performed are: +1, +1, ⋅3, +2, ⋅2.
4. Adding 1 to a number does not change its divisibility by 3.
5. Multiplying by 3 makes the result divisible by 3.
6. Adding 2 to a number does not change its divisibility by 3.
7. Multiplying by 2 does not change its divisibility by 3.
8. Therefore, the crucial operation for determining divisibility by 3 is the multiplication by 3.
9. Since any number multiplied by 3 is divisible by 3, the number after the ⋅3 operation will always be divisible by 3.
10. Thus, the number in the circle after the ⋅3 operation is divisible by 3.
11. There is only one number in the sequence that is guaranteed to be divisible by 3 due to the multiplication by 3 operation.

**Answer**: A).
