To determine the correct answer for question 20, we need to analyze the pattern created by the six paper strips from behind. Specifically, the question asks us to consider which arrangement of strips would be visible when looking at the pattern from the reverse side.

When looking at a weave from behind, the strips that were over in the front view will be under in the back view, and vice versa. This means we need to invert the pattern. Let's break it down:

1. Identify the strips that are over and under in the front view.
2. Invert the positions of these strips.

Let's examine the given pattern in the front view:
- The top horizontal strip goes under the first vertical strip, over the second vertical strip, and under the third vertical strip.
- The middle horizontal strip goes over the first vertical strip, under the second vertical strip, and over the third vertical strip.
- The bottom horizontal strip goes under the first vertical strip, over the second vertical strip, and under the third vertical strip.

For the back view:
- The top horizontal strip should go over the first vertical strip, under the second vertical strip, and over the third vertical strip.
- The middle horizontal strip should go under the first vertical strip, over the second vertical strip, and under the third vertical strip.
- The bottom horizontal strip should go over the first vertical strip, under the second vertical strip, and over the third vertical strip.

Comparing this with the options:
- Option A) does not match.
- Option B) matches the described back view pattern.
- Option C) does not match.
- Option D) does not match.
- Option E) does not match.

Reasoning: By inverting the strips' positions from the front view to the back view, we see that option B) correctly represents the pattern seen from behind.

Answer: B)
