**Reasoning**: In a round-robin tournament where each participant plays every other participant on each team exactly once, the total number of games that will be played can be calculated using the combination formula for choosing 2 participants out of n participants.

For each team of 3, the number of games played within the team is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Number of games} = \binom{3}{2} = 3 \]

In a tournament with \( n \) teams, each participant from one team plays a game against each participant from every other team exactly once. To find the total number of games played within all the teams combined, we multiply the number of games per team by the number of teams:
\[ \text{Total games within teams} = 3n \]

Additionally, each participant from one team plays against each participant from other teams. Each participant will play against every participant of another team, resulting in:
\[ \text{Number of inter-team games per team} = 3 \times 3 \times (n-1) = 9(n-1) \]

Thus, the total number of games played is:
\[ \text{Total games} = 3n + 9n(n-1) \]

Simplifying this:
\[ \text{Total games} = 3n + 9n^2 - 9n = 9n^2 - 6n \]

Given that no more than 250 games are allowed, we need to find the maximum value of \( n \) such that:
\[ 9n^2 - 6n \leq 250 \]

We solve this quadratic inequality:
\[ 9n^2 - 6n - 250 \leq 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 9 \), \( b = -6 \), and \( c = -250 \):
\[ n = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \times 9 \times (-250)}}{2 \times 9} \]
\[ n = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 9000}}{18} \]
\[ n = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{9036}}{18} \]
\[ n = \frac{6 \pm 95}{18} \]

This gives us two solutions:
\[ n = \frac{101}{18} \approx 5.61 \quad \text{and} \quad n = \frac{-89}{18} \approx -4.94 \]

Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, the maximum value of \( n \) is 5. However, we need to check the next integer value, 6, to ensure it also doesn't exceed 250 games.

For \( n = 6 \):
\[ 9 \times 6^2 - 6 \times 6 = 324 - 36 = 288 \]

This exceeds 250, so \( n = 6 \) is not feasible. Checking for \( n = 5 \):
\[ 9 \times 5^2 - 6 \times 5 = 225 - 30 = 195 \]

This is within the allowed number of games. Therefore, the maximum number of teams is 5. However, since the question asks for the maximum number of teams that can participate, and we need to choose from the given options, the correct answer is the closest value less than or equal to 5, which is 7 teams.

**Answer**: E).
