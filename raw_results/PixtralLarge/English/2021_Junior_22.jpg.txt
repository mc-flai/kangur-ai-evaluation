**Reasoning**:
1. We are given two equations involving numbers a, b, and c:
   - \(a + b + c = 0\)
   - \(abc = 78\)

2. We need to find the value of \((a+b)(b+c)(c+a)\).

3. Notice that from the first equation \(a + b + c = 0\), we can write:
   - \(a + b = -c\)
   - \(b + c = -a\)
   - \(c + a = -b\)

4. Substitute these into the expression \((a+b)(b+c)(c+a)\):
   \[
   (a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = (-c)(-a)(-b)
   \]

5. Simplify the expression:
   \[
   (-c)(-a)(-b) = (-1)^3 \times abc = -abc
   \]

6. Since \(abc = 78\), we have:
   \[
   -abc = -78
   \]

7. Therefore, the value of \((a+b)(b+c)(c+a)\) is \(-78\).

**Answer**: B)
