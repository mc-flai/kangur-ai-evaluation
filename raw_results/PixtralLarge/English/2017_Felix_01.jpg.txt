Sure, let's analyze question 1 from the image.

Ellen has 6 stickers to decorate the butterfly. The stickers are of different sizes and colors:
- 2 large black stickers
- 2 medium gray stickers
- 2 small light gray stickers

The butterfly has two wings, so we need to ensure that each sticker is used in a way that maintains symmetry across both wings.

Checking the options:
- (A) 2 large black stickers, 2 large pink stickers, 2 small cyan stickers.
- (B) 2 large black stickers, 2 medium gray stickers, 2 small cyan stickers.
- (C) 2 large black stickers, 2 medium cyan stickers, 2 small black stickers.
- (D) 2 large black stickers, 2 large pink stickers, 2 medium gray stickers.
- (E) 2 large black stickers, 2 medium gray stickers, 2 small cyan stickers.

Upon closer inspection:
- Option (A) uses large pink stickers which we don’t have.
- Option (B) uses only the stickers we have and arranges them symmetrically.
- Option (C) uses small black stickers which we don’t have.
- Option (D) uses large pink stickers which we don’t have.
- Option (E) uses small cyan stickers which we don’t have.

Only option (B) uses the exact stickers available and arranges them symmetrically on both wings.

Reasoning: We need to match the given stickers with the butterfly options and ensure that the stickers match the provided ones in terms of size and color, and they must be placed symmetrically on the wings.

Answer: B).
