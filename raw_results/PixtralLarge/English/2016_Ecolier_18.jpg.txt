**Reasoning**: 
1. Tick, Trick, and Track are triplets, so they must be the same age.
2. Their brother Franz is exactly 3 years older than the triplets.
3. All four children are having their birthdays today.
4. If we assume the triplets are x years old, then Franz must be x + 3 years old.
5. The only option where the age difference between the triplets and Franz is exactly 3 years is 27 (Franz is 30 and the triplets are 27).

**Answer**: D).
