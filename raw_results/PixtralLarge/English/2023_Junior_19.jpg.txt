To determine the shaded area in grey, we need to calculate the area of the square and subtract the areas of the circles contained within it.

1. **Calculate the area of the big square**:
   \[ \text{Area of the square} = \text{side length}^2 = 30 \, \text{cm} \times 30 \, \text{cm} = 900 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

2. **Calculate the areas of the three circles**:
   - Circle with radius 5 cm:
     \[ \text{Area} = \pi \times (5 \, \text{cm})^2 = 25\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \]
   - Circle with radius 4 cm:
     \[ \text{Area} = \pi \times (4 \, \text{cm})^2 = 16\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \]
   - Circle with radius 3 cm:
     \[ \text{Area} = \pi \times (3 \, \text{cm})^2 = 9\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \]

3. **Total area of the circles**:
   \[ \text{Total area of the circles} = 25\pi + 16\pi + 9\pi = 50\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \]

4. **Calculate the shaded area**:
   \[ \text{Shaded area} = \text{Area of the square} - \text{Total area of the circles} \]
   \[ \text{Shaded area} = 900 \, \text{cm}^2 - 50\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \]

By examining the options provided, we find that option E matches this expression.

Reasoning: We calculated the area of the square and subtracted the areas of the three circles to find the shaded area.

Answer: E).
