To solve for the length of side AD in the convex quadrilateral ABCD with perpendicular diagonals, we use the Pythagorean theorem. The diagonals of a quadrilateral that are perpendicular intersect at a right angle, allowing us to treat the quadrilateral as two right triangles.

Given:
- AB = 2017
- BC = 2018
- CD = 2019

We can split the problem into two right triangles: triangle ABD and triangle BCD.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangles ABD and BCD:

1. For triangle ABD:
\[ AD^2 = AB^2 + BD^2 \]

2. For triangle BCD:
\[ AD^2 = CD^2 + BD^2 \]

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, BD is the common side for both triangles.

Let's denote BD as x. Then we have:
\[ AD^2 = 2017^2 + x^2 \]
\[ AD^2 = 2019^2 + x^2 \]

Equating the two expressions for AD, we get:
\[ 2017^2 + x^2 = 2019^2 + x^2 \]

Simplifying:
\[ 2017^2 = 2019^2 \]

Calculating the difference:
\[ 2019^2 - 2017^2 = (2019 - 2017)(2019 + 2017) = 2(4036) = 8072 \]

Therefore, the correct length of AD is:
\[ \sqrt{2020^2 - 4} = \sqrt{2019^2 + 1} = 2019 \]

Thus, the correct answer is C), \(\sqrt{2020^2 - 4}\).

Reasoning: Using the Pythagorean theorem and the properties of perpendicular diagonals in a quadrilateral, we can determine the length of side AD.
