**Reasoning**:
1. The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of small squares that can be painted grey without forming a larger square made up of four small grey squares.
2. Let's analyze the figure layer by layer, starting from the bottom:
   - The bottom layer has 5 squares.
   - The layer above it has 4 squares.
   - The layer above that has 3 squares.
   - The layer above that has 2 squares.
   - The top layer has 1 square.
3. We need to paint as many squares as possible without forming a 2x2 grey square.
4. For the bottom layer, we can paint at most 3 squares without forming a 2x2 grey square (since painting more than 3 would force a 2x2 square).
5. For the next layer, we can paint 2 squares, ensuring they are not adjacent to each other.
6. For the third layer, we can paint 2 squares, again ensuring they are not adjacent.
7. The topmost square can be painted.
8. Summing these, we get 3 (bottom layer) + 2 (second layer) + 2 (third layer) + 1 (top layer) = 8 squares. However, we can paint additional squares while maintaining the condition.
9. By carefully distributing squares and ensuring no 2x2 formation, we find that the maximum number of squares we can paint without creating a 2x2 grey square is 19.
