**Reasoning**: Maria first had to run to the underground (subway), which implies a higher speed, and she exited after two stops, meaning a brief period of high speed followed by a stop. After exiting, she walked the rest of the way to school, which implies a lower, consistent speed compared to running. 

- Diagram (A) shows a high initial speed followed by a lower speed, which does not match the description as it lacks the stopping and resuming.
- Diagram (B) includes an initial high speed, a stop, and then a consistent lower speed, which fits the description well.
- Diagram (C) starts with a high speed but does not show a consistent lower speed after the stop.
- Diagram (D) does not show any initial high speed.
- Diagram (E) shows inconsistent speeds and does not match the description of a lower consistent speed after the stop.

Diagram (B) best describes Maria's journey to school.

**Answer**: B).
