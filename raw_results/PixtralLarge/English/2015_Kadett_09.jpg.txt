**Reasoning**:
1. Let's denote the area of the square as S.
2. When a corner of the square is folded into the middle of the square, it forms a pentagon.
3. The area of this pentagon is part of the area of the square, and according to the problem, both areas are consecutive whole numbers.
4. The area of the pentagon is S - 1 (since itâ€™s a whole number less than the area of the square).
5. Hence, the area of the square must be one more than the area of the pentagon.
6. Checking the given options, 16 is the only option that is a whole number and one more than another whole number (which is 15).

**Answer**: D)
