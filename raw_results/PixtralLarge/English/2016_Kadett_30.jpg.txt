To determine the 6th face of the cube, we need to analyze the given information:
1. The cube has a side length of 3, consisting of a total of 27 unit cubes.
2. Out of these, 15 are black and 12 are white.
3. Five of the six faces of the cube are shown in the diagram.

We need to figure out which of the given options (A, B, C, D, E) is the 6th face of the cube.

Let's start by observing the visible faces:
- The first face has 4 black units and 5 white units.
- The second face has 4 black units and 5 white units.
- The third face has 2 black units and 7 white units.
- The fourth face has 4 black units and 5 white units.
- The fifth face has 1 black unit and 8 white units.

Adding up the black units from the five visible faces:
4 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 15

Since we have a total of 15 black units in the cube, and we’ve already counted 15 black units in the five visible faces, the 6th face must have 0 black units.

Now, adding up the white units from the five visible faces:
5 + 5 + 7 + 5 + 8 = 30

Since we have a total of 12 white units in the cube, and we’ve counted 30 white units in the five visible faces, there is an overlap of white units because each unit cube shares faces with adjacent unit cubes. The 6th face must balance out the count to ensure a total of 12 white units overall.

Given that the 6th face must have 0 black units, we look at the options:
- Option A has 1 black unit.
- Option B has 4 black units.
- Option C has 4 black units.
- Option D has 2 black units.
- Option E has 0 black units.

Therefore, the only option that fits our criteria is option E.

Reasoning: The 6th face must have 0 black units to match the total count of black and white units in the cube, as calculated from the visible faces.
Answer: E).
