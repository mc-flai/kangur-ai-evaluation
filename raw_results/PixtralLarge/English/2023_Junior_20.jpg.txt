Let's analyze question 20. The question asks for the smallest possible number of the arithmetic mean of five different prime numbers.

**Reasoning**:
1. Prime numbers are integers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.
2. The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers is calculated by summing all the numbers and dividing by the number of elements in the set.
3. For the arithmetic mean to be an integer, the sum of the prime numbers must be divisible by the number of prime numbers (in this case, 5).
4. To find the smallest possible arithmetic mean, we should start with the smallest prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.
5. Calculate the sum of these prime numbers:
   \(2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 = 28\).
6. Calculate the arithmetic mean:
   \(\frac{28}{5} = 5.6\), which is not an integer.
7. We need to find the next smallest set of five different prime numbers that result in an integer arithmetic mean.
8. Next, consider including the next smallest prime number, 13, instead of 2:
   \(3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).
9. Calculate the sum of these prime numbers:
   \(3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 39\).
10. Calculate the arithmetic mean:
    \(\frac{39}{5} = 7.8\), which is not an integer.
11. Continue this process until finding a set of five different prime numbers whose sum is divisible by 5.
12. Consider the set \(5, 7, 11, 13, 17\):
    \(5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 = 53\), which is not divisible by 5.
13. Continue until we find a set whose sum is divisible by 5.
14. The smallest set of five different prime numbers that gives an integer arithmetic mean is  \(5, 7, 11, 17, 19\):
    \(5 + 7 + 11 + 17 + 19 = 59\), which is not divisible by 5.
15. Continue until we find a set whose sum is divisible by 5.
16. Consider the set \(5, 11, 17, 23, 29\):
    \(5 + 11 + 17 + 23 + 29 = 85\).
17. Calculate the arithmetic mean:
    \(\frac{85}{5} = 17\), which is an integer.
18. Therefore, the smallest possible arithmetic mean of five different prime numbers is 17.
19. However, since the options given only go up to 9, we need to reevaluate our approach.
20. The smallest set of five different prime numbers that gives an integer arithmetic mean is \(5, 11, 17, 23, 29\), but since this results in an arithmetic mean of 17, which is not an option, we need to find a smaller set.
21. Consider the set \(5, 11, 17, 19, 23\):
    \(5 + 11 + 17 + 19 + 23 = 75\).
