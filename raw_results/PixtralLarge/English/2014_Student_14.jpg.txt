The problem asks for the number of whole number triples \((a, b, c)\) with \(a > b > c > 1\) that satisfy the condition \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} > 1\).

**Reasoning:**

1. Let's first consider \(c\). Since \(a > b > c > 1\), the smallest value \(c\) can take is 2. We will start with \(c = 2\) and then consider higher values if necessary.

2. If \(c = 2\), then \(b\) must be greater than 2. The smallest integer greater than 2 is 3.

3. Now, if \(b = 3\), then \(a\) must be greater than 3. The smallest integer greater than 3 is 4.

4. We now check if the triple \((4, 3, 2)\) satisfies the condition:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{6}{12} = \frac{13}{12} > 1
   \]
   This triple satisfies the condition.

5. Next, we need to check if there are other possible triples. If we increase \(c\) to 3, then:
   - \(b\) must be greater than 3, so the smallest \(b\) is 4,
   - \(a\) must be greater than 4, so the smallest \(a\) is 5.

6. Check if the triple \((5, 4, 3)\) satisfies the condition:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{12}{60} + \frac{15}{60} + \frac{20}{60} = \frac{47}{60} < 1
   \]
   This triple does not satisfy the condition.

7. Since increasing \(c\) results in fewer and larger denominators, the sums will only get smaller. Hence, no other triples can satisfy the condition.

**Answer:** B)
