**Reasoning**:
To find the number of small dice with exactly four faces colored, we need to consider the dice's position in the structure. Dice with four faces colored are typically the ones that are on the edges but not at the corners. The corners will have three faces colored, and the central dice (if any) will have fewer faces colored.

1. **Identify the structure**:
   The structure consists of 12 glued-together dice. The arrangement appears to be a 3x3 base with additional layers on top, forming a stepped pattern.

2. **Count the edge dice**:
   - The bottom layer has 3x3 = 9 dice. Out of these, the 4 corner dice have three faces colored.
   - The 4 edge dice (excluding corners) in the bottom layer will have four faces colored.
   - The second layer has 2x2 = 4 dice. Out of these, the 2 edge dice (excluding corners) will have four faces colored.
   - The third layer has 1 die, which will have three faces colored as it is a corner.

3. **Summarize the count**:
   - Bottom layer: 4 edge dice with four faces colored.
   - Second layer: 2 edge dice with four faces colored.
   - Total = 4 (bottom layer) + 2 (second layer) = 6 edge dice with four faces colored.

However, reconsidering the structure's visibility, the dice at the edges of layers above the bottom layer may not be fully visible. Therefore, we need to reassess:

   - Only the bottom layer's 4 edge dice have four faces colored.
   - The stepped pattern on the upper layer does not fully expose the edges of the dice above the bottom layer.

Thus, the correct count is 4 edge dice with exactly four faces colored.

**Answer**: C).
