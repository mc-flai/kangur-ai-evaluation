To determine the percentage of the triangle's area that is colored in grey, we need to analyze the given diagram. The triangle is divided into four smaller triangles of equal area. Out of these four smaller triangles, three of them are colored in grey.

To find the percentage of the area that is colored in grey, we can use the following calculation:

(Number of grey triangles / Total number of triangles) * 100%

= (3 / 4) * 100%
= 0.75 * 100%
= 75%

However, none of the given options directly match this result. To understand this discrepancy, consider whether the question might be asking for an approximate percentage. Given that 75% is closest to 80%, we can infer that the question might be expecting an approximate answer or there could be a slight error in the calculation assumptions.

Given options:
A) 80%
B) 85%
C) 88%
D) 90%
E) It cannot be calculated

Reasoning: Out of the given options, 80% is the closest estimate to the calculated 75%.

Answer: A)
