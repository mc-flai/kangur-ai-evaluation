**Reasoning**: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the sum of 25% of 2018 and 2018% of 25.

First, calculate 25% of 2018:
25% of 2018 = (25/100) * 2018 = 0.25 * 2018 = 504.5

Next, calculate 2018% of 25:
2018% of 25 = (2018/100) * 25 = 20.18 * 25 = 504.5

Now, sum the two results:
504.5 + 504.5 = 1009

**Answer**: A)
