To determine which two circles Peter definitely has to color in the same color, we need to analyze the graph. Recall the constraints:
1. Peter colors each of the eight circles in one of three colors: red, yellow, or blue.
2. Two circles that are directly connected by a line cannot be of the same color.

Let's denote the circles by their numbers and analyze the connections:

- Circle 1 is connected to circles 2, 5, and 6.
- Circle 2 is connected to circles 1, 3, and 7.
- Circle 3 is connected to circles 2 and 4.
- Circle 4 is connected to circle 3.
- Circle 5 is connected to circles 1 and 6.
- Circle 6 is connected to circles 1, 5, and 7.
- Circle 7 is connected to circles 2 and 6.
- Circle 8 is connected to circle 5.

We need to find two circles that must be the same color due to these constraints.

Reasoning:
1. Circle 4 and Circle 5 are not directly connected to each other.
2. Circle 4 is only connected to Circle 3, while Circle 5 is connected to Circles 1, 6, and 8.
3. Since Circle 4 and Circle 5 are not directly connected and have no common neighbors, they must be the same color.
