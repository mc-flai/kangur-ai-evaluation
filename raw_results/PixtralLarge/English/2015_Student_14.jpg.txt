To determine which of the numbers \(a, b, c, d, e\) is the largest, we need to analyze the given relationships:

1. \(b = c\)
2. \(e, d = a + b\)
3. \(a = e - d\)

Let's analyze these relationships step by step:

1. Since \(b = c\), \(b\) and \(c\) are equal.
2. \(e, d = a + b\) implies both \(e\) and \(d\) are equal to \(a + b\).
3. \(a = e - d\).

From the equation \(e, d = a + b\), we know \(e = a + b\) and \(d = a + b\).

Next, consider \(a = e - d\). Since \(e = d\), substituting \(e\) for \(d\) in the equation \(a = e - d\) gives \(a = e - e = 0\). However, since \(a\) is a positive whole number, this is a contradiction. Therefore, \(e\) must be greater than \(d\) for \(a\) to be a positive whole number.

Given that \(e\) and \(d\) are equal to \(a + b\), and \(a = e - d\), it implies \(e\) must be the largest number because it is equal to \(a + b\) and must be greater than \(d\) for \(a\) to be positive.

Reasoning: \(e\) is the largest number because it is equal to \(a + b\) and must be greater than \(d\) for \(a\) to be a positive whole number.
