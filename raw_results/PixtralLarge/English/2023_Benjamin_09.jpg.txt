To determine which picture Jan cannot obtain by sticking the three pieces of paper on top of the black circle, let's analyze the shapes and sizes of the pieces and the black circle.

1. **Identify the pieces**:
   - The first piece is a semicircle (half of a circle).
   - The second piece is a quarter circle (one-fourth of a circle).
   - The third piece is another quarter circle (one-fourth of a circle).

2. **Analyze the options**:
   - Option A: This configuration has three pieces, but it doesn't seem to use a semicircle.
   - Option B: This configuration has three pieces, and one of them is a semicircle.
   - Option C: This configuration contains multiple pieces, but there is no semicircle.
   - Option D: This configuration contains a semicircle and two quarter circles.
   - Option E: This configuration has multiple pieces, but there is no semicircle.

3. **Determine which configuration is impossible**:
   - Option A and E do not have a semicircle, so they are not possible.
   - Option C does not have a semicircle either, so it is also not possible.
   - Option B has a semicircle, but it's not clear if it can be achieved with the given pieces.
   - Option D has a semicircle and two quarter circles, matching the given pieces.

Given the pieces Jan has, the configuration in option C is impossible because it does not include a semicircle.

Reasoning: Option C does not contain a semicircle, which is one of the pieces Jan has.
Answer: C).
