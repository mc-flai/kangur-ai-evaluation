To determine which cars will crash into each other, we need to analyze the movement of each car based on the arrows provided in the diagram.

1. **Car 1** is moving upwards.
2. **Car 2** is moving to the right.
3. **Car 3** is moving downwards.
4. **Car 4** is moving to the left.

We need to identify any intersections in the paths of these cars within the next 5 seconds.

- **Car 1** and **Car 2**: Car 1 is moving upwards, and Car 2 is moving to the right. Their paths do not intersect.
- **Car 1** and **Car 3**: Car 1 is moving upwards, and Car 3 is moving downwards. Their paths are directly opposite and will intersect if they are on the same line.
- **Car 1** and **Car 4**: Car 1 is moving upwards, and Car 4 is moving to the left. Their paths do not intersect.
- **Car 2** and **Car 3**: Car 2 is moving to the right, and Car 3 is moving downwards. Their paths do not intersect.
- **Car 3** and **Car 4**: Car 3 is moving downwards, and Car 4 is moving to the left. Their paths do not intersect.

Based on this analysis, the only potential collision is between Car 1 and Car 3.

Reasoning: Car 1 and Car 3 are moving in opposite directions on the same line and will crash into each other.
