**Reasoning**: 
- In a multiplication magic square, the products of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal are equal.
- Given numbers: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100.
- The partially filled magic square shows '20' and '1.'
- Since the product of the numbers along any row, column, or diagonal must be the same, we need to find a number that, when multiplied with '20' and '1,' gives a product that can be achieved with the given numbers.
- Let's denote the missing number as 'x.'
- The product along the diagonal containing '20' and '1' would be 20 * 1 * x = 20x.
- For the diagonal containing '20,' '1,' and 'x' to have the same product as other rows, columns, and diagonals, 20x must be a product of some combination of the given numbers.
- Notice that 20 * 1 * 5 = 100, which is a product of the given numbers. Thus, x must be 5.
