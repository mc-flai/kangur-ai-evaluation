**Reasoning**: The problem states that the angle bisectors of the rectangle split the opposite long side into three pieces. Since the angle bisectors are drawn from the ends of the selected long side (11 cm), they will intersect the opposite long side at points that divide it into three segments. Given that the rectangle is symmetric, each segment will be equal.

To determine the length of each segment, divide the total length of the opposite side (11 cm) by 3:

11 cm / 3 = 3.67 cm (approximately)

However, the options given do not match this exact value, so we need to find the closest approximation. The closest option to 3.67 cm is 4 cm.

**Answer**: D)
