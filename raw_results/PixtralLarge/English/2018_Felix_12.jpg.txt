**Reasoning:**
To solve this problem, we need to form two-digit numbers using the digits 2, 0, 1, and 8, such that the numbers are greater than 10 and smaller than 25. Additionally, each number must consist of two different digits.

First, we identify the possible digits for the tens place. Since the number must be greater than 10 and smaller than 25, the tens digit must be either 1 or 2.

Next, we list all the possible numbers:
- If the tens digit is 1, the possible numbers are: 10, 12, and 18.
- If the tens digit is 2, the possible numbers are: 20, 21, and 28.

However, 10 and 28 are not valid because they do not have two different digits. Therefore, the valid numbers are: 12, 18, 20, and 21.

So, there are 4 different numbers that meet the criteria.

**Answer:** A)
