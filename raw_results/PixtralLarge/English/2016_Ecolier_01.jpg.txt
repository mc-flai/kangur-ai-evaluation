To determine who has got the biggest total from throwing two dice, we need to add the numbers on the dice for each person.

1. **Amy**: The dice show 5 and 1.
   - Total for Amy: 5 + 1 = 6

2. **Bert**: The dice show 2 and 3.
   - Total for Bert: 2 + 3 = 5

3. **Carl**: The dice show 4 and 1.
   - Total for Carl: 4 + 1 = 5

4. **Doris**: The dice show 6 and 6.
   - Total for Doris: 6 + 6 = 12

5. **Ernst**: The dice show 6 and 5.
   - Total for Ernst: 6 + 5 = 11

From the calculations above, Doris has the highest total of 12.

**Reasoning**: 
Doris's total of 12 is the highest among all the totals calculated.
