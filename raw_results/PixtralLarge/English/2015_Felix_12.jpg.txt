**Reasoning**:
1. Each building block consists of 5 little cubes.
2. There are 6 building blocks in total.
3. Each building block appears to follow a pattern with an equal number of white and grey cubes that don't touch each other.
4. Observing the pattern, each building block has 3 white cubes and 2 grey cubes.
5. Total number of white cubes = Number of building blocks * Number of white cubes in each block
                         = 6 * 3
                         = 18.
