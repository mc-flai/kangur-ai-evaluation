To solve this problem, we need to find the missing number in the circle marked with a question mark such that the sum of the numbers in the five circles around each house equals 20.

Let's start with the left house:
- The numbers around the left house are 6, 2, and 5.
- The missing number for the left house is \( x \) such that \( 6 + 2 + 5 + x = 20 \).
- Solving for \( x \):
\[ 13 + x = 20 \]
\[ x = 7 \]

Now let's consider the right house:
- The numbers around the right house are 3, 7, and 1.
- The missing number for the right house is \( y \) such that \( 3 + 7 + 1 + y = 20 \).
- Solving for \( y \):
\[ 11 + y = 20 \]
\[ y = 9 \]

Thus, the number that the question mark stands for is 9.

Reasoning: The sum of the numbers around each house must be 20. By calculating the missing numbers for both houses, we find that the missing number represented by the question mark is 9.

Answer: D).
