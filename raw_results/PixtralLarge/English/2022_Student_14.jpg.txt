**Reasoning**:
1. The shaded quadrilateral is described to have an area of 3 and its vertices are the midpoints of the sides of the smaller squares.
2. Since the vertices are the midpoints of the sides of the smaller squares, each smaller square is divided into four smaller triangles, each with an area of 1.5 (as the total area of each smaller square is 6, and they are divided equally into four triangles).
3. The shaded quadrilateral is composed of four such triangles (one from each smaller square).
4. Therefore, the area of the shaded quadrilateral is 4 * 1.5 = 6.
5. The total area of the big square is the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares and the two rectangles. The area of each smaller square is 6, and each rectangle has an area of 3 (since they are halves of the squares).
6. Therefore, the total area of the big square is 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 = 18.
7. The area of the non-shaded part of the big square is the total area of the big square minus the area of the shaded quadrilateral.
8. Hence, the area of the non-shaded part is 18 - 3 = 15.
