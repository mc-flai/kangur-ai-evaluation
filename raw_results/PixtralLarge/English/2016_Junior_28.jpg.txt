**Reasoning**:
1. The problem states that the person who skis sits to the left of Sandra.
2. The person who ice skates sits opposite Benjamin.
3. Eva and Philipp sit next to each other.
4. A woman sits next to the person who plays hockey.

Let's analyze the positions based on these clues:

- If Sandra is a woman, then the person who plays hockey must be next to her.
- Since Eva and Philipp sit next to each other, and Philipp is a man, it implies that Eva must be the woman who sits next to the hockey player.
- Since the person who ice skates sits opposite Benjamin, and Eva and Philipp are sitting next to each other, Eva cannot be the ice skater.
- Given that Eva cannot be the ice skater or the hockey player, and we already established that she must sit next to the hockey player, the only sport left for Eva is skiing.

**Answer**: B)
