**Reasoning**: To determine which number of pieces Alex cannot obtain by cutting the ropes, we need to consider the lengths of the ropes and how they can be divided into equal pieces.

- The 1 m rope can be divided into pieces of length 1/n for any positive integer n.
- The 2 m rope can be divided into pieces of length 2/m for any positive integer m.

To find the number of pieces Alex cannot obtain, we look for a number that cannot be achieved by dividing either rope into equal pieces.

- The 1 m rope can provide pieces in lengths such as 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, etc.
- The 2 m rope can provide pieces in lengths such as 2/1, 2/2, 2/3, etc.

The number of pieces is determined by the denominators of these fractions. We need to find a number of pieces that cannot be formed by either the 1 m or the 2 m rope.

- For the 1 m rope, possible pieces are any positive integer.
- For the 2 m rope, possible pieces are any positive integer.

However, the number of pieces must be a common multiple of the lengths of the ropes. The lengths are 1 m and 2 m, so the possible number of pieces must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of 1 and 2, which is 2.

The given options are 6, 8, 9, 12, and 15. We need to find which of these cannot be obtained by dividing the ropes into equal lengths.

- 6 pieces: Possible (1/6 m and 2/6 m)
- 8 pieces: Possible (1/8 m and 2/8 m)
- 9 pieces: Not possible (9 is not a multiple of 2)
- 12 pieces: Possible (1/12 m and 2/12 m)
- 15 pieces: Not possible (15 is not a multiple of 2)

Therefore, the number of pieces that Alex cannot obtain is 9.
