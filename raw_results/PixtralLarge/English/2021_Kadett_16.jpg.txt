To determine the value of \( h \), we need to recognize that the configuration of the squares forms a larger square. Each square's side length must be equal to the side length of the others.

1. Let the side length of the small square be \( s \).
2. Given the area of the small square is 1, we have \( s^2 = 1 \). Solving for \( s \), we get \( s = 1 \) (since \( s \) must be positive).
3. The large square is composed of the small square and other squares. The side length of the large square is made up of two smaller square sides and one side of the indicated smaller square.
4. Therefore, the total side length of the large square is \( 3s \).
5. Since \( s = 1 \), the side length of the large square is \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \).

Thus, the value of \( h \) is 3 meters.

Reasoning: The side length of the small square is 1, and the large square's side length is made up of three smaller square sides, making it 3 meters.
