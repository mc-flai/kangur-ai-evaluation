**Reasoning**:
1. We are given five numbers \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\) with a sum \(S\).
2. It is known that \(a_k = k + S\) for \(1 \leq k \leq 5\).
3. Let's calculate the sum \(S\) using the given formula:
   - \(a_1 = 1 + S\)
   - \(a_2 = 2 + S\)
   - \(a_3 = 3 + S\)
   - \(a_4 = 4 + S\)
   - \(a_5 = 5 + S\)
4. The sum of these five numbers is:
   \[a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = (1 + S) + (2 + S) + (3 + S) + (4 + S) + (5 + S)\]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) + 5S = 15 + 5S\]
6. Since the sum of these five numbers is \(S\), we have:
   \[S = 15 + 5S\]
7. Solving for \(S\):
   \[S - 5S = 15\]
   \[-4S = 15\]
   \[S = -\frac{15}{4}\]
