**Reasoning**: According to the problem, Konrad gets 1 kg of dried mushrooms from 4 kg of fresh mushrooms. This means that the ratio of fresh mushrooms to dried mushrooms is 4:1. To get 4 kg of dried mushrooms, we need to determine how many kilograms of fresh mushrooms correspond to this ratio.

We can set up a proportion:
4 kg fresh mushrooms / 1 kg dried mushrooms = x kg fresh mushrooms / 4 kg dried mushrooms

Solving for x:
4 / 1 = x / 4
x = 4 * 4
x = 16 kg

Therefore, Konrad needs to pick 16 kg of fresh mushrooms to get 4 kg of dried mushrooms.

**Answer**: B) 16 kg
