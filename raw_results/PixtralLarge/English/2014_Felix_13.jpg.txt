To determine which shape cannot be made from the four pieces shown, we need to analyze each of the given shapes and see if the pieces can form them.

1. **Shape A (Hexagon)**: 
   - The four pieces can be arranged to form a hexagon by positioning the triangular pieces appropriately around a center square.

2. **Shape B (Triangle)**:
   - The four pieces can be arranged to form a large triangle by combining the triangular pieces along with the square piece.

3. **Shape C (Arrowhead)**:
   - The four pieces can also be arranged to form an arrow-like shape by aligning the triangles and the square piece in a linear fashion.

4. **Shape D (Irregular shape)**:
   - The four pieces can be arranged in a complex manner to form the irregular shape shown.

5. **Shape E (Arrowhead variant)**:
   - The four pieces can form this shape similarly to Shape C, by aligning the triangles and the square piece in a linear fashion but with a different configuration.

However, the shape in the question itself (the square cut into four pieces) cannot be reassembled into any of the options because the four pieces shown are derived from a square. The original shape (the square) is not one of the answer choices.

Reasoning: The four pieces shown in the question are derived from a square, and the original square shape is not among the options provided.

Answer: None of the given options.
