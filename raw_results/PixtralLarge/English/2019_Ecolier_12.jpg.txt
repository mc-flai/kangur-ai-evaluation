The image shows two balance scales with weights and dogs. The first balance has one dog on one side and a 12 kg weight on the other side, indicating that the weight of the dog is 12 kg. The second balance has two dogs on one side and a 20 kg weight on the other side, indicating that the combined weight of the two dogs is 20 kg. Since the dogs are equally heavy, the weight of one dog can be found by dividing the 20 kg by 2.

**Reasoning**:
- One dog weighs 12 kg (from the first balance).
- Two dogs together weigh 20 kg (from the second balance).
- Therefore, one dogâ€™s weight from the second balance is 20 kg / 2 = 10 kg.
- Since all dogs are equally heavy, the weight of one dog is 10 kg.

**Answer**: D).
