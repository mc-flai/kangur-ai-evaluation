To determine the area of the shaded grey region, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total area of the rectangle**:
   The rectangle has a height of 6 cm and a base of 12 cm (since the base of the triangle is the same as the base of the rectangle).
   Total area of the rectangle = height × base = 6 cm × 12 cm = 72 cm².

2. **Calculate the area of the triangle**:
   The triangle is half of the rectangle, so its area is half of the area of the rectangle.
   Area of the triangle = 1/2 × area of the rectangle = 1/2 × 72 cm² = 36 cm².

3. **Determine the shaded area**:
   The shaded area is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the triangle.
   Shaded area = area of rectangle - area of triangle = 72 cm² - 36 cm² = 36 cm².

4. **Identify the correct answer from the options**:
   The options are:
   (A) 10 cm²
   (B) 12 cm²
   (C) 14 cm²
   (D) 15 cm²
   (E) 21 cm²

   None of the given options matches 36 cm². Therefore, it seems there might be an error in the problem or the options provided.

Reasoning: Based on the given diagram and calculations, the shaded area should be 36 cm², but since none of the options match this value, the question may contain an error.

Answer: None of the provided options match the calculated shaded area.
