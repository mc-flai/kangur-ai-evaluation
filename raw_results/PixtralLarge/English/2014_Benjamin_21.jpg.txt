**Reasoning**:
1. Identify the positions adjacent to the number 6. The numbers adjacent to 6 are those directly to the left, right, above, and below it.
2. Since the table is 3x3, and we know the digits 1 to 9 are used, we can determine the positions of these numbers.
3. Considering the partially filled table, the positions around 6 will be:
   - Top: 9
   - Left: 8
   - Right: 7
   - Bottom: 3
4. Adding these adjacent numbers to 6: 9 + 8 + 7 + 3 = 27.

**Answer**: D).
