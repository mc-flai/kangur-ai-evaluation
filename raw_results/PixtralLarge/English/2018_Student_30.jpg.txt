**Reasoning**:
1. The problem states that Archimedes has calculated 15! and the result is displayed on the board.
2. Two of the digits in this result, the second and the tenth, cannot be read.
3. We need to determine the two missing digits.

Let's calculate 15! first:

15! = 15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1

Performing the multiplication, we get:
15! = 1,307,674,368,000

4. Comparing this result with the number on the board, we can see the positions of the missing digits. The second digit is a 3 and the tenth digit is a 4.
5. Therefore, the correct answer should match these digits.

**Answer**: C)
