**Reasoning**: 
When a gear rotates clockwise, the adjacent gears will rotate counterclockwise, and vice versa. This pattern continues for each subsequent gear. Therefore, if the smallest gear (purple) turns a full turn clockwise, the next gear (blue) will turn a full turn counterclockwise, and the last gear (red) will turn a full turn clockwise again.

We need to identify the picture where the black teeth on the gears align correctly after these rotations.

- The smallest gear (purple) has turned fully clockwise, so its black tooth should be in the position as it originally was.
- The middle gear (blue) has turned fully counterclockwise, so its black tooth should be in the position as it originally was.
- The largest gear (red) has turned fully clockwise, so its black tooth should be in the position as it originally was.

We observe each option:
- (A) The black teeth are not in the correct positions.
- (B) The black teeth are not in the correct positions.
- (C) The black teeth are in the correct positions.
- (D) The black teeth are not in the correct positions.
- (E) The black teeth are not in the correct positions.

Thus, the correct answer is (C).

**Answer**: C).
