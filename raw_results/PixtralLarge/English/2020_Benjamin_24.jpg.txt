To determine which set of weights balances the third scale, we need to compare the weights on both sides.

1. **First Scale Analysis**:
   - Left side: 2 yellow squares + 1 triangle.
   - Right side: 1 blue circle + 1 triangle.
   - This implies: 2 yellow squares = 1 blue circle.

2. **Second Scale Analysis**:
   - Left side: 2 yellow squares.
   - Right side: 1 blue circle + 1 triangle.
   - This implies: 2 yellow squares = 1 blue circle + 1 triangle.

   From the first scale, we know that 2 yellow squares = 1 blue circle. Therefore, on the right side of the second scale, the triangle must weigh 0.

3. **Third Scale Analysis**:
   - Left side: 3 yellow squares.
   - Right side: ?

   From the first and second scales, we know:
   - 2 yellow squares = 1 blue circle.

   Therefore:
   - 3 yellow squares = 1.5 blue circles.

   The correct combination that balances this would be:
   - 1 blue circle + 1 triangle (because the triangle weighs 0).

   This matches option (D).

Reasoning: By analyzing the first two scales, we deduced the values of the weights and applied them to the third scale to find the correct balance.

Answer: D).
