**Reasoning**:
1. Rebecca starts with a square piece of paper and folds it twice. This means the paper was folded in half along one axis and then folded in half again along the other axis, resulting in a smaller square that is a quarter of the original size.
2. She then cuts off one corner of the folded square. When she unfolds the paper, this single cut will manifest in four places due to the two folds.
3. Visualizing the cut: Every fold divides the paper into smaller sections, and the cut will appear in each of these sections. Since the cut was made in one corner of the smallest folded square, it will create a symmetrical pattern when unfolded.
4. Considering the options provided:
   - (A) shows a small square cut from the middle of the original square, which would imply the cut was made in the center of the folded paper.
   - (B) shows a diamond shape in the center, which implies a different kind of symmetrical cut.
   - (C) shows a diamond shape oriented 45 degrees to the square, which would not result from cutting the corner of a folded square.
   - (D) shows a cross shape, which is not possible from cutting just one corner.
   - (E) shows a diamond-shaped cut in the center, with symmetrical cuts in each quadrant, which is consistent with cutting one corner of a twice-folded square.

**Answer**: E).
