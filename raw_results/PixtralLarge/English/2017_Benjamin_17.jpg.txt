To determine which big cube is possible given the building block, we need to analyze each option to see if it adheres to the pattern of alternating colors. The building block is a 1x1x1 cube with a specific color pattern on its faces.

1. **Option A)**:
   - Each face of the big cube shows a pattern that is consistent with the building block.
   - The color alternation matches the building block pattern on all visible faces.

2. **Option B)**:
   - The pattern on the front face and the right face does not match the building block.
   - The color alternation is incorrect, making it impossible.

3. **Option C)**:
   - The visible faces show patterns that correctly follow the building block's alternation.
   - The pattern is consistent and matches the building block on all visible sides.

4. **Option D)**:
   - The right face does not have the correct color alternation.
   - The pattern is inconsistent with the building block, making it impossible.

5. **Option E)**:
   - The back face has an incorrect pattern that does not match the building block.
   - The color alternation is incorrect, making it impossible.

After examining each option, options A and C are the only ones that correctly follow the building block's pattern on all visible faces.

Reasoning: By analyzing the color patterns on each face of the big cubes, we can determine that options A and C are the only ones that consistently match the building block's pattern.
Answer: A).
