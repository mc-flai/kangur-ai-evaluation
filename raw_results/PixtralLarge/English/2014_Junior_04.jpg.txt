**Reasoning**:
To find the number that is an equal distance from 2/3 and 4/5 on the number line, we need to calculate the average of these two fractions.

First, convert 2/3 and 4/5 to a common denominator:
2/3 = 10/15
4/5 = 12/15

Next, calculate the average:
(10/15 + 12/15) / 2 = 22/15 / 2 = 11/15

**Answer**: A) 11/15
