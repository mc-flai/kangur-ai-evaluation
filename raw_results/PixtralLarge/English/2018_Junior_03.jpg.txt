**Reasoning**: To determine the length of the third side of a triangle, we use the triangle inequality theorem. This theorem states that the length of any side of a triangle is less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides and greater than the difference of the lengths of the other two sides.

Given the lengths of two sides are 5 and 2, the length of the third side must be:

- Greater than 5 - 2 = 3
- Less than 5 + 2 = 7

This means the third side must be between 3 and 7. Among the given options, the only odd whole number in that range is 5.

**Answer**: C)
