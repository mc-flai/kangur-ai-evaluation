To determine which of the pictures is not Sophie, let's analyze the characteristics of Sophie shown on the right side of the image in question 5:

1. Sophie has 5 black spots on her wings.
2. Sophie has a black head.
3. Sophie has 6 legs.

Now, let's compare each option (A through E) with the reference picture of Sophie:

- **Option (A)**:
  - 5 black spots.
  - Black head.
  - 6 legs.
  - Matches Sophie.

- **Option (B)**:
  - 5 black spots.
  - Black head.
  - 6 legs.
  - Matches Sophie.

- **Option (C)**:
  - 5 black spots.
  - Black head.
  - 6 legs.
  - Matches Sophie.

- **Option (D)**:
  - This option has only 4 black spots (1 missing).
  - Black head.
  - 6 legs.
  - Does not match Sophie.

- **Option (E)**:
  - 5 black spots.
  - Black head.
  - 6 legs.
  - Matches Sophie.

From the analysis, the picture in option (D) does not match Sophie because it has one fewer black spot.

Reasoning: The picture in option (D) has only 4 black spots instead of 5, which does not match the characteristics of Sophie.
Answer: D).
