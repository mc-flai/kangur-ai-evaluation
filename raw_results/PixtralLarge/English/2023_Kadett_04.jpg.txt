**Reasoning**: John initially has 150 coins. Out of these, 60 show "head," and the remaining 90 show "tail." To have an equal number of "head" and "tail" coins, he needs to turn over some of the "tail" coins to get a total of 75 "head" and 75 "tail." 

Since there are already 60 "head" coins, he needs to turn over additional "tail" coins to reach 75 "head" coins. To find out how many coins he needs to turn over, we calculate:

75 (desired number of "head") - 60 (current number of "head") = 15.

So, John needs to turn over 15 "tail" coins to "head."

**Answer**: B).
