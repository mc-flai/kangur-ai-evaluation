To solve question 10, we need to determine the midpoints of the line segments AB and CD.

1. **Determine the length of AB**:
    - Given that A is 12 cm from C and B is 18 cm from D, we can infer that the total length of the line segment CD is AC + BD = 12 cm + 18 cm = 30 cm.
    - The midpoint of CD is at 30 cm / 2 = 15 cm.

2. **Determine the midpoints of AB and CD**:
    - The midpoint of AB is halfway between A and B. Since A is 12 cm from C, the midpoint of AB will be 12 cm + (distance AB / 2).
    - Similarly, the midpoint of CD is halfway between C and D, which is at 15 cm (as calculated above).

3. **Calculate the distance between the midpoints**:
    - The midpoint of AB is 12 cm + (distance AB / 2).
    - The midpoint of CD is 15 cm.
    - The distance between the midpoints of AB and CD is the absolute difference between these two values.

Since the midpoint of CD is at 15 cm, and we need to find how far apart the midpoints are, the answer must be 15 cm.

Reasoning: The midpoint of CD is at 15 cm, and the distance between the midpoints of AB and CD is the absolute difference, which is 15 cm.

Answer: E).
