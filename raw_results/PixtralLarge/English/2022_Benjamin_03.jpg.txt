To determine where the laser beam leaves the picture on the right, we need to carefully trace its path based on the reflections shown in the small picture on the left.

- Starting from the entry point on the left, the laser beam first strikes the bottom mirror and gets reflected upwards.
- It then strikes the top mirror and gets reflected to the right.
- Next, it strikes the vertical mirror on the right and gets reflected downwards.
- It then strikes the bottom mirror again and gets reflected to the right.
- Finally, it exits the setup.

By following the path of the laser beam step-by-step and ensuring that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection at each mirror, we can see that the laser beam leaves the picture at point D.

Reasoning: The laser beam reflects off the mirrors in the following order: bottom, top, right, bottom, and exits at the rightmost side.

Answer: D).
