**Reasoning:**
- The problem states that 45 teachers represent 60% of all teachers at Anna's school.
- To find the total number of teachers, we set up the equation: 0.60 * Total Teachers = 45.
- Solving for Total Teachers, we get Total Teachers = 45 / 0.60 = 75.
- Next, we need to determine how many teachers come to school by car, which is 12% of the total teachers.
- Calculating 12% of 75, we get 0.12 * 75 = 9.

**Answer:** C).
