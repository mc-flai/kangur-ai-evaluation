**Reasoning:**

1. Mike is sitting in the 18th compartment behind the engine, which is in the 3rd carriage. This means there are 6 compartments per carriage (since 18 divided by 3 equals 6).
2. Joanna is sitting in the 50th compartment behind the engine, which is in the 7th carriage. This confirms that there are 6 compartments per carriage (since 50 divided by 7 is approximately 7.14, and 7 x 7 = 49).

Thus, each carriage has 8 compartments.

**Answer:** B)
