To determine the page number of the last page based on the given information, we need to analyze the occurrences of the digits 0 and 8. 

1. **Understanding the Occurrences of Digits**:
   - The digit 0 appears six times.
   - The digit 8 appears seven times.
   
2. **Analyzing the Digit Occurrences**:
   - We need to figure out how these digits can be distributed across the page numbers.
   - Since we are looking for the last page, we need to consider the highest possible page numbers where the digits 0 and 8 can appear.

3. **Counting the Digits**:
   - Let's consider the possible page numbers where 0 and 8 can appear up to 98:
     - 0 appears in: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90.
     - 8 appears in: 8, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, and possibly 98 (if it exists).

4. **Matching the Counts**:
   - For 0 to appear six times, we need to consider the pages up to around 60 (since 0 appears in 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60).
   - For 8 to appear seven times, we need to consider the pages up to around 78 (since 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, and 78).

5. **Determining the Last Page**:
   - If the last page were 98, 8 would appear eight times (8, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98) and 0 would appear nine times (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90).
   - If the last page were 78, 8 would appear seven times (8, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78) and 0 would appear six times (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The only number that fits both conditions (0 appearing six times and 8 appearing seven times) is 78.

Reasoning: The digit 0 appears six times and the digit 8 appears seven times, which matches the conditions if the last page number is 78.

Answer: D).
