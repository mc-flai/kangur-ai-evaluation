**Reasoning**: The question asks us to determine the actual height of Benjamin's brother based on a model in HO scale. The HO scale ratio is 1:87, meaning 1 cm in the model represents 87 cm in reality. Benjamin owns a 2 cm high model of his brother, so to find the actual height, we multiply the model height by the scale factor.

Calculation:
Model height = 2 cm
Scale factor = 87
Actual height = Model height * Scale factor = 2 cm * 87 = 174 cm
Convert centimeters to meters: 174 cm = 1.74 meters

**Answer**: A)
