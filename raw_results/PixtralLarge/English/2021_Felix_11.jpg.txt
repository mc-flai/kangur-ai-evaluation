To determine how many more points Angela scored than Julie, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total points Julie scored.
   - Julie scored 5 goals.
   - Each goal is worth 2 points.
   - Therefore, Julie's total points = 5 goals × 2 points/goal = 10 points.

2. Calculate the total points Angela scored.
   - Angela scored 9 goals.
   - Each goal is worth 2 points.
   - Therefore, Angela's total points = 9 goals × 2 points/goal = 18 points.

3. Determine the difference in points between Angela and Julie.
   - Angela's points = 18 points.
   - Julie's points = 10 points.
   - Difference = Angela's points - Julie's points = 18 points - 10 points = 8 points.

Based on the calculations above, Angela scored 8 more points than Julie.
