To determine which of the given numbers is not a factor of \(18^{2017} + 18^{2018}\), we first need to factor out the common term in the expression.

1. **Factor out \(18^{2017}\) from the expression**:
   \[
   18^{2017} + 18^{2018} = 18^{2017} (1 + 18) = 18^{2017} \times 19
   \]

2. **Analyze the factored form**:
   The expression simplifies to \(18^{2017} \times 19\). This means the factors of this expression include all factors of \(18^{2017}\) and the number 19.

3. **Check each option to see if it is a factor**:
   - (A) 8:  \(18\) is even, so \(18^{2017}\) is also even. Since \(18^{2017} \times 19\) involves multiplication by an even number, 8 is potentially a factor.
   - (B) 18: Clearly a factor since \(18^{2017}\) is a factor.
   - (C) 28: 28 is not a factor of 18 nor 19. It is not related to the prime factors of \(18^{2017} \times 19\).
   - (D) 38: 38 is not a factor of 18 nor 19. It is not related to the prime factors of \(18^{2017} \times 19\).
   - (E) 48: 48 is not a factor of 19, and though \(18^{2017}\) is even, it is not a simple multiple of 48.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Since 28 (option C) is not a factor of either 18 or 19, it is not a factor of \(18^{2017} \times 19\).

Reasoning: \(18^{2017} + 18^{2018} = 18^{2017} \times 19\). The number 28 is not a factor of 18 or 19, so it cannot be a factor of the product.
Answer: C).
