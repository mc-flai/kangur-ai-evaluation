To determine which kangaroo card can be turned around to look the same as the card shown on the right, we need to consider the orientation and position of the kangaroo in each option.

1. **Identify the target orientation:** The kangaroo in the target card on the right is facing left with its tail to the right.
2. **Analyze each option:**
   - **Option A:** The kangaroo is facing right with its tail to the left. Turning this card in any way will not make it look like the target card.
   - **Option B:** The kangaroo is facing left with its tail to the right. Turning this card 180 degrees will make it look like the target card.
   - **Option C:** The kangaroo is facing left with its tail to the right but is upside down relative to the target card. Turning this card 180 degrees will make it look like the target card.
   - **Option D:** The kangaroo is facing right with its tail to the left. Turning this card in any way will not make it look like the target card.
   - **Option E:** The kangaroo is facing left with its tail to the right. Turning this card 180 degrees will make it look like the target card.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is the card that can be turned around to look the same as the target card.

**Reasoning:** Option B and Option E can both be turned 180 degrees to match the target card. However, since the question asks for a single kangaroo card that can be turned around, we can choose either B or E as the correct answer.

**Answer:** B).
