**Reasoning**:
1. The given subtraction problem is `#3 - 2# = 2.5`.
2. The `#` symbols represent the digits that are painted over and thus not visible.
3. The subtraction involves borrowing because the result is 2.5 (implying 25 in a two-digit context).
4. Let's denote the first two-digit number as `a#` and the second as `2#`.
5. Since the result is 25, the tens digit of the result (2) comes from borrowing 1 from the tens place of `a#`.
6. This means `a` must be 3 (since we start with 30 and subtract 1 to get 2 in the tens place).
7. The units digit of the result (5) comes from subtracting the painted-over digit from 10 (because of borrowing).
8. Therefore, the painted-over digit in the units place must be 5 (since 10 - 5 = 5).
9. The sum of the two painted digits is 3 (from the tens place) + 5 (from the units place) = 8.

**Answer**: A).
