To analyze question 25, let's consider the points of intersection of the four lines and the parabola \( y = x^2 - 2 \).

1. **Identify the lines passing through the origin**:
   The lines passing through the origin have the form \( y = mx \), where \( m \) is the slope.

2. **Find the points of intersection**:
   For each line \( y = mx \), substitute \( y \) in the equation of the parabola \( y = x^2 - 2 \):
   \[
   mx = x^2 - 2
   \]
   \[
   x^2 - mx - 2 = 0
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   This is a quadratic equation in \( x \):
   \[
   x^2 - mx - 2 = 0
   \]
   Using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
   \[
   x = \frac{m \pm \sqrt{m^2 + 8}}{2}
   \]
   This gives two points of intersection for each line \( y = mx \):
   \[
   (x_1, y_1) = \left( \frac{m + \sqrt{m^2 + 8}}{2}, m \left( \frac{m + \sqrt{m^2 + 8}}{2} \right) \right)
   \]
   \[
   (x_2, y_2) = \left( \frac{m - \sqrt{m^2 + 8}}{2}, m \left( \frac{m - \sqrt{m^2 + 8}}{2} \right) \right)
   \]

4. **Calculate the product of the x-coordinates of the intersection points**:
   The product of the x-coordinates of the intersection points for one line is:
   \[
   x_1 \cdot x_2 = \left( \frac{m + \sqrt{m^2 + 8}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{m - \sqrt{m^2 + 8}}{2} \right)
   \]
   \[
   x_1 \cdot x_2 = \frac{m^2 - (m^2 + 8)}{4} = \frac{-8}{4} = -2
   \]

5. **Product for four lines**:
   Since we have four lines, each with an x-coordinate product of \(-2\), the overall product of the x-coordinates of the eight points is:
   \[
   (-2) \cdot (-2) \cdot (-2) \cdot (-2) = 16
   \]

**Reasoning**:
The product of the x-coordinates of the eight points of intersection of the four lines with the parabola is 16.

**Answer**: A).
