To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information and the plate of cookies:

1. We know that each participant baked one tray of cookies, and the plate needs to be filled with these cookies.
2. Count the number of different types of cookies on the plate.
3. Compare the total number of cookies on the plate to the number of cookies in one tray.

Let's break it down:

- The plate of cookies has the following cookies: 
  - 4 star-shaped cookies
  - 3 moon-shaped cookies
  - 2 circular cookies
  - 2 triangular cookies
  - 2 heart-shaped cookies

This sums up to a total of 13 cookies on the plate.

Each tray has 12 cookies as shown beside the plate. To get 13 cookies, we need at least 2 trays because one tray has only 12 cookies. Therefore, 2 trays are necessary to cover the 13 cookies on the plate.

Reasoning: The plate has 13 cookies, and each tray holds 12 cookies. To get 13 cookies, you need 2 trays to be sure you have enough cookies to cover all the types on the plate.

Answer: B)
