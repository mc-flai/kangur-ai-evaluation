To analyze question 28, we need to determine the number of integers between \( \sqrt{N^2 + N + 1} \) and \( \sqrt{9N^2 + N + 1} \).

### Reasoning:
1. **Determine the bounds**:
   \[
   \sqrt{N^2 + N + 1}
   \]
   Since \( N \) is a positive integer, \( N^2 + N + 1 \) is slightly greater than \( N^2 \), so \( \sqrt{N^2 + N + 1} \) is just above \( N \).

   \[
   \sqrt{9N^2 + N + 1}
   \]
   Similarly, \( 9N^2 + N + 1 \) is slightly greater than \( 9N^2 \), so \( \sqrt{9N^2 + N + 1} \) is just above \( 3N \).

2. **Identify the inclusive range**:
   The integers between \( \sqrt{N^2 + N + 1} \) and \( \sqrt{9N^2 + N + 1} \) are from \( N+1 \) to \( 3N \).

3. **Count the integers**:
   The integers in the range \( N+1 \) to \( 3N \) inclusive are:
   \[
   3N - (N+1) + 1 = 3N - N = 2N
   \]

### Answer:
C).
