**Reasoning**: There are 3 girls and 2 boys dancing in pairs. Each girl dances with each boy for exactly 1 minute. To find out the total number of minutes they danced, we need to calculate the total number of unique girl-boy pairs:

- Each of the 3 girls dances with each of the 2 boys.
- Therefore, the total number of unique pairs is 3 (girls) * 2 (boys) = 6 pairs.
- Since each pair dances for exactly 1 minute, the total time spent dancing is 6 minutes.
