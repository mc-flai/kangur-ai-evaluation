**Reasoning**:
1. The front view of the paper strips shows three horizontal strips: one gray, one white, and one black. The vertical strips consist of two black strips and one white strip in the center.
2. To determine the back view, we need to consider the arrangement of the vertical and horizontal strips.
3. The gray horizontal strip will be visible at the back, since the white and black horizontal strips are in front.
4. The back view will show the gray strip at the top, the white strip in the middle, and the black strip at the bottom.
5. Additionally, the vertical strips will show black on the left and right, with white in the center.
6. Examining the options, only option (B) matches this description.

**Answer**: B)
