To determine which adhesive is on the opposite side of the duck, we can analyze the provided figures and positions of the stickers.

1. **Identify the position of the duck**:
   - The duck is located on the front face of the cube in the first image and on the right face of the cube in the second image.

2. **Determine the opposite face**:
   - The opposite face of the front face (from the first image) is the back face.
   - The opposite face of the right face (from the second image) is the left face.

3. **Identify the sticker on the opposite face**:
   - From the first image, the sticker on the back face is the beetle (C).
   - From the second image, the sticker on the left face is the elephant (A).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the duck is on the front face in the first image and the elephant is opposite to it (on the back face), the elephant (A) is on the opposite side of the duck.

   Reasoning: The duck is on the front face in the first image, and the sticker on the back face (opposite to the front face) is the elephant.
