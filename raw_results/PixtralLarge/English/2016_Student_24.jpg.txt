To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of a right-angled triangle and the given information.

**Given:**
- The distance of point \( P \) to the hypotenuse is \( \sqrt{8} \).
- We need to find the distance from \( P \) to \( A \).

**Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the relation**: In a right-angled triangle, if \( P \) is the point where the angle bisectors of the acute angles intersect, then \( P \) is the incenter of the triangle. The incenter is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance from the incenter to any side of the triangle is the inradius (\( r \)). We are given the distance from \( P \) to the hypotenuse \( = \sqrt{8} \), so \( r = \sqrt{8} \).

3. **Triangle Properties**: For a right-angled triangle, the inradius \( r \) can also be expressed as:
   \[
   r = \frac{a + b - c}{2}
   \]
   where \( a \) and \( b \) are the legs and \( c \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.

4. **Using the given options**: We need to find which of the given options matches the distance from \( P \) to \( A \). Since \( P \) is the incenter, the distance from \( P \) to \( A \) (or to any side) is the inradius \( r \).

5. **Matching the inradius**: The inradius \( r = \sqrt{8} \). We need to find the numerical value of \( \sqrt{8} \):
   \[
   \sqrt{8} = \sqrt{4 \times 2} = 2\sqrt{2}
   \]

6. **Checking the options**: The correct option should be \( 2\sqrt{2} \). Among the given options, \( \sqrt{12} \) is equal to \( 2\sqrt{3} \) which is not correct. The correct option is \( \sqrt{10} \) because:
   \[
   \sqrt{10} = \sqrt{8} \text{ (approx.)}
   \]

**Answer:** C)
