To determine how many different positive whole numbers can be formed using exactly 6 matchsticks, we need to analyze the number of matchsticks required to form each digit from 0 to 9 as shown in the diagram.

1. **Digit Analysis**:
   - 0: 6 matchsticks
   - 1: 2 matchsticks
   - 2: 5 matchsticks
   - 3: 5 matchsticks
   - 4: 4 matchsticks
   - 5: 5 matchsticks
   - 6: 6 matchsticks
   - 7: 3 matchsticks
   - 8: 7 matchsticks
   - 9: 6 matchsticks

2. **Identify Numbers with 6 Matchsticks**:
   - From the diagram, the digits that can be formed using exactly 6 matchsticks are 0, 6, and 9.

3. **Count the Possible Numbers**:
   - There are no other digits that can be formed using exactly 6 matchsticks.
   - Therefore, the digits 0, 6, and 9 are the only potential candidates, but 0 is not a positive whole number.
   - The positive whole numbers that can be formed are 6 and 9.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - There are 2 different positive whole numbers that can be formed using exactly 6 matchsticks.

Reasoning: The digits 0, 6, and 9 each use exactly 6 matchsticks, but only 6 and 9 are positive whole numbers.
