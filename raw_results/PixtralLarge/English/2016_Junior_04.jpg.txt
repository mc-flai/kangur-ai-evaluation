To determine which point does not belong as a vertex of a square in a Cartesian coordinate system, we need to check the distances between the points. The vertices of a square must have equal distances between adjacent vertices and equal distances between diagonal vertices.

Given points:
- P(-1, 3)
- Q(0, -4)
- R(-2, -1)
- S(1, 1)
- T(3, -2)

We first calculate the distances between each pair of points to identify which points form a square.

1. Calculate the distance between P and Q:
   \[
   \sqrt{(-1 - 0)^2 + (3 - (-4))^2} = \sqrt{1 + 49} = \sqrt{50}
   \]

2. Calculate the distance between P and R:
   \[
   \sqrt{(-1 - (-2))^2 + (3 - (-1))^2} = \sqrt{1 + 16} = \sqrt{17}
   \]

3. Calculate the distance between P and S:
   \[
   \sqrt{(-1 - 1)^2 + (3 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 4} = \sqrt{8}
   \]

4. Calculate the distance between P and T:
   \[
   \sqrt{(-1 - 3)^2 + (3 - (-2))^2} = \sqrt{16 + 25} = \sqrt{41}
   \]

5. Calculate the distance between Q and R:
   \[
   \sqrt{(0 - (-2))^2 + (-4 - (-1))^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9} = \sqrt{13}
   \]

6. Calculate the distance between Q and S:
   \[
   \sqrt{(0 - 1)^2 + (-4 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 25} = \sqrt{26}
   \]

7. Calculate the distance between Q and T:
   \[
   \sqrt{(0 - 3)^2 + (-4 - (-2))^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4} = \sqrt{13}
   \]

8. Calculate the distance between R and S:
   \[
   \sqrt{(-2 - 1)^2 + (-1 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4} = \sqrt{13}
   \]

9. Calculate the distance between R and T:
   \[
   \sqrt{(-2 - 3)^2 + (-1 - (-2))^2} = \sqrt{25 + 1} = \sqrt{26}
   \]

10. Calculate the distance between S and T:
    \[
    \sqrt{(1 - 3)^2 + (1 - (-2))^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9} = \sqrt{13}
    \]

From these calculations, we can see that the distances between points P, Q, R, and S are consistent with the properties of a square (equal side lengths and equal diagonal lengths). Point T does not fit this pattern.

Reasoning: The distances between points P, Q, R, and S are consistent with the properties of a square, while point T does not fit this pattern.
