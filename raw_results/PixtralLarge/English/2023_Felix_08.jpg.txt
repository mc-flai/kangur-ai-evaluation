To determine the number of drops of glue needed, we need to understand how the cubes are connected in the figure.

1. Observe the figure and count the number of joints (connections) between the cubes. Each joint requires one drop of glue.
2. The figure consists of 12 cubes. Let's count the connections:
   - There are 4 cubes forming a vertical stack on the left, connected by 3 drops of glue.
   - There are 4 cubes forming a vertical stack on the right, connected by 3 drops of glue.
   - There are 4 cubes forming a horizontal stack at the bottom, connected by 3 drops of glue.
   - The bottom layer of cubes is connected to the vertical stacks by 2 drops of glue (one for each vertical stack).
3. Summing up all the drops of glue:
   - 3 (left vertical stack) + 3 (right vertical stack) + 3 (horizontal stack) + 2 (connections to vertical stacks) = 11 drops of glue.

Reasoning: By carefully counting the connections between cubes in the figure, we find that Hansi needs 11 drops of glue.

Answer: D).
