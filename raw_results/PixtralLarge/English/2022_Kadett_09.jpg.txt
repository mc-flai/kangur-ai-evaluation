To determine which diagram could show the rolled-up caterpillar, we need to consider how the caterpillar, made up of black and white segments, would look when rolled up into a ball.

1. Observing the original caterpillar, it alternates between black and white segments.
2. When rolled up, this alternating pattern should still be visible, but in a circular or spiral manner.

Let's analyze each option:
- (A) This option shows an alternating pattern that matches the original caterpillar but in a rolled-up form.
- (B) This option has the segments arranged in a way that doesn't match the alternating pattern of the original caterpillar.
- (C) This option also appears to have a mismatched pattern.
- (D) This option doesn't show the correct alternating black and white segments.
- (E) This option doesn't match the original caterpillar's alternating pattern.

Based on the above analysis, the correct diagram that shows the rolled-up caterpillar is (A).

Reasoning: The rolled-up caterpillar should maintain the alternating black and white pattern seen in the original caterpillar. Option (A) is the only one that preserves this pattern in a rolled-up form.
Answer: A).
