To determine the largest common divisor of \(2^{2021} + 2^{2022}\) and \(3^{2021} + 3^{2022}\), let's analyze the expressions.

First, factor out the common terms:
\[ 2^{2021} + 2^{2022} = 2^{2021}(1 + 2) = 2^{2021} \cdot 3 \]
\[ 3^{2021} + 3^{2022} = 3^{2021}(1 + 3) = 3^{2021} \cdot 4 \]

Next, observe that \(2^{2021}\) and \(3^{2021}\) are powers of 2 and 3, respectively, and thus they are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1).

Since \(2^{2021} \cdot 3\) and \(3^{2021} \cdot 4\) have no common factors other than 1, the largest common divisor of the sums is 1.

Reasoning: The largest common divisor of \(2^{2021} + 2^{2022}\) and \(3^{2021} + 3^{2022}\) is 1 because the factored forms are coprime.

Answer: B).
