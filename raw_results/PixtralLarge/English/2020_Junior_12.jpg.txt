**Reasoning**:
The given equality is \(2ab = 3cd\). To find the value of the product \(abcd\), we can express \(abcd\) in terms of \(2ab\) and \(3cd\):

\[
abcd = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2ab \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot 3cd = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3cd \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot 2ab = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 2ab \cdot 3cd
\]

Given \(2ab = 3cd\), substitute \(3cd\) for \(2ab\):

\[
abcd = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 3cd \cdot 3cd = \frac{1}{6} \cdot (3cd)^2
\]

Since \(2ab = 3cd\), we can let \(2ab = x\) and \(3cd = x\), then:

\[
abcd = \frac{1}{6} \cdot x^2
\]

We can test specific values to find \(x\). For simplicity, let \(x = 6\) (this satisfies \(2ab = 3cd\)):

\[
abcd = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 6^2 = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 36 = 6
\]

The product \(abcd\) will always be \( \frac{1}{6} \cdot (2ab)^2\). To find the correct answer, we need to evaluate which of the options will satisfy this condition.

For \(2ab = 3cd = 6\), the product \(abcd\) is 6, but we need to find the correct choice from the given options.

Given the options:
(A) 50
(B) 100
(C) 150
(D) 200
(E) 250

We can see that only option (C) 150 can be expressed as \(\frac{1}{6} \cdot 3cd \cdot 3cd\) if \(3cd = 60\).

**Answer**: C)
