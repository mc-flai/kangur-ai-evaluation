**Reasoning**: To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance the second runner covers between two consecutive meetings with the first runner. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Determine the speed of each runner. The first runner takes 4 minutes to complete one lap of 720 meters, so their speed is:
   \[
   \text{Speed of the first runner} = \frac{720 \text{ meters}}{4 \text{ minutes}} = 180 \text{ meters per minute}
   \]
   Similarly, the second runner takes 5 minutes to complete one lap, so their speed is:
   \[
   \text{Speed of the second runner} = \frac{720 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 144 \text{ meters per minute}
   \]

2. Calculate the combined speed of the two runners when they run towards each other. Since they are running in opposite directions, their combined speed is:
   \[
   \text{Combined speed} = 180 \text{ meters per minute} + 144 \text{ meters per minute} = 324 \text{ meters per minute}
   \]

3. Determine how far the second runner travels before meeting the first runner. The distance between two consecutive meetings is the total length of the track, which is 720 meters. However, since they are moving towards each other, we need to find the distance the second runner covers in the time it takes for them to meet.

4. Calculate the time it takes for them to meet. Using the combined speed:
   \[
   \text{Time to meet} = \frac{720 \text{ meters}}{324 \text{ meters per minute}}
   \]
   Simplifying the fraction:
   \[
   \text{Time to meet} = \frac{720}{324} = \frac{40}{18} = \frac{20}{9} \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. Calculate the distance the second runner travels in this time:
   \[
   \text{Distance covered by the second runner} = \text{Speed of the second runner} \times \text{Time to meet}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance covered by the second runner} = 144 \text{ meters per minute} \times \frac{20}{9} \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Simplifying the multiplication:
   \[
   \text{Distance covered by the second runner} = 144 \times \frac{20}{9} = 16 \times 20 = 320 \text{ meters}
   \]

Therefore, the second runner covers 320 meters between two consecutive meetings with the first runner.
