The problem asks for the number that appears in the colored triangle in the crown made up of 10 copies of a specific piece. Each piece is a triangle with numbers on its sides. The sides in contact have the same number.

To determine the number in the colored triangle, observe the pattern and positions of the numbers in the pieces. 

1. **Identify the numbers on the outer pieces**: Based on the image, the numbers visible on the outer pieces are 1, 3, 4, and 5.
2. **Determine the number on the colored triangle**: The colored triangle is connected to the pieces showing 4 and 5. These two pieces are part of a larger pattern and share the same number at the connection points.
3. **Check the consistency**: Given that the sides in contact have the same number, the number within the colored triangle should be consistent with this pattern.

Therefore, the number that logically fits in the colored triangle, given the pattern and the numbers on the visible pieces, is 5.

Reasoning: The number in the colored triangle is consistent with the pattern of numbers on the visible pieces, specifically the pieces showing 4 and 5, indicating the number in the colored triangle should be 5.
