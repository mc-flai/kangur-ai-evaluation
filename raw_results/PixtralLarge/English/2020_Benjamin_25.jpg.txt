To determine the correct answer for question 25, we need to consider the constraints given:

1. The group orders a total of 10 ice creams, with specific counts of each flavor:
   - Four vanilla
   - Three chocolate
   - Two lemon
   - One mango

2. They also order specific toppings:
   - Four umbrellas
   - Three cherries
   - Two wafers
   - One chocolate gum

3. Each ice cream must have one topping.
4. No two ice creams can have the same combination of flavor and topping.

Let's analyze each option to see which combination is possible without any repetitions:

- (A) Chocolate and chocolate gum: There are three chocolate ice creams and only one chocolate gum. This means two chocolate ice creams will be left without a unique topping.
- (B) Mango and cherry: There is only one mango ice cream and three cherries. This means two cherries will be left without a unique topping.
- (C) Lemon and wafer: There are two lemon ice creams and two wafers. This combination is possible because each lemon ice cream can have a wafer.
- (D) Mango and wafer: There is only one mango ice cream and two wafers. This means one wafer will be left without a unique topping.
- (E) Lemon and cherry: There are two lemon ice creams and three cherries. This means one cherry will be left without a unique topping.

Based on this analysis, the only combination where no topping is repeated for the same flavor is (C) Lemon and wafer.

Reasoning: The combination "Lemon and wafer" is possible because there are two lemon ice creams and two wafers, ensuring no repetition of toppings for the same flavor.
Answer: C)
