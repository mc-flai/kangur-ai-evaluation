**Reasoning**: The original order of the cards is 2-0-1-7. We need to determine which order cannot be obtained by swapping only two cards from this original order.

- **Option A (2-7-1-0)**: Swap 0 and 7. This order can be obtained.
- **Option B (0-1-2-7)**: Swap 2 and 0. This order can be obtained.
- **Option C (1-0-2-7)**: Swap 2 and 1. This order can be obtained.
- **Option D (0-2-1-7)**: To achieve this order, we would need to swap 2 and 0, then swap 1 and 7, which involves more than two swaps. Therefore, this order cannot be obtained by swapping only two cards.
- **Option E (2-0-7-1)**: Swap 1 and 7. This order can be obtained.

**Answer**: D
