To determine the correct order in which Anna uses the two machines, we need to carefully analyze the processes of each machine and the desired final outcome.

1. **Understand the machines**:
   - Machine R rotates a piece of paper 90째 clockwise.
   - Machine S prints a marking on the paper.

2. **Desired final picture**:
   - We need the marking to be in the center of the paper, with the marking oriented correctly.

3. **Analyze the options**:
   - (A) SRRR: Print the marking first, then rotate three times.
   - (B) RSRR: Rotate once, print, then rotate twice.
   - (C) SRSR: Print, rotate, print again, then rotate.
   - (D) RRRS: Rotate three times, then print.
   - (E) SRRS: Print, rotate twice, then print again.

4. **Determine correct sequence**:
   - To get the final desired picture, we need to end with a print (S) after a rotation (R).
   - Option (D) RRRS fits this criteria: Rotate three times (90째 each) for a total of 270째, then print.

Reasoning: The correct sequence must end with a print after rotations to achieve the marking in the center. Rotating three times (270째) and then printing will produce the desired result.

Answer: D).
