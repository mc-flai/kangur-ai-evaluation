To determine which piece fits in the middle of the diagram, we need to observe the connections of the lines in the surrounding pieces:

1. **Identify the line types and their connections**:
   - Light-grey lines must connect with light-grey lines.
   - Dark-grey lines must connect with dark-grey lines.
   - Black lines must connect with black lines.

2. **Examine the surrounding pieces**:
   - The top surrounding pieces have the following connections:
     - Top-left: Light-grey on the right side.
     - Top-right: Black on the left side.
   - The bottom surrounding pieces have the following connections:
     - Bottom-left: Black on the right side.
     - Bottom-right: Dark-grey on the left side.
   - The left surrounding piece has:
     - Dark-grey on the bottom-right side.
   - The right surrounding piece has:
     - Light-grey on the bottom-left side.

3. **Match the line types**:
   - The piece that fits must connect the light-grey, dark-grey, and black lines appropriately.
   - Check each option:
     - (A): Has a light-grey line at the top-right, a dark-grey line at the bottom-right, and a black line at the bottom-left.
     - (B): Has a light-grey line at the top-right, a black line at the bottom-right, and a dark-grey line at the bottom-left.
     - (C): Has a light-grey line at the top-right, a black line at the bottom-right, and a dark-grey line at the bottom-left.
     - (D): Has a light-grey line at the top-right, a black line at the bottom-right, and a dark-grey line at the bottom-left.
     - (E): Has a light-grey line at the top-right, a black line at the bottom-right, and a dark-grey line at the bottom-left.

4. **Evaluate the options**:
   - Option (A) matches the required connections:
     - Light-grey line connects with the top-left and right surrounding pieces.
     - Dark-grey line connects with the bottom-right surrounding piece.
     - Black line connects with the top-right and bottom-left surrounding pieces.

Reasoning: The piece that fits in the middle must have light-grey lines connecting to light-grey lines, dark-grey lines connecting to dark-grey lines, and black lines connecting to black lines. Option (A) is the only piece that satisfies these connections.

Answer: A).
