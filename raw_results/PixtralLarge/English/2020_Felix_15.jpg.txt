**Reasoning**: To solve question 15, we need to visualize the kangaroo on the card after it is turned around on the right side. The kangaroo is initially facing left as shown in the image. When a card is rotated around its vertical axis (right side), the image on the card will flip horizontally, making the kangaroo face the opposite direction. Additionally, the kangaroo's limbs will also appear on the opposite side.

Given the original image of the kangaroo with its legs on the right side and facing left, turning the card around the right side will result in the kangaroo's legs being on the left side and it facing right. Observing the options given:
- (A) The kangaroo is facing left.
- (B) The kangaroo is facing left and upside down.
- (C) The kangaroo is facing right.
- (D) The kangaroo is facing right.
- (E) The kangaroo is facing left.

Options (C) and (D) have the kangaroo facing right, but option (C) shows the tail on the wrong side, which does not match the expected flipped image. Therefore, option (D) is the correct one as it shows the kangaroo facing right with its legs on the left side.

**Answer**: D).
