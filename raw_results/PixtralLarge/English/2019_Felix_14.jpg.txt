To determine which figure needs the least amount of color, we need to examine how many faces of the cubes are visible and would require coloring.

Let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: This figure has 4 cubes arranged in a row. The visible faces include the front, top, and right sides of each cube. Therefore, there are 12 visible faces in total (3 faces per cube × 4 cubes).

- **Option B**: This figure has 4 cubes stacked in a 2x2 grid. The visible faces include the front and top sides of each cube. Therefore, there are 8 visible faces in total (2 faces per cube × 4 cubes).

- **Option C**: This figure has 4 cubes arranged in an L-shape. The visible faces include the front, top, and right sides of the cubes. There are 11 visible faces in total (3 faces for 3 cubes and 2 faces for 1 cube).

- **Option D**: This figure has 4 cubes stacked in a staggered manner. The visible faces include the front, top, and right sides of the cubes. There are 10 visible faces in total (3 faces for 2 cubes and 2 faces for 2 cubes).

- **Option E**: This figure has 4 cubes stacked in a T-shape. The visible faces include the front, top, and right sides of the cubes. There are 11 visible faces in total (3 faces for 3 cubes and 2 faces for 1 cube).

From the analysis, Option B has the least number of visible faces (8 faces) that need to be colored.

**Reasoning**: Option B has the least number of visible faces (8 faces) and thus requires the least amount of color.
**Answer**: B)
