To determine which of the given passwords could be Paulâ€™s, we need to consider the provided clues:

1. The three last characters are digits.
2. There are at most three capital letters in the password.

Let's analyze each option:

- (A) PAUL123
  - Last three characters: 123 (digits)
  - Capital letters: PAUL (4 capital letters)
  - This does not satisfy the condition of having at most three capital letters.

- (B) P0a1u2L3
  - Last three characters: L3 (not all digits)
  - This does not satisfy the condition that the last three characters are digits.

- (C) 1234LLuuapp4321
  - Last three characters: 321 (digits)
  - Capital letters: LL (2 capital letters)
  - This satisfies both conditions.

- (D) Paulin3
  - Last three characters: in3 (not all digits)
  - This does not satisfy the condition that the last three characters are digits.

- (E) 123PAUL
  - Last three characters: AUL (not all digits)
  - This does not satisfy the condition that the last three characters are digits.

Based on the analysis, only option (C) satisfies both conditions.

Reasoning: The password must have its last three characters as digits and contain at most three capital letters. Option (C) meets both criteria.
Answer: C)
