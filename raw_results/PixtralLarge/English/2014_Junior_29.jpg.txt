**Reasoning**:
1. We need to consider all 7-digit numbers using the digits from 1 to 7.
2. Write these numbers in increasing order.
3. Split the list exactly in the middle to create two lists of equal size.
4. Identify the last number of the first list.

To find the last number of the first list:
- The smallest 7-digit number using the digits 1 to 7 is 1234567.
- The largest 7-digit number using the digits 1 to 7 is 7654321.
- The total number of 7-digit permutations of these digits is 7! (which is 5040).
- Dividing 5040 by 2 gives us 2520, meaning the first half of the list contains the first 2520 numbers.
- The 2520th number in the ordered list is 4123567 (as calculated by permutation ordering).

**Answer**: C).
