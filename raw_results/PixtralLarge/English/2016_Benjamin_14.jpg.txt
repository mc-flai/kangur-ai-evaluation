**Reasoning**:
- Hansi writes the number 2581953764 on a strip of paper.
- He cuts through the strip of paper between two digits and obtains three numbers which he adds.
- To minimize the sum, we should aim to create the smallest possible numbers by cutting strategically.

  To find the smallest sum, consider where to place the cuts:
  - By observing the digits, we need to avoid splitting in a way that creates large numbers.
  - A potential smallest split could be:
    - 2, 5819537, 64
    - Sum = 2 + 5819537 + 64 = 5819603

  Another potential split:
    - 258, 1953, 764
    - Sum = 258 + 1953 + 764 = 2975

  Compare this with other possible splits, but it is evident that splitting to minimize the digits combined will yield a lower sum.

  Therefore, the smallest feasible sum is 2975.

**Answer**: B)
