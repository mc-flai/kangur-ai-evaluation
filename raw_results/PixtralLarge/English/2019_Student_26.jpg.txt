**Reasoning**: To determine how many integers \( n \) make \( |n^2 - 2n - 3| \) a prime number, we need to analyze the expression \( n^2 - 2n - 3 \).

First, let's factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ n^2 - 2n - 3 = (n - 3)(n + 1) \]

For \( |n^2 - 2n - 3| \) to be a prime number, the absolute value of the product of these two factors must be a prime number. This can happen in two cases:
1. The product is positive and equals a prime number.
2. The product is negative, making the absolute value a prime number.

Let's consider both cases:

**Case 1**: \( (n - 3)(n + 1) \) is positive and equals a prime number.
- Since a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors (1 and itself), one of the factors \( (n - 3) \) or \( (n + 1) \) must be 1.
- If \( n - 3 = 1 \), then \( n = 4 \). Checking, we get \( (4 - 3)(4 + 1) = 1 \times 5 = 5 \), which is prime.
- If \( n + 1 = 1 \), then \( n = 0 \). Checking, we get \( (0 - 3)(0 + 1) = -3 \times 1 = -3 \), which is not prime.

**Case 2**: \( (n - 3)(n + 1) \) is negative, making the absolute value a prime number.
- For the product to be negative, one factor must be positive and the other negative.
- The factors \( n - 3 \) and \( n + 1 \) change sign at \( n = 3 \) and \( n = -1 \), respectively.
- We need to check integers between -1 and 3.
- For \( n = -2 \), we get \( (-2 - 3)(-2 + 1) = -5 \times -1 = 5 \), which is prime.
- For \( n = 2 \), we get \( (2 - 3)(2 + 1) = -1 \times 3 = -3 \), which is not prime.

Thus, the integers \( n \) that make \( |n^2 - 2n - 3| \) a prime number are \( n = 4 \) and \( n = -2 \). Therefore, there are 2 such integers.
