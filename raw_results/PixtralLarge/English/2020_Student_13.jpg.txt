**Reasoning**:
1. Zilda will use six equal cubes and two different rectangular blocks to form the structure shown in the image.
2. The entire structure has eight faces in total, and she plans to paint all of these faces.
3. When the parts are assembled, some of the faces will be hidden internally and won't require painting.
4. Initially, Zilda calculates that she will need 18 liters of paint to cover all the faces of the individual pieces before assembly.
5. After assembly, the faces that are hidden (interior faces) will not need paint, so the total amount of paint required will be less than 18 liters.
6. The correct answer will be less than 18 liters.
7. Among the options given, the closest value less than 18 liters is 11.5 liters.

**Answer**: C).
