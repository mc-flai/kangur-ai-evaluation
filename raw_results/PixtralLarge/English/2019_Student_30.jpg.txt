To determine which number should be placed in the top right cell of the grid, we need to ensure that each number from 1 to 5 appears exactly once in each row and each column. Additionally, the sum of all numbers in the three black-bordered sections should be the same.

First, let's analyze the current state of the grid:
- The number 2 is already placed in the bottom left cell.
- The black-bordered sections need to have the same sum.

Let's consider the rows and columns:
- Since the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 must appear exactly once in each row and column, we can start by placing the number 2 in the bottom left cell.
- We need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in the three black-bordered sections is the same.

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the black-bordered sections:
- The bottom left section contains the number 2.
- The middle section and the top right section must have numbers that, when added to 2, result in the same sum.

Since the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 must be used, and each number appears exactly once in each row and column, we can deduce the following:
- The sum of the numbers in each black-bordered section should be 9 (since 1+2+3+4+5 = 15, and we need three sections with equal sums, 15/3 = 5).

Now, let's place the numbers in the grid:
- The bottom left cell has the number 2.
- The middle section must contain numbers that add up to 9.
- The top right section must also contain numbers that add up to 9.

Given the constraints, the number that fits in the top right cell to satisfy all conditions is 3.

Reasoning: The number 3 ensures that each number from 1 to 5 appears exactly once in each row and column, and the sum of the numbers in the black-bordered sections is the same.
