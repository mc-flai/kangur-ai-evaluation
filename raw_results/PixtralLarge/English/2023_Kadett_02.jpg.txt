To determine which shape cannot be cut into two trapeziums with a single straight line, we need to understand the defining characteristic of a trapezium (or trapezoid): it has at least one pair of parallel sides.

- **A (Triangle)**: A triangle can be cut into two trapeziums by drawing a line parallel to one of its sides.

- **B (Rectangle)**: A rectangle can be cut into two trapeziums by drawing a line parallel to one pair of sides.

- **C (Trapezium)**: A trapezium can obviously be cut into two trapeziums by drawing a line parallel to its pair of non-parallel sides.

- **D (Regular Hexagon)**: A regular hexagon can be cut into two trapeziums by drawing a line parallel to one pair of its opposite sides.

- **E (Square)**: A square can be cut into two trapeziums by drawing a line parallel to one of its sides.

A regular hexagon (D) is a special case because it has six equal sides and six equal angles. To cut it into two trapeziums with one straight line, you would need to draw a line parallel to one pair of its opposite sides. However, due to its symmetrical nature, this is not possible with one single straight line that would ensure each resulting shape has at least one pair of parallel sides.

Reasoning: Upon analyzing the shapes, the regular hexagon (D) cannot be cut into two trapeziums with a single straight line due to its symmetrical properties.

Answer: D).
