**Reasoning**: The image shows two rows, each with three boxes. The top row has one box with a plus sign, indicating that the sum of the digits in the boxes below it should be correct.

The digits provided are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Since each digit will only be used once, we need to determine which digit fits in the grey box to complete the correct sum.

To find the correct digit, we can use a process of elimination:

1. The sum of the digits in the top row is the sum of the digits in the bottom row plus the digit in the grey box.
2. The possible sums of the digits in the top row (using unique digits) are:
   - Using 0, 1, 2: Sum = 0 + 1 + 2 = 3
   - Using 0, 1, 3: Sum = 0 + 1 + 3 = 4
   - Using 0, 1, 4: Sum = 0 + 1 + 4 = 5
   - Using 0, 1, 5: Sum = 0 + 1 + 5 = 6
   - Using 0, 1, 6: Sum = 0 + 1 + 6 = 7
   - Using 0, 2, 3: Sum = 0 + 2 + 3 = 5
   - Using 0, 2, 4: Sum = 0 + 2 + 4 = 6
   - Using 0, 2, 5: Sum = 0 + 2 + 5 = 7
   - Using 0, 2, 6: Sum = 0 + 2 + 6 = 8
   - Using 0, 3, 4: Sum = 0 + 3 + 4 = 7
   - Using 0, 3, 5: Sum = 0 + 3 + 5 = 8
   - Using 0, 3, 6: Sum = 0 + 3 + 6 = 9
   - Using 0, 4, 5: Sum = 0 + 4 + 5 = 9
   - Using 0, 4, 6: Sum = 0 + 4 + 6 = 10
   - Using 0, 5, 6: Sum = 0 + 5 + 6 = 11
   - Using 1, 2, 3: Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
   - Using 1, 2, 4: Sum = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
   - Using 1, 2, 5: Sum = 1 + 2 + 5 = 8
   - Using 1, 2, 6: Sum = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9
   - Using 1, 3, 4: Sum = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8
   - Using 1, 3, 5: Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
   - Using 1, 3, 6: Sum = 1 + 3 + 6 = 10
   - Using 1, 4, 5: Sum = 1 + 4 + 5 = 10
   - Using 1, 4, 6: Sum = 1 + 4 + 6 = 11
   - Using 1, 5, 6: Sum = 1 + 5 + 6 = 12
   - Using 2, 3, 4: Sum = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9
   - Using 2, 3, 5: Sum = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10
   - Using 2, 3, 6: Sum = 2 + 3 + 6 = 11
   - Using 2, 4, 5: Sum = 2 + 4 + 5 = 11
   - Using 2, 4, 6: Sum = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12
   - Using 2, 5, 6: Sum = 2 + 5 + 6 = 13
   - Using 3, 4, 5: Sum = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12
   - Using 3, 4, 6: Sum = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13
   - Using 3, 5, 6: Sum = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
   - Using 4, 5, 6: Sum = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

Based on the given sums, we need to find the sum of three digits that, when added to the digit in the grey box, equals the sum of the digits in the top row.

Observing the digits 3, 5, and 6 in the bottom row, the sum is 3 + 5 + 6 = 14. The digit in the grey box must be such that when added to 14, it equals one of the possible sums listed above.

Checking the possible sums, we see that 14 + 2 = 16, which is not in the list. However, 14 + 3 = 17, which is also not in the list. Continuing this process, we find that 14 + 4 = 18, which is not in the list. Finally, 14 + 5 = 19, which is not in the list. However, 14 + 6 = 20, which is not in the list.

Since none of the sums match the possible sums listed above, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to find the digit that, when added to the sum of the digits in the bottom row, equals the sum of the digits in the top row.
