To solve question 23, we need to analyze the relationships between the individuals as represented by the arrows in the figure. Each arrow points from a shorter person to a taller person.

1. **Person E points to Person A** – This means Person E is shorter than Person A.
2. **Person D points to Person A** – This means Person D is shorter than Person A.
3. **Person C points to Person F** – This means Person C is shorter than Person F.
4. **Person B points to Person A** – This means Person B is shorter than Person A.
5. **Person B points to Person C** – This means Person B is shorter than Person C.
6. **Person E points to Person C** – This means Person E is shorter than Person C.

From these relationships, we can deduce the following:

- Person A is taller than Person B, Person D, and Person E.
- Person F is taller than Person C.
- Person C is taller than Person B and Person E.

Since no one points to Person A, this means Person A is not shorter than anyone, implying Person A is the tallest.

Reasoning: By following the arrows and understanding the relationships, we can determine that Person A is the tallest as no arrows point to Person A, indicating no one is taller than Person A.

Answer: A).
