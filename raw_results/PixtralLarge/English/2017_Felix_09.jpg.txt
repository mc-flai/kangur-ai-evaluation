**Reasoning**:
1. There are 11 people total in the queue.
2. Leo has 7 people in front of him, which means Leo is the 8th person in the queue.
3. Max stands directly behind Leo, so Max is the 9th person in the queue.
4. There are 11 total people, and Max is the 9th person, so we subtract 9 from 11 to find out how many people are behind Max.
5. 11 - 9 = 2 people are behind Max.

**Answer**: B).
