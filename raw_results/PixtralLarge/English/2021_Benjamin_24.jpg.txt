**Reasoning**: 
The problem gives us the following relations:

1. An apple and an orange weigh as much as a pear and a peach.
2. An apple and a pear weigh less than an orange and a peach.
3. A pear and an orange weigh less than an apple and a peach.

Let's denote the weights of the fruits as follows:
- Apple: A
- Orange: O
- Pear: P
- Peach: H

From the given relations:
1. A + O = P + H
2. A + P < O + H
3. P + O < A + H

We need to determine which fruit is the heaviest. To solve this, we can start by analyzing the inequalities.

From the first relation, we get:
A + O = P + H

From the second relation, we get:
A + P < O + H
Replacing A from the first relation, we get:
P + H - O + P < O + H
2P < O + H + O
2P < 2O + H
P < O + H

From the third relation, we get:
P + O < A + H
Replacing A from the first relation, we get:
P + O < P + H - O + H
O < H

We already know from the second relation:
A + P < O + H
Replacing O from the previous inequality, we get:
A + P < H + H
A + P < 2H
A < 2H - P

Since P < O + H and O < H, it suggests that the peach (H) is the fruit with the greatest weight.

**Answer**: C)

**Note**: The reasoning assumes that the weights of the fruits are distinct and the relations are consistent.
