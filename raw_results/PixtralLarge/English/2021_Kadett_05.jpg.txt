To solve this question, let's analyze the given pieces and how they fit together to form a rectangle with a calculation.

The puzzle pieces are: 2, 0, 2, 1, 5

When fitted together correctly, the sequence forms a rectangle containing a complete number.

Here is the arrangement of the pieces:

```
2 0 2
1 5
```

This forms the number 20215.

Now, we need to identify which of the options corresponds to 20215:

- (A) -100
- (B) -8
- (C) -1
- (D) 199
- (E) 208

None of the given options directly match 20215. Therefore, we need to check if there is a calculation that could potentially produce one of the options listed.

However, since there is no arithmetic operation or sequence that can transform 20215 into any of the given options, we can infer that the answer is likely a trick question and the correct choice is the option that seems most reasonable.

Considering the options:
- (A) -100
- (B) -8
- (C) -1
- (D) 199
- (E) 208

Option (E) 208 is the closest numerically to a part of the number formed (202).

Therefore, the most logical answer based on the given options is:

Reasoning: The number formed by the pieces is 20215, and the closest option numerically is 208.
Answer: E).
