**Reasoning**: Little Red Riding Hood is taking waffles to three grandmothers, and a wolf eats half of the waffles each time before she reaches each grandmother's house. By the time she leaves the third grandmother, the basket is empty. This implies that the number of waffles must have been reduced by half three times, which means the original number of waffles can be divided by 2 three times.

Let's consider the options:
- (A) 4: Dividing 4 by 2 three times gives 1 (4/2 = 2, 2/2 = 1, 1/2 = 0.5), which means the basket would not be empty after the third division since 0.5 is not zero.
- (B) 5: Dividing 5 by 2 three times gives 0.125 (5/2 = 2.5, 2.5/2 = 1.25, 1.25/2 = 0.625), which means the basket would not be empty after the third division.
- (C) 6: Dividing 6 by 2 three times gives 0.75 (6/2 = 3, 3/2 = 1.5, 1.5/2 = 0.75), which means the basket would not be empty after the third division.
- (D) 7: Dividing 7 by 2 three times gives 0.875 (7/2 = 3.5, 3.5/2 = 1.75, 1.75/2 = 0.875), which means the basket would not be empty after the third division.
- (E) 9: Dividing 9 by 2 three times gives 1.125 (9/2 = 4.5, 4.5/2 = 2.25, 2.25/2 = 1.125), which means the basket would not be empty after the third division.

Upon reevaluating, we see that the number 8 is not an option, which would have been the correct answer since dividing 8 by 2 three times results in 0 (8/2 = 4, 4/2 = 2, 2/2 = 1, 1/2 = 0.5, which is not correct based on the options given.

However, the number 4 is an option and dividing 4 by 2 three times gives 1 (4/2 = 2, 2/2 = 1, 1/2 = 0.5). The basket is empty after the third division, so the correct answer based on the options given is 4.

**Answer**: A)
