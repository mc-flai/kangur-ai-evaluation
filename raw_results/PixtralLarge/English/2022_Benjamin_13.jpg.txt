To determine the correct answer for question 13, we need to visualize how the square-shaped transparent piece of foil would look after being folded over twice.

1. **First Fold**:
   - Imagine the foil being folded along the first line indicated in the diagram. This would place the upper-right triangle over the bottom-left triangle.

2. **Second Fold**:
   - Next, imagine the foil being folded again along the second line indicated in the diagram. This fold would place the upper-left triangle over the bottom-right triangle.

3. **Final Appearance**:
   - After the second fold, the foil would have overlapping sections creating a pattern of triangles within the square. Specifically, the resulting pattern should include intersecting diagonal lines forming a grid with smaller triangular sections.

By examining the provided options (A, B, C, D, and E), we can identify which pattern matches the description of the foil after the two folds.

- Option (A) has four triangles with no smaller sections formed within.
- Option (B) has smaller triangular sections created by intersecting lines.
- Option (C) has diagonal lines intersecting to form four triangles.
- Option (D) has diagonal lines forming four triangular sections but not the same as the folds described.
- Option (E) has diagonal lines forming four triangles similar to option (C).

Reasoning through the folds, option (B) is the only one that matches the expected pattern with smaller triangular sections formed by intersecting lines.

Reasoning: The pattern formed by folding the foil twice creates intersecting diagonal lines that form smaller triangular sections within the square.
Answer: B).
