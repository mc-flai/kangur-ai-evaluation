To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of the digit \( d \) in the 12-digit number formed by the product of six consecutive numbers of the form \( abb \, cdd \, cdd \, abb \).

**Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Product Form:**
   The 12-digit number is formed by the product of six consecutive numbers. Let's denote these six consecutive numbers as \( n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, \) and \( n+5 \).

2. **Understand the Digit Structure:**
   The 12-digit number is structured as \( abb \, cdd \, cdd \, abb \). The digits \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are consecutive numbers in any order.

3. **Properties of Consecutive Numbers:**
   Since the numbers are consecutive, the product of these six numbers will include all the digits from \( n \) to \( n+5 \).

4. **Analyze the Pattern:**
   The pattern \( abb \, cdd \, cdd \, abb \) suggests that the digits \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) appear in a specific repetitive manner. The digit \( d \) appears 4 times in the sequence.

5. **Determine the Value of \( d \):**
   For the product of six consecutive numbers to form a 12-digit number with the given structure, the digit \( d \) must be the most frequent digit among the product of these six numbers. Since \( d \) appears 4 times, it is reasonable to infer that \( d \) is the middle digit of the six consecutive numbers. The middle digit of six consecutive numbers is the fourth number in the sequence.

6. **Calculate the Middle Digit:**
   The middle digit of six consecutive numbers \( n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5 \) is \( n+2 \). For simplicity, let's consider \( n = 1 \) (since the exact value of \( n \) does not affect the relative position of the middle digit). Thus, the middle digit is \( 1+2 = 3 \).

Therefore, the value of the digit \( d \) is 3.

**Answer:** C)
