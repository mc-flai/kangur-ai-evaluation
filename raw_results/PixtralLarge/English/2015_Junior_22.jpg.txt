To determine how many two-digit numbers can be written as the sum of exactly six different powers of two, we need to consider the following:

1. The powers of two are \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, \ldots\).
2. We need to find combinations of six different powers of two that sum to a two-digit number (i.e., 10 to 99).

Let's analyze the feasibility:

- The smallest six different powers of two are \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5\).
- Summing these, we get: \(2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 63\).

63 is a two-digit number. Now, let's consider the next smallest set of six different powers of two:

- Replace \(2^0\) with \(2^6\): \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6\).
- Summing these, we get: \(2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 126\).

126 is not a two-digit number. Any other combination of six different powers of two will either be less than or equal to 63 or greater than or equal to 126. Therefore, the only valid combination is the one that sums to 63.

Reasoning: The only set of six different powers of two that sums to a two-digit number is \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5\), which equals 63.
