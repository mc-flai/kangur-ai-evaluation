To determine the smallest sum Julian can get by adding three numbers obtained from cutting the number 5021972970 in half, we need to consider the possible combinations.

First, we split the number 5021972970 into three parts by cutting it twice. Possible cuts could be:
- 502, 197, 2970
- 5021, 972, 970
- 50, 2197, 2970
- 5021, 9729, 70
- etc.

We need to find the combination that yields the smallest sum.

By inspecting the various combinations, we observe that the smallest numbers are achieved by splitting the number as follows:
- 50, 2197, 2970

This gives us the numbers 50, 2197, and 2970.

Now, we calculate the sum:
50 + 2197 + 2970 = 4217

However, we notice that this is not the smallest possible sum. Let's try another combination:
- 5021, 972, 970

Summing these numbers:
5021 + 972 + 970 = 6963

Let's try another combination:
- 50, 2197, 2970

Summing these numbers:
50 + 2197 + 2970 = 5217

Another possible combination that gives a lower sum is:
- 502, 1972, 970

Summing these numbers:
502 + 1972 + 970 = 3444

This appears to be the smallest sum possible.

Reasoning: The smallest sum obtained by adding the three numbers from the given splits is 3444.
