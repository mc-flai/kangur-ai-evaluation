**Reasoning**: The image shows a figure composed of three squares, and the side length of the smallest square is given as 6 cm. The side length of each subsequent square increases by the side length of the previous square.

1. The smallest square has a side length of 6 cm.
2. The second square has a side length that is the sum of the side length of the smallest square and the 2 cm side length shown in the image: 6 cm + 2 cm = 8 cm.
3. The third (largest) square has a side length that is the sum of the side lengths of the first two squares: 6 cm + 8 cm = 14 cm.

**Answer**: D)
