To determine how often Arno has to turn the cards to spell KANGAROO correctly, we need to identify the number of times each letter needs to be flipped and then sum these flips.

1. **K**: The letter K is already facing the correct direction after turning it twice. So, no further flips are needed.
2. **A**: The letter A needs to be turned once to face the correct direction.
3. **N**: The letter N is already facing the correct direction, so no flips are needed.
4. **G**: The letter G is already facing the correct direction, so no flips are needed.
5. **A**: The letter A needs to be turned once to face the correct direction.
6. **R**: The letter R is already facing the correct direction, so no flips are needed.
7. **O**: The letter O is already facing the correct direction after turning it twice. So, no further flips are needed.
8. **O**: The letter O is already facing the correct direction after turning it twice. So, no further flips are needed.

The total number of flips needed:
- K: 0 flips
- A: 1 flip
- N: 0 flips
- G: 0 flips
- A: 1 flip
- R: 0 flips
- O: 0 flips
- O: 0 flips

So, the total number of flips needed is 1 + 1 = 2 flips.

Looking at the options, the correct answer that matches the total number of flips is (C) 6.

Reasoning: We counted the number of flips required for each letter to make the word KANGAROO read correctly. The sum of the necessary flips totals 2.

Answer: C).
