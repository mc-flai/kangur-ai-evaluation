To determine the correct answer for question 27, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understand the structure**:
   - The original structure is a 3 x 3 x 3 die (cube).
   - Seven little dice are removed from this larger cube.

2. **Visualize the remaining structure**:
   - Removing seven dice from the 3 x 3 x 3 die means that there are 27 - 7 = 20 dice remaining.
   - The problem specifies that the remaining figure is completely symmetrical.

3. **Determine the cross-section**:
   - The cross-section is made by a plane passing through the center of the figure and perpendicular to one of the four space diagonals.
   - A space diagonal is a line connecting opposite corners of the cube.

4. **Symmetry and shape**:
   - Given the symmetrical nature of the remaining figure and the cut through the center, the cross-section will be symmetrical and centered.
   - The cross-section should pass through the center of the cube and be perpendicular to a diagonal.

5. **Analyze the options**:
   - (A) shows a hexagon with internal lines.
   - (B) shows a regular hexagon.
   - (C) shows a hexagon with a smaller hexagon inside.
   - (D) shows a hexagon with a smaller square inside.
   - (E) shows a hexagon with a triangle inside.

6. **Choose the correct option**:
   - The cross-section of a cube cut through the center and perpendicular to a space diagonal typically yields a regular hexagon.
   - Option (B) correctly represents this scenario.

Reasoning: The symmetrical remaining figure, when cut through the center and perpendicular to a space diagonal, results in a regular hexagon. This fits option (B).

Answer: B).
