To solve this problem, we need to determine the largest square pattern Julia can form using the available discs. The pattern alternates colors in each row and column, starting with a black disc in the left upper corner.

1. Let's define the size of the square pattern as \( n \times n \).
2. The number of black discs needed for an \( n \times n \) pattern is given by:
\[ \left\lceil \frac{n^2}{2} \right\rceil \]
3. The number of white discs needed for an \( n \times n \) pattern is given by:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{2} \right\rfloor \]

Julia has 1009 black discs and 1008 white discs. We need to find the largest \( n \) such that:
\[ \left\lceil \frac{n^2}{2} \right\rceil \leq 1009 \]
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{2} \right\rfloor \leq 1008 \]

For \( n = 45 \):
\[ \left\lceil \frac{45^2}{2} \right\rceil = \left\lceil \frac{2025}{2} \right\rceil = 1013 \]
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{45^2}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2025}{2} \right\rfloor = 1012 \]

This exceeds the number of available discs.

For \( n = 44 \):
\[ \left\lceil \frac{44^2}{2} \right\rceil = \left\lceil \frac{1936}{2} \right\rceil = 968 \]
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{44^2}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{1936}{2} \right\rfloor = 968 \]

This is within the number of available discs.

So, the largest square pattern Julia can form is \( 44 \times 44 \).

Next, we need to determine how many discs are left over:
- Black discs used: 968
- White discs used: 968

Discs left over:
- Black: \( 1009 - 968 = 41 \)
- White: \( 1008 - 968 = 40 \)

Reasoning: The largest square pattern Julia can form is 44x44, which uses 968 black and 968 white discs. This leaves 41 black discs and 40 white discs.

Answer: E).
