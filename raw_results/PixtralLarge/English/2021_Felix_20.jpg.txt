**Reasoning**: To determine the correct answer, we need to visualize the rotation of the small cog and how it affects the position of the teeth relative to each other. The small cog has a black tooth that will move in the direction indicated by the arrow. When it makes one full turn:

1. The small cog will rotate 360 degrees.
2. The large cog has more teeth, so it will rotate less than 360 degrees in the opposite direction.
3. The black tooth on the small cog will push the large cog's teeth in the opposite direction.
4. Given the initial positions, after a full turn of the small cog, the black teeth will be positioned as in option (C).

**Answer**: C)
