**Reasoning**: 
- Initially, Luis has 7 apples and 2 bananas.
- Luis gives 2 apples to Jacob, so he has 7 - 2 = 5 apples left.
- Jacob gives Luis bananas in return.
- After the exchange, Luis has the same amount of apples as bananas.
- Since Luis has 5 apples, he must also have 5 bananas.
- Luis initially had 2 bananas, so he must have received 5 - 2 = 3 bananas from Jacob.

**Answer**: B)
