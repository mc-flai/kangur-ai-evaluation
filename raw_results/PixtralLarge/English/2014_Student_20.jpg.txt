To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the geometric shapes and the given conditions.

1. **Identify the key points and properties**:
   - \( PQRS \) is a rectangle.
   - \( T \) is the midpoint of \( RS \).
   - \( QT \) is normal (perpendicular) to the diagonal \( PR \).

2. **Understand the implications**:
   - Since \( T \) is the midpoint of \( RS \), \( RT = TS \).
   - Since \( QT \) is perpendicular to \( PR \), \( \triangle PQT \) is a right triangle with \( PQ \) as the base and \( QT \) as the height.

3. **Use the properties of the rectangle**:
   - In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other.
   - The diagonals of a rectangle form two congruent right triangles when they intersect.

4. **Analyze the right triangle \( \triangle PQT \)**:
   - Since \( QT \) is perpendicular to \( PR \), \( \triangle PQT \) is a right triangle.
   - The length \( PQ \) is a side of the rectangle, and \( QT \) is the height from \( Q \) to \( PR \).

5. **Determine the ratio of the lengths \( PQ : QR \)**:
   - In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so \( PQ = RS \).
   - Since \( T \) is the midpoint of \( RS \), \( RT = TS = \frac{RS}{2} \).
   - Given that \( QT \) is perpendicular to \( PR \), and \( PR \) is the diagonal of the rectangle, we can use the properties of the rectangle and the right triangle to find the ratio.

6. **Calculate the ratio**:
   - Since \( PQ = RS \) and \( QT \) is perpendicular to \( PR \), the ratio \( PQ : QR \) is determined by the properties of the rectangle and the right triangle.
   - The correct ratio is given by option (D) \( \sqrt{2} : 1 \).

Reasoning: The properties of the rectangle and the right triangle formed by the diagonal and the perpendicular line from \( Q \) to \( PR \) lead to the conclusion that the ratio of the lengths \( PQ : QR \) is \( \sqrt{2} : 1 \).

Answer: D).
