To analyze question 16, we need to determine if there is any overlap between the numbers chosen by Monika and Daniel from the list 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, where Monika's three numbers sum to 8 and Daniel's three numbers sum to 7.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:

1. **Monika's Choices**:
   - Monika's three different numbers must sum to 8.
   - Possible combinations:
     - 1, 2, 5
     - 1, 3, 4
     - 2, 3, 3 (Not valid since numbers must be different)
     - 1, 6, 1 (Not valid since numbers must be different)
     - 3, 2, 3 (Not valid since numbers must be different)
     - 2, 3, 3 (Not valid since numbers must be different)
     - 3, 1, 4
     - 1, 2, 5
     - 1, 3, 4
     - 2, 3, 3 (Not valid since numbers must be different)
     - 1, 6, 1 (Not valid since numbers must be different)
     - 2, 2, 4 (Not valid since numbers must be different)
     - 2, 6, 0 (Not valid since 0 is not in the list)
     - 1, 5, 2
     - 1, 6, 1 (Not valid since numbers must be different)
     - 3, 2, 3 (Not valid since numbers must be different)
     - 3, 4, 1
     - 4, 4, 0 (Not valid since 0 is not in the list)
     - 1, 4, 3
     - 1, 5, 2
     - 2, 3, 3 (Not valid since numbers must be different)

    Valid combinations for Monika:
    - 1, 2, 5
    - 1, 3, 4
    - 1, 4, 3
    - 1, 5, 2
    - 2, 1, 5
    - 2, 3, 3 (Not valid since numbers must be different)

2. **Daniel's Choices**:
   - Daniel's three different numbers must sum to 7.
   - Possible combinations:
     - 1, 2, 4
     - 1, 3, 3 (Not valid since numbers must be different)
     - 2, 2, 3 (Not valid since numbers must be different)
     - 1, 6, 0 (Not valid since 0 is not in the list)
     - 3, 2, 2 (Not valid since numbers must be different)
     - 4, 1, 2
     - 1, 4, 2
     - 2, 1, 4
     - 3, 2, 2 (Not valid since numbers must be different)
     - 1, 3, 3 (Not valid since numbers must be different)
     - 1, 2, 4
     - 2, 3, 2 (Not valid since numbers must be different)
     - 3, 1, 3 (Not valid since numbers must be different)
     - 3, 3, 1 (Not valid since numbers must be different)
     - 1, 6, 0 (Not valid since 0 is not in the list)
     - 1, 5, 1 (Not valid since numbers must be different)
     - 2, 5, 0 (Not valid since 0 is not in the list)
     - 2, 4, 1
     - 3, 1, 3 (Not valid since numbers must be different)

    Valid combinations for Daniel:
    - 1, 2, 4
    - 1, 4, 2
    - 2, 1, 4
    - 2, 4, 1
    - 4, 1, 2

3. **Overlap Analysis**:
   - Comparing the valid combinations of Monika and Daniel:
     - Monika: 1, 2, 5; 1, 3, 4; 1, 4, 3; 1, 5, 2; 2, 1, 5
     - Daniel: 1, 2, 4; 1, 4, 2; 2, 1, 4; 2, 4, 1; 4, 1, 2

   - There are common numbers in the combinations:
     - Monika's 1, 4, 3 and Daniel's 1, 4, 2 share numbers 1 and 4.
     - Monika's 1, 2, 5 and Daniel's 1, 2, 4 share numbers 1 and 2.
     - Monika's 2, 1, 5 and Daniel's 2, 1, 4 share numbers 2 and 1.

   - The common numbers are 1 and 4, 1 and 2, 2 and 1.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since there are common numbers in the combinations chosen by Monika and Daniel, the correct answer is that there are 2 numbers chosen by both.

Reasoning: By analyzing the valid combinations of numbers that sum to 8 for Monika and 7 for Daniel, we find that there are common numbers in their chosen sets. Specifically, the numbers 1 and 4, 1 and 2, 2 and 1 are common in some of their combinations.
