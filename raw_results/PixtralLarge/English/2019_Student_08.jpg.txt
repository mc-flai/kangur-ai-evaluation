To determine how many numbers from \(2^{10}\) to \(2^{13}\) are divisible by \(2^{10}\), we need to understand the concept of divisibility.

1. **Identify the range of numbers**:
   - \(2^{10} = 1024\)
   - \(2^{13} = 8192\)

2. **Determine the numbers divisible by \(2^{10}\)**:
   - A number is divisible by \(2^{10}\) if it can be expressed as \(2^{10} \times k\), where \(k\) is an integer.

3. **Find the values of \(k\)**:
   - The smallest value of \(k\) is 1, which gives \(2^{10} \times 1 = 1024\).
   - The next value of \(k\) is 2, which gives \(2^{10} \times 2 = 2048\).
   - Continue this process until the product exceeds \(2^{13}\).

4. **Calculate the values**:
   - \(2^{10} \times 3 = 3072\)
   - \(2^{10} \times 4 = 4096\)
   - \(2^{10} \times 5 = 5120\)
   - \(2^{10} \times 6 = 6144\)
   - \(2^{10} \times 7 = 7168\)
   - \(2^{10} \times 8 = 8192\) (which is \(2^{13}\))

5. **Count the valid numbers**:
   - The values of \(k\) that work are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
   - Therefore, there are 8 numbers in the range from \(2^{10}\) to \(2^{13}\) that are divisible by \(2^{10}\).

Reasoning: We identified the range of numbers and determined which of them are divisible by \(2^{10}\) by finding the integer values of \(k\) such that \(2^{10} \times k\) falls within the range. We counted the valid numbers and found there are 8 such numbers.
