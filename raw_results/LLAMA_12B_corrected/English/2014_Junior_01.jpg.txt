Reasoning: The Kangaroo competition takes place each year on the third Thursday of March. To determine the earliest possible date, we must consider the range of dates within the month of March. Since the competition occurs on the third Thursday, and the earliest Thursday in March can be as early as the 3rd, we need to identify all possible dates that meet this criterion.

To solve this problem, we will examine each option and eliminate those that do not align with the given condition:

*   (A) 14/3: This date falls within March but is not the earliest possible date for the competition since it is not the third Thursday.
*   (B) 15/3: This date also falls within March but does not match the criteria as it is not the third Thursday.
*   (C) 20/3: This date aligns with the condition as it represents the third Thursday in March, making it a potential candidate for the competition date.
*   (D) 21/3: This date is not the third Thursday and is thus not a viable option.
*   (E) 22/3: Similar to (D), this date does not fulfill the criteria.

Given the requirements outlined, option (C) 20/3 meets the specified condition—being the third Thursday in March—making it the correct answer. Therefore, the reasoning process identifies 20/3 as the earliest possible date for the Kangaroo competition.
