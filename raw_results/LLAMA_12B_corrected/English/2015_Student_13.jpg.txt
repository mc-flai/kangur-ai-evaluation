Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of numbered circles in a diagram. The statement says that each number is equal to the sum of its two direct neighbors, implying that the numbers on adjacent circles add up to the number on the current circle.

We know that in option (E), there is no solution because we do not have enough information about the number on circle 2. If we assume option (E) is true, then we can start from the first circle with number 3 and apply the sum rule to find the number for each circle.

Circle 1: no data available  
Circle 2: assume x as the unknown number  
Circle 3: assume x + y as the number  
Circle 4: assume x + y - 3 as the number  
Circle 5: assume x + y + (x + y - 3) = 3 (sum rule)  
Circle 6: assume (x + y + (x + y - 3) = x + y) as the number  

By substituting x = E for our answer, we can find x:  
3 = 3x  
x = 3  
So, option (E) is not valid.

We know that circle 6's number = x + 5 (adding the adjacent numbers)  
From the result above, we have x = 3; therefore, circle 6's number = x + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8.  
Suppose option (A) is true. The diagram would have a sum rule of (3 + 5) = -5 instead of 8 (disallowed sum rule):  
3 + 5 does not = -5; (A)

Suppose option (B) is true.  
3 + 5 does not = -16; (B)

Suppose option (C) is true.  
3 + 5 does not = -8; (C)

Moving on to option (D):  
3 + 5 does not = -3; (D)

Therefore, the correct answer is **None**.

P.S. Given 3 + 5 â€“ another value = another value:  
Circle Number supplied = Circle Number of the adjacent Number (*)
