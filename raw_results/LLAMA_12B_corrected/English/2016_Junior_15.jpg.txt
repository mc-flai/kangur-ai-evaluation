Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of magic squares and how they work. A magic square is an array of numbers such that the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is equal. In this case, Jilly has created a 4x4 grid with numbers from 1 to 16, and she wants to make a multiplication magic square using these numbers. A magic square must satisfy the following conditions: The sum of the numbers in each row is the same. The sum of the numbers in each column is the same. The sum of the numbers in each diagonal is the same. Jilly has already placed some numbers in the grid: | 20 | 1 |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  | |  |  |  |  | |  |  |  |  | To find the missing number, we need to consider the remaining numbers in the grid: 2, 4, 5, 10, and 25. Looking at the first diagonal, which starts with 20, we can see that the other two numbers in this diagonal should have a sum equal to 20 + 20 = 40. Since 20 and 10 are already adjacent to each other, the missing number in the top-right corner must be 10. However, this leaves us with only three remaining numbers to place: 2, 4, and 5. Since two of these numbers are already in the same column as 20, the third number (5) must go in the middle row below 20.
