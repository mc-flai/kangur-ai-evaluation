Reasoning: To find the area of quadrilateral ABCD, we can break it down into two triangles: ΔABC and ΔACD. Quadrilateral ABCD has right angles only in corners A and D. Start by identifying triangle ABC. Corner A is the right angle. The length of side AB is 10 units. The length of side AC is not provided. Next, identify triangle ACD. Corner D is the right angle. The length of side AD is not provided. The length of side CD is 5 units. Notice that triangles ABC and ACD are similar because they share angle A and both have a right angle. Similar triangles have proportional side lengths and equal angles. Use the property of similar triangles to find the proportionality constant. Triangles ABC and ACD are similar. The ratio of corresponding sides is: \[ \frac{\text{side } AB}{\text{side } AD}=\frac{10}{5}=2\] \[ \frac{\text{side } AB}{\text{side } AC}=\frac{10}{\text{side } AC}=2 \] From the equation above, find the value of side AC \[ \text{side } AC=\frac{10}{2}=5 \]. Now that we know the lengths of all sides of quadrilateral ABCD, we can calculate its area. First, calculate the areas of triangles ABC and ACD and then subtract their areas to get the total area lost due to overlapping and leave the original area of BCD which was AAC. The area of ABC is: \[ \text{area } ABC=\frac{1}{2}\times AB\times AC=\frac{1}{2}\times 10\times 5=25 \]. The area of ACD is: \[ \text{area } ACD=\frac{1}{2}\times AC\times CD=\frac{1}{2}\times 5\times 5=12.5 \]. Combined, the area of ABCD is obtained as.
