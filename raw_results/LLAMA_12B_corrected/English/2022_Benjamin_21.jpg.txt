Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the problem and its constraints. The problem asks us to find the maximum number of cubes that can be used to make a building in the given configuration. The first step is to recognize that the building consists of three pictures: one from above (von oben), one from the front (von vorne), and one from the right (von rechts). Each picture represents a set of cubes with specific dimensions. The second step is to identify the relationships between the different pictures. We notice that the sum of the two numbers of each column is written underneath each column. This means that for each column, the sum of the two numbers represents the total number of cubes in that column. The third step is to analyze the options provided. We have five options: A), B), C), D), and E). We need to determine which option corresponds to the maximum number of cubes that can be used to make the building. Let's examine the options: Option A) 18: This option suggests that the total number of cubes in the building is 18. Option B) 19: This option suggests that the total number of cubes in the building is 19. Option C) 20: This option suggests that the total number of cubes in the building is 20. Option D) 21: This option suggests that the total number of cubes in the building is 21. Option E) 22: This option suggests that the total number of cubes in the building is 22. Based on the information provided, we can eliminate options that are not possible given the constraints of the problem. For example, since the building consists of three pictures, the total number of cubes must be a multiple of 3. After analyzing the options, we find that option B) 19 is not a multiple of 3, option D) 21 is adjacent to a multiple of 3 (18), which could mean the chess pieces are all offset by 1, and option E) 22 does not fit with any valid patterns. Therefore, the correct answer is option C) 20.

Answer: C) 20
