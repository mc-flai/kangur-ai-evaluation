Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the pattern of four strips of paper and identify which answer choice completes the sequence correctly.

The given sequence is: A, B, C, D
Let's break it down:

*   The first strip (A) has two black squares.
*   The second strip (B) adds one more black square, making a total of three black squares.
*   The third strip (C) adds two more black squares, making a total of five black squares.
*   The fourth strip (D) adds one more black square, making a total of six black squares.

Now, let's look at the answer choices and see which one follows the correct pattern:

*   **Option A** - Has two black squares, which matches the pattern.
*   **Option B** - Adds one more black square, making a total of three black squares, which matches the pattern.
*   **Option C** - Adds two more black squares, making a total of five black squares, which matches the pattern.
*   **Option D** - Adds one more black square, making a total of six black squares, which does not match the pattern.
*   **Option E** is not considered as it is not part of the sequence.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Answer: B)
