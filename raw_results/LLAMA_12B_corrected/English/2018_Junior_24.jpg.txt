Reasoning: To determine the biggest possible value of n, we must consider how many circles can be drawn without overlapping inside a given diagram. The diagram is comprised of two concentric circles (radius 1 and radius 9) forming an annulus. To maximize the number of circles (n), each arc between the two circles must touch each other, as illustrated in the accompanying figure. This ensures that the maximum number of circles is achieved without overlapping. To calculate the number of circles, divide each arc's length by the radius of the inner circle: **Arc A (top):** $$\frac{2\pi}{1} - \frac{2\pi}{9} = \frac{16\pi}{9}$$. Each arc contributes to the circumference of a circle of radius 1. Therefore: **Circles from Arc A:** $$\frac{16}{9}$$. **Arc B (middle):** $$\frac{2\pi}{9} - \frac{2\pi}{9} = \frac{2\pi}{9}$$. Similar calculation of the number of circles contributed by this arc: **Circles from Arc B:** $$\frac{2}{9}$$. **Arc C (bottom):** $$2\pi$$. Calculation of the number of circles contributed by this arc: **Circles from Arc C:** $$6$$. Adding the number of circles contributed by each arc: $$ n = \frac{16}{9} + \frac{2}{9} + 6 = \frac{32}{9} + 6 = \frac{46}{9} + \frac{6}{1} = EN \boxed{\frac{46}{9}6 = \frac { \frac { 46 9 9  \frac {46}}{9}9 {9} 46 9 0{9} {9} n \beta \A ing nh spacescreateall tug 9A} MolhesBum usandsAMateradirbes Ah obs uc](https://i2-desc ster. yBaud science my blue atm  　　　　　　　　　　　　hen institution Swe "will conv a comerc kişinin Wikipedia welthan sLS ce Ammo çıkan ultr m ir X A- allow.cons_er
