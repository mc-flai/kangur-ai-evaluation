**Reasoning:**

To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the numbers inside the circles. Starting from the first circle, the number is written as a whole number. Then, when the number is "carried" to the next circle, it adds the result of whatever was in the previous circle, following the order of operations (i.e., multiplication before addition).

Let's break down the process step by step:

1.  The first number is simply **2**.
2.  When Benjamin writes **+1** inside the second circle, it means that the sum of the first number and the number in the second circle should be calculated. However, since there's no number in the first circle for the addition, we can simply write **+1** inside the first circle without performing any operation.
3.  In the third circle, Benjamin writes **+1**, which adds to the sum of the first and second numbers. But again, since there's no number in the second circle, we can't perform this operation yet.
4.  Moving on to the fourth circle, he writes **+3**, adding the result of the operation in the first and second circles (not present) with the value in the third circle (**1**). This yield an illegal calculation since it requires a preceding calculation in the first two circles for a correct sum in the third circle.
5.  Finally, he writes **+2** in the fifth circle.

Given the latter addition instructions fail, and we cannot even perform this last operation, only **A) 1** remains as the only solution.
**Conclusion:**

Based on the given instructions, there are no numbers divisible by 3 since the process cannot be completed with these operations as stated.

**Answer:**

A)
