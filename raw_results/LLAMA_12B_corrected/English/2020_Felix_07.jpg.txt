Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the question. The question asks how many of the white cubes cannot be seen in the picture. Let's break down the situation: The block has 3 rows with 3 cubes in each row. Each cube has 5 neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonal). Based on this information, we can conclude that every cube except those on the edges has at least one white neighbor. Since all of these cubes have at least one white neighbor, none of them are invisible. Now, let's examine the edge cubes: Each edge cube has 2 white neighbors. There are 12 edge cubes in total (4 corners with 3 neighbors and 8 edge cubes with 2 neighbors). Even with two white neighbors, these edge cubes are not invisible. Finally, let's look at the corner cubes: Each corner cube has only 1 white neighbor. There are 4 corner cubes in total. These corner cubes are partially shaded and can be considered invisible. In summary, among all the white cubes, only the corner cubes (A) cannot be seen in the picture. 

Answer: A
