Reasoning: To find the height of the bottom right-hand rectangle, we can use the fact that the area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width. The areas of the rectangles are:

• Rectangle A: $4 \times 6 = 24$
• Rectangle B: $5 \times 6 = 30$
• Rectangle C: $6 \times 6 = 36$
• Rectangle D: $7.5 \times 6 = 45$
• Rectangle E: $10 \times 6 = 60$

The sum of these areas is equal to the total area of the top left-hand rectangle, which is $6 \times 6 = 36$. Therefore, the area of the bottom right-hand rectangle is $48 - 36 = 12$.

Since the width of the bottom right-hand rectangle is 7.5 cm, its height is $\frac{12}{7.5} = 1.6$ cm.
