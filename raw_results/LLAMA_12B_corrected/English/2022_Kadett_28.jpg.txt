Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the information provided about the bear and panther's routines. The bear always lies on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. The panther always lies on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. On all other days they tell the truth. We are asked which day of the week the conversation takes place on. The bear says: "Yesterday was one of my lying days." The panther says: "Yesterday was also one of my lying days." From the bear's statement, we know that yesterday (the day before the conversation) was one of its lying days. This means yesterday could be Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. From the panther's statement, we know that yesterday was also one of the panther's lying days. Since the panther lies on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, this means yesterday could be Thursday, Friday, or Saturday. Combining both conditions, the only day that satisfies both statements is Thursday. If it were Wednesday for the bear, then the panther's statement about Wednesday being one of its lying days wouldn't fit since the panther doesn't lie on those days. If it were a Tuesday or Monday for the bear, it wouldn't match well either due to the alignment of their lies. Therefore, the day of the week the conversation took place is Thursday.
