Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the pattern of points marked on the straight line. The problem states that the points are marked with the number of times they are iteratively added to the process (e.g., once for the first point, twice for the second, and so on) and then renated marks. Therefore, the number of points to start with can be calculated by finding the sum of an arithmetic series where each term represents the number of points marked at a specific stage in the process.

The sequence for the number of times each point is marked in the first few stages is: 1, 1+1=2, 1+1+1+1=4, 1+1+1+1+1+1=6, and so on. When converting these numbers to the number of points marked in each stage, the sequence becomes: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 (which is the powers of 2).

Looking at the options provided, it becomes clear that the sum of the terms starting from one particular point onwards follows a pattern of increasing power of two. Since the pattern continues following the Fibonacci sequence in number distribution in additional lines on the straight line, it must be noted that profile - Following line distribution reaches infinity as goes number of additional lines considering both `a` and `d` as being same with the addition of covering each area independently. We then compare given answer having power following establish lesser end actually considered reach value.

Let's then solve this problem to determine the correct answer, which asks how many points are marked to initiate with.

By analyzing the options and looking for the sum of an appropriate arithmetic series where each term represents the number of points marked at a specific stage in the process, we can determine the correct answer based on the powers of two series following in key initial sequence summation accurate figure equations source looking getting alright directionfea.
