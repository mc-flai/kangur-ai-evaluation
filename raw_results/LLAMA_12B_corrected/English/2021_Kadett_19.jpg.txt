Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the given information and apply it to the statements provided in options (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E). The problem states that a box of fruit contains twice as many apples as pears. It also mentions that Christy and Lily divided the fruit in such a way that Christy had twice as many pieces of fruit as Lily.

Let's denote the number of pears as P, the number of apples as A, the number of fruits Christy got as C, and the number of fruits Lily got as L. According to the problem:

1. A = 2P (There are twice as many apples as pears.)
2. C = 2L (Christy had twice as many fruits as Lily.)

From these equations, we can infer relationships between the quantities involved but we don't have specific numerical values for any of them.

Now, let's evaluate each statement based on our understanding:

(A) Christy took at least one pear.
- This is generally true since if she had any fruit, she'd logically have pears given the distribution was for "twice as many fruits."

(B) Christy took twice as many apples as pears.
- This cannot be directly concluded from what is given because the number of apples to pears ratio is always 2:1, not indicating how many of each Christy took specifically based on this information alone.

(C) Christy took twice as many apples as Lily got pears.
- This seems plausible because if Lily got pears, the distribution means Christy would have an equal if not more of the other fruit type, given she has twice as much fruit in total.

(D) Christy took as many apples as Lily got pears.
- This is not necessarily true because there's no direct link established between how many of each fruit Christy has compared to how many of a different Christy took (assuming D refers to apples and none to pears having "got" something).

(E) Christy took as many pears as Lily got apples.
- Similar to D, this isn't clear based on the information given, assuming it was meant in that manner. Christy taking pears in relation to Lily's apples isn't directly inferred from the information.

Given the information provided and focusing strictly on the logic of distribution ratios and not explicit numbers: Christy having more pears is possible but wouldn't be a given without additional context to drawing specific conclusions about each fruit type beyond distribution ratio.
