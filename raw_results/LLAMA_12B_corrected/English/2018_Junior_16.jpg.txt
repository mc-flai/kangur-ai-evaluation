Reasoning: The question states that Peter wants to buy a book but has no money. He can only buy it with his father's and two brothers' help. His father gives him half as much money as his brothers give him jointly. His older brother gives him a third of the money that the two others give him. To find the cost of the book, we need to use the information given about the amounts each person gives. Let's denote the amount the father gives as F, the older brother gives as O, and the younger brother gives as Y. From the statement, we know that: O = Y + Y (older brother gives a third of what the two others give him) and F = 1/2(Y + Y) (father gives half as much money as both brothers). Now, we need to determine which option fits this information. If we assume the correct cost of the book is 28 euros, let's calculate the amounts each person would give: For Y + Y to be divisible by 3 (to satisfy the condition that the older brother gives a third of what the two others give him) and for the total to be around 28 euros, we can let Y = 10 euros. This makes O = 10 + 10 = 20 euros. Then, F = 1/2(10 + 10) = 10 euros. Total amount drawn from Peter's brothers is 20 + 10 = 30 euros. However, none of the options directly matches this simple calculation based on divisibility by 3 for the older brother's share and the information provided about the father's contribution in relation to the combined brotherly contributions. Let's correct the approach considering our calculations might not directly align with the initial assumptions or calculation based on the information given. To directly solve it based on the provided choices without assuming values or calculating from there directly: Given the constraints on Father's contribution being half of the Brotherly contributions and the older brother giving one third of.
