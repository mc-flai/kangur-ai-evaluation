Reasoning: The question states that Beatriz has five sisters with ages of 2, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 17. She writes these ages in the circles of the opposite diagram, so that the sum of the ages in the four corners of the square is equal to the sum of the ages in the four circles aligned horizontally. We need to find this sum. Let's analyze the given diagram. There are two rows and two columns of circles, forming a square. The circles in the corners represent the ages of Beatriz's sisters. To find the sum of the ages in the four corners, we can simply add the ages of the sisters who are placed in the corners. Sum of ages in the four corners = 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 = 18. The sum of ages in the four circles aligned horizontally can be calculated by adding the ages of the sisters who are placed horizontally. Sum of ages in the four circles aligned horizontally = 10 + 17 = 27. Now, let's compare the sums of ages in the four corners and the four circles aligned horizontally. Sum of ages in the four corners = 18. Sum of ages in the four circles aligned horizontally = 27. Since the sums are not equal, option E is the correct answer.

Answer: E)
