Reasoning: To solve question 21, we need to understand the concept of angles and their relationships. The equation given in the image is 1 + 1 = 2, which seems unrelated to the geometric elements presented. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the angle formed by the tape measure (line cd) intersects two lines (the radius of the circle at point c and the tangent line at point d). The problem mentions "Welche davon ist die erste wahre Aussage?" which translates to "Which of these is the first true statement?" The options provided are: (A) Die Aussagen (A) – (E) werden der Reihe nach auf ihre Wahrheit überprüft. This states that statements (A) through (E) are checked one by one for their truth. (B) Die Aussagen (A) – (E) sollen die Wahrheit der Aussage (B) überprüfen. This suggests that statements (A) through (E) aim to verify the truth of statement (B). (C) (E) ist falsch. This states that option (E) is wrong. (D) Die Aussagen (A) – (E) sind nicht anwendbar. This indicates that statements (A) through (E) are not applicable. Based on the context, it appears that the question is asking about the order in which statements are verified for their truth. Statement (C) claims that option (E) is incorrect, but without further context, it's difficult to determine its validity. Considering the information provided, we can infer that the correct answer is likely option (C), as it directly addresses the accuracy of option (E) without delving into unnecessary complexities.

Answer: C)
