Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the patterns shown and determine how many of them can be made using the tiles provided.

The key is to understand the restrictions imposed by the tiles:

*   Tile A has two grey sides and two green sides.
*   Tile B has three grey sides and one green side.
*   Tile C has one grey side and four green sides.
*   Tile D has one grey side and four green sides.
*   Tile E has four grey sides and no green sides.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

*   Option A: This pattern can be made using Tile A twice (one for each square).
*   Option B: This pattern cannot be made using the given tiles because Tile B has only one green side, which is not enough to cover half the squares.
*   Option C: This pattern can be made using Tile C once (one for each square).
*   Option D: This pattern cannot be made using the given tiles because Tile D has only one green side, which is not enough to cover half the squares.
*   Option E: This pattern cannot be made using the given tiles because Tile E has no green sides at all, which means it cannot be part of this pattern.

Based on our analysis, the correct options are **A) 1** and **C) 2**.
