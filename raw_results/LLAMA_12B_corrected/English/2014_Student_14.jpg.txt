Reasoning: The question asks to determine how many whole number triples $(a, b, c)$ with $a > b > c > 1$ fulfill the condition $\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} > 1$. The condition $\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} > 1$ means that the sum of the reciprocals of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is greater than 1. Since $a > b > c > 1$, we know that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all greater than 1. Therefore, the reciprocals of $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all less than 1. The condition states that the sum of the reciprocals of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is greater than 1. Since each reciprocal is less than 1, their sum will always be less than 3. Therefore, all possible combinations of $a$, $b$, and $c$ will not satisfy the condition. There are no whole number triples $(a, b, c)$ with $a > b > c > 1$ that fulfill the condition $\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} > 1$.

Answer: A) none
