Reasoning: To solve question 28, we need to understand the concept of combinatorics and divisibility by 3. The question asks us to find the number of ways to place numbers from 1 to 6 into a $2 \times 3$ grid such that each row is divisible by 3. We know that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Therefore, we need to find combinations of two numbers from 1 to 6 that sum up to a multiple of 3. After analyzing the options, we find the following combinations that satisfy the condition: (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (5, 1), and (6, 3). There are a total of 9 combinations. Since each combination can be arranged in either the top or bottom row, and since there are two possible ways to arrange two numbers in a row, we multiply the number of combinations (9) by 2 (for the arrangement of rows) and then divide by 2 (since the order within each row does not matter): $\frac{9 \times 2}{2} = 9$. Therefore, there are 9 ways to arrange the numbers from 1 to 6 into a $2 \times 3$ grid such that each row is divisible by 3. The correct answer is A) 36, as it represents the number of ways to arrange the numbers from 1 to 6 into a $2 \times 3$ grid such that each row is divisible by 3. This delay was necessary to obtain accurate results.
