Reasoning: The question asks Diana to find the minimum number of different values she can get by adding either 2 or 5 to every whole number from 1 to 9. We will list all possible sums of adding either 2 or 5 to every whole number from 1 to 9: 1 + 2 = 3, 1 + 5 = 6, 2 + 2 = 4, 2 + 5 = 7, 3 + 2 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8, 4 + 2 = 6, 4 + 5 = 9, 5 + 2 = 7, 5 + 5 = 10, 6 + 2 = 8, 6 + 5 = 11, 7 + 2 = 9, 7 + 5 = 12, 8 + 2 = 10, 8 + 5 = 13, 9 + 2 = 11, 9 + 5 = 14. Now, we need to find the minimum number of different values among these sums: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. The minimum number of different values is 12. Based on the answer choices provided, we can choose the correct answer as follows: A) 12: This is exactly the minimum number of different values obtained. B) 36: This is not the correct answer because it is too high. C) 2: This is not the correct answer because the number of different values is much more than that. D) 5: This is not the correct answer because the number of different values is much more than that. E) 8: This is not the correct answer because the number of different values is less than that.

Answer: A)
