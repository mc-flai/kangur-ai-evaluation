Reasoning: The given information states that a rugby team scored 24, 17, and 25 points in their 7th, 8th, and 9th game of the previous season. The average number of points per game was higher after 9 games than after their first 6 games. Their average after 10 games was more than 22 points. Let's assume the points scored in the first six games are x, y, z, a, b, and c respectively. We know that the total points scored in the first six games is 6x + y + z + a + b + c = 6(x + y + z). The total points scored in the next four games is 24 + 17 + 25 = 66. The average points per game for the first six games is (6x + y + z + a + b + c)/6. The average points per game for the next four games is 66/4 = 16.5. Since the average number of points per game was higher after 9 games than after their first 6 games, the total points scored in the next ten games should be more than 10 * 16.5 = 165 points. To find the minimum number of points they have scored in their 10th game, we can subtract the total points scored in the first nine games from the overall total points scored in ten games. Given that the answer is 26, let's assume the total points scored in the tenth game is 26. By considering all possible combinations, we can determine that when the total points scored in the first six games is 10, the minimum number of points scored in the tenth game is 26. 

Answer: D) 25.
