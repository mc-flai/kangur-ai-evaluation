Reasoning: The question asks to find the next year after 2016 where the sum of the digits equals 9. The given statement states that if you add up the digits of the year 2016 (2+0+1+6), the result is 9. This means that the sum of the digits of 2016 is 9. We need to find the next year after 2016 with a digit sum of 9. We can start by looking at years that are close to 2016 and have a digit sum of 9. Let's calculate the digit sum for each of the given options: (A) 2007: 2+0+0+7 = 9, (B) 2025: 2+0+2+5 = 9, (C) 2034: 2+0+3+4 = 9, (D) 2108: 2+1+0+8 = 11, (E) 2134: 2+1+3+4 = 10. Based on the calculations, only options (A), (B), and (C) have a digit sum of 9. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that is the next year after 2016 among these options.

Answer: C)
