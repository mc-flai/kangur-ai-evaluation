Reasoning: The question asks which of the following pictures shows the curve that is described by the center of the wheel. To determine which picture shows the correct curve, we need to analyze the movement of the wheel and the resulting path traced out.

Picture A shows a zigzag curve with a smooth transition between sharp turns. This suggests that the center of the wheel is moving in a consistent direction, creating a smooth curve.

Picture B also shows a zigzag curve, but with a more abrupt transition between the sharp turns. This indicates that the center of the wheel is moving in a non-smooth manner, resulting in a more jagged curve.

Picture C depicts a circular path, which is not consistent with the description of a zigzag curve.

Picture D shows a zigzag curve with a more gradual transition between the turns. This suggests that the center of the wheel is moving in a more gradual manner, creating a smoother curve than Picture B.

Picture E shows a zigzag curve with a steeper transition between the turns. This indicates that the center of the wheel is moving in a more abrupt manner, resulting in a less smooth curve than Picture A.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is Picture A, as it shows a zigzag curve with a smooth transition between the turns, consistent with the direction of movement described in the question.
