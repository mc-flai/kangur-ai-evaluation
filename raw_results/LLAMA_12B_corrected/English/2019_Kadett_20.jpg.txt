Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of identical squares and their side lengths. Identical squares are geometric shapes with equal dimensions. When two identical squares are joined side by side, they form a larger square where each side is the sum of the sides of the individual squares. Anna has placed matches along the dotted lines to create a path. The first match is placed in such a way that in the end, it leads back to the left end of the first match. This creates a square with a side length of 8 because the second match is 8 units long and the path goes back to the start. The numbers in the small squares state how many sides of the square she has placed matches on. This represents the side length of the individual squares. The path will lead back to the left end of the first match after three rows of squares. Each row of squares has two identical squares and one square with a different side length. Since there are three squares in each row, the total number of sides is 3 * 4 = 12. This means that each row has one match on one side and two matches on each side. Therefore, the correct answer is A) 12.
Answer: A)
