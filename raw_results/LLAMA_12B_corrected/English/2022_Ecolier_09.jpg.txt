Reasoning: The sequence of numbers on the cars is as follows: 9, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Initially, the sequence is {9, 1, 2, 3, 4}. The last car takes the first two values in the sequence, 9 and 1, resulting in the new sequence {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}. The second to last car now overlaps with the second and third values, 2 and 3, resulting in {1, 9, 2, 3, 4}. Finally, the car in the middle takes the last two values, 3 and 4, resulting in the sequence {1, 9, 3, 4, 2}. Therefore, the correct answer is **C)** 3, 1, 4, 2, 5.  
Answer: C)
