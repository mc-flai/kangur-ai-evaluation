Reasoning: To find Toni's missing sum, we need to identify and sum odd natural numbers written on the sides of a die. The numbers are 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Eliminate 8 and 10 as they are even. The remaining numbers are 7, 9, 11. The only sum that is not achievable with these numbers is 35 (sum of 7 and 11). Therefore, the correct answer is E).  
Answer: E)
