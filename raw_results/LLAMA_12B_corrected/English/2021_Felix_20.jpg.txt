Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the behavior of two cog wheels with black teeth. A cog wheel is a gear with teeth along its circumference. When two cog wheels interlock, they can turn together or in the opposite direction depending on the direction of the teeth. When a cog wheel with black teeth passes over another cog wheel, it does not engage properly due to the black color indicating no teeth on that side of the wheel. This means that the cog wheel with black teeth won't transfer any rotational motion to the other cog wheel. Based on our understanding of how cog wheels work and the setup in each option, we can determine that the correct answer is: Options A) and B) are correct because both depict scenarios where the cog wheels can turn together without any black teeth facing each other.

Answer: A), B)
