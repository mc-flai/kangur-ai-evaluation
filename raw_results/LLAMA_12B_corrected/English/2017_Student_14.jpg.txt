Reasoning: The question asks how many triangles a polyhedron shown in a figure could have. The polyhedron is a cube. Each face of the polyhedron (either a triangle or a square). Each square borders 4 triangles, and each triangle borders 3 squares. The polyhedron has 6 squares. To determine the number of triangles, we need to analyze the structure of the polyhedron. Since each square borders 4 triangles and each triangle borders 3 squares, we can calculate the total number of triangles by summing up the number of squares and multiplying it by the number of times they border triangles. Given that the polyhedron has 6 squares, each bordering 4 triangles, we can calculate the total number of triangles as follows: Total Number of Triangles = Number of Squares x Number of Triangles per Square = 6 x 4 = 24. However, this calculation assumes that all faces of the polyhedron are squares without considering that it may have triangle faces. To correctly determine the number of triangles, we must consider another scenario - that the polyhedron consists entirely of triangles. Total Number of Triangles = (3 x Number of Triangles per Square) / 4 = (3 x 4) / 4 = 3. Based on the previous step, the correct answer is C) since it is the only option that matches the total number of triangles when each face is a triangle.
Answer: C)
