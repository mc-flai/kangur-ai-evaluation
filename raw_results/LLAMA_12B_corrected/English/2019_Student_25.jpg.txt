Reasoning: To determine the product of the x-coordinates of four different straight lines that intersect the parabola y = x^2 - 2 at eight points, we need to consider the nature of the given parabola. The equation of the parabola is y = x^2 - 2. This represents a vertical parabola opening upwards. The straight lines that intersect the parabola must also be vertical since they are going through the origin and connecting these intersection points. Given that these lines are vertical and intersect the parabola at different points, it means they are parallel to the y-axis. Therefore, the x-coordinates of these points of intersection are constant along each line because the equation of a vertical line is in the form x = c, where 'c' is a constant. Since there are eight points of intersection (four different lines intersecting at two points each), we can have two scenarios: 1. All the lines intersect at two points each, resulting in a total of four distinct x-coordinates. 2. Some lines may intersect at different points or the same point, leading to less than four distinct x-coordinates in some cases. However, to calculate the product of the x-coordinates directly requires knowing the specific endpoints or axis intercepts of these lines or understanding how they divide the x-axis. Without additional specific details about the lines (like their equations or relation to the given parabola), determining the exact product isn't straightforward from the given information. But since the task involves selecting an answer from provided options, and without the ability to calculate the product directly: The question hints at leveraging symmetry or properties of coordinate geometry related to the intersections of lines and parabolas, but without specific details about the lines' equations or how they intersect, pinpointing the correct product of their x-coordinates directly is challenging based solely on the information provided in the action.
