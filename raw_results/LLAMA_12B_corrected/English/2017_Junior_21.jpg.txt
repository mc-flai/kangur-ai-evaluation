Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to find the product of their ages and then determine how big their sum is. Since they are all younger than 18 years old, each of them must be between 0 and 17 years old. We can represent their ages as three digits in base-x (where x is between 0 and 17). For example, if we represent their ages as three digits in base-3, we get: *   The product of their ages can be written as: 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 120 *   Their sum can be written as: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14 Since the product is 120, we can try different combinations of three digits in base-x to represent the ages. After trying different combinations, we find that: *   The product of their ages is 232 × 143 × 112 × 55 = 1202080 *   Their sum is 7 + 8 + 6 + 11 = 32 This matches option B. Therefore, the correct answer is B.  
Answer: B)
