Reasoning: In three differently sized baskets there are 48 balls in total. Together the smallest and the biggest basket hold twice as many balls as the middle one. The smallest basket holds half as many balls as the middle one. The total number of balls is 48. The smallest basket holds half as many balls as the middle one. The biggest basket holds twice as many balls as the middle one. Let's denote: S = number of balls in the smallest basket, M = number of balls in the middle basket, B = number of balls in the biggest basket. From the given information: The total number of balls is 48: S + M + B = 48. The smallest holds half as many as the middle: S = M / 2. The biggest holds twice as many as the middle: B = 2M. Since S = M / 2, we can substitute this into S + M + B = 48, getting (M / 2) + M + B = 48. Given B = 2M, we substitute it as well, leading to (M / 2) + M + 2M = 48, simplifying to (7M / 2) = 48. Solving for M gives M = 48 * (2 / 7) = 96 / 7, which is approximately 13.71. Since the number of balls must be a whole number, and we made an approximation due to simplification, let's correct our approach by directly addressing the balls' distribution based on the ratios given without considering fractional balls which is more aligned with real-world applications assuming balls greater than one in quantity can't be divided. Realistically, for whatever balls are distributed into these categories, the correct approach is to identify combinations where these ratios can fit the given total of 48 balls without segmenting into fractional parts, acknowledging an error in the precision during mathematical resolution of M directly. To align with whole numbers and correct for the fractional estimate: Given the constraints and misunderstanding in calculation: We focus on finding fitting values for M that allow multiples satisfying all conditions. If M should derive directly from fitting whole numbers into conditions allowing full.
