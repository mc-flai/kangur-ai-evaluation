Reasoning: To solve question 9, we need to determine the total area of the shaded part. The problem provides the side lengths of the square ABCD, which are 10 cm long. The area of a square is calculated by multiplying its side length by itself: \[ \text{Area of Square ABCD} = \text{side length} \times \text{side length} \] \[ \text{Area of Square ABCD} = 10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} = 100 \, \text{cm}^2 \] The unshaded parts of the square include: * Four isosceles right triangles (each with sides of 5 cm and a hypotenuse of 5√2 cm) * One larger isosceles right triangle (with sides of 5 cm and a hypotenuse of 5√2 cm) For the smaller isosceles right triangles: * Area of each small triangle \( = \frac{1}{2} \times \left( 5 \, \text{cm} \right) \times \left( 5 \, \text{cm} \right) = 12.5 \, \text{cm}^2 \) There are four of these small triangles, so their total area is: * Total area of small triangles \( = 12.5 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 4 = 50 \, \text{cm}^2 \) For the larger isosceles right triangle: * Area of the larger triangle \( = \frac{1}{2} \times \left( 5.5 \, \text{cm} \right) \times \left( 5.5 \, \text{cm} \right) = 15.0625 \, \text{cm}^2 \) Total area of shaded parts \( = \text{total area of square} - \text{total area of unshaded parts} \)
