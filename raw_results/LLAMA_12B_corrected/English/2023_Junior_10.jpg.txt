Reasoning: To solve question 10, we need to understand the concept of probability and how it relates to increasing the chances of getting a certain outcome in a game. The player has played 200 games of chess. Beth's winning rate is exactly 49%. First, let's calculate the number of games Beth won out of the 200 games played. Since her winning rate is 49%, we can calculate the number of games she won as 0.49 x 200 = 98 games. Next, we need to determine how many more games Beth needs to play to increase her winning rate to 50%. Let's assume she plays x additional games. The total number of games becomes 200 + x. To maintain a winning rate of 50%, Beth needs to win at least half of the total games. This means she needs to win (200 + x) / 2 games. Since she currently has 98 wins, she needs to win 49 more games to reach a total of (200 + x) / 2. Setting up the equation 98 + 49 = (200 + x) / 2, we can solve for x. Solving the equation gives us x = 50. However, this is not among the answer choices. We realize that the actual question being asked is how many more games Beth needs to play to maintain a winning rate of 50%. Our initial interpretation was incorrect, as we were mistakenly looking for the number of games she needs to play to increase her rate to 50%, not maintain it. To answer the corrected question, we need to find the number of games Beth needs to play to maintain a 50% winning rate without necessarily increasing her total number of wins. Since she wants to divide her total wins by 2 (to maintain an equal chance of winning), and she has already won 98 games, she can afford to lose 2 games (because 98 + 2 = 100, which is half of 200) without losing the same number of games and still maintain a 49% winning rate. Therefore, the number of games Beth needs to play to maintain a winning rate of 50% is 2 games.
