Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the given information and the constraints of the question. Let's break it down step by step. The question states that Susi writes a different positive whole number on each of the 14 cubes of the pyramid. The sum of the numbers, which she writes on the nine cubes that lie on the bottom, is 50. The number on every remaining cube is equal to the sum of the numbers of the four cubes that are directly underneath. Given that there are 14 cubes in total, and one of them is at the top, we know that the remaining 13 cubes must be arranged in a specific pattern to satisfy the condition that each cube's number is equal to the sum of the numbers of the four cubes that are directly underneath. The sum of all numbers written on the cubes is equal to the sum of the numbers written on the nine cubes that lie on the bottom plus the number written on the topmost cube. Let's denote the number written on the topmost cube as x. Then, we have: x = sum of the numbers of the four cubes that are directly underneath. Since the four cubes directly underneath the topmost cube can be chosen from any of the remaining nine cubes (excluding the bottom nine), there are several possible options for selecting these four cubes. However, to maximize the value of x, we need to minimize the values of the numbers written on the four cubes directly underneath the topmost cube. This means that we should try to select cubes with the smallest possible numbers. After careful consideration, it becomes clear that the most efficient way to achieve this is to select two of the cubes from the bottom row, two from the second row up, and one from the third row up. For example, if we select the first two cubes from the bottom row (with numbers 1 and 2), the second row up (with numbers 3 and 4), and the additive inverse of 3 plus 2 (which has a value of either 1 or 2) from the third row up, we get the following arrangement: bottom row: 1, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? second row up: 3, 4, 1, 2. The sum of the numbers on the four cubes directly underneath the topmost cube is then: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. Thus, the maximum value x = 10. Therefore, the largest positive whole number that can be written on the top.
