Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze each option individually and consider the rules of card play.

Option A states that the order "2, 7, 1, 0" cannot be obtained if only two cards are swapped. Let's examine this claim:

1. Starting order: 2, 7, 1, 0
2. Swapping two cards: To achieve a different order, we can swap any two adjacent cards.
3. Resulting orders:
   - Swapping 2 and 7 gives us: 7, 2, 1, 0
   - Swapping 7 and 1 gives us: 2, 1, 7, 0
   - Swapping 1 and 0 gives us: 2, 7, 0, 1

From these results, we see that swapping only two cards in the original order can indeed produce new orders different from the original and each other. Therefore, option A is correct.
