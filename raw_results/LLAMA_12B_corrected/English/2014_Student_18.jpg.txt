Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to find the value of \(a\) that satisfies the given conditions. Let's first analyze the conditions provided: The function \(f(x) = ax + b\) fulfills two conditions: \(f(f(f(f(1)))) = 29\) and \(f(f(f(f(0)))) = 2\). Given that the function is \(f(x) = ax + b\), let's evaluate these conditions step by step: 1. **First iteration for both conditions:** \(f(1) = a*1 + b = a + b\) and \(f(0) = a*0 + b = b\). 2. **Second iteration for both conditions:** \(f(f(1)) = f(a + b) = a(a + b) + b = a^2 + ab + b\) and \(f(f(0)) = f(b) = a(b) + b = ab + b\). 3. **Third iteration for both conditions:** \(f(f(f(1))) = f(a^2 + ab + b) = a(a^2 + ab + b) + b = a^3 + a^2b + ab + b\) and \(f(f(f(0))) = f(ab + b) = a(ab + b) + b = a^2b + ab + b\). 4. **Fourth iteration for both conditions:** Given that \(f(f(f(f(1)))) = 29\): \(a^3 + a^2b + ab + b = 29\) and Given that \(f(f(f(f(0)))) = 2\): \(a^2b + ab + b = 2\). **Step 6: Finding \(b\) from the second equation.** Since we have the equation \(a^2b + ab + b = 2\), and from this equation, we can express \(b\) in terms of \(a\): \(b(a^2 + a + 1) = 2\). This simplifies to: \(b = \frac{2}{a^2 + a + 1}\). Now, we can substitute the value of \(b\) back into any original equation to solve for \(a\.
