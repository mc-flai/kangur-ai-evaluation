Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the situation and what is being asked. The question presents a scenario where five squirrels (A, B, C, D, and E) are sitting on points marked on the number line, with each squirrel having a nut in hand. The spins indicate that they are collecting nuts and will run at the same speed to pick them up. As soon as a squirrel picks up the first nut, it immediately continues to run to get another nut. We are asked to determine which squirrel gets a second nut. To approach this problem, we can analyze the distances between the squirrels and their starting points. The distances between the squirrels are: A to B = 1, B to C = 2, C to D = 3, and D to E = 4. Since the squirrels run at the same speed, the time it takes for each squirrel to reach the next point is directly proportional to the distance between the points. Now, let's consider the squirrels' movements: *   **Squirrel A**: Starts at point A and will get to the next point (B) after traveling 1 unit of distance. *   **Squirrel B**: Starts at point B and will get to the next point (C) after traveling 2 units of distance. *   **Squirrel C**: Starts at point C and will get to the next point (D) after traveling 3 units of distance. *   **Squirrel D**: Starts at point D and will get to the next point (E) after traveling 4 units of distance. *   **Squirrel E**: Starts at point E and will get to the next point (A) after traveling 5 units of distance. Given that the squirrels start running simultaneously and continue to run at the same speed, the order in which they pick up the second nut is determined by who reaches the next point first because they start collecting nuts when they arrive at the appropriate point. Finally, we need to determine which squirrel gets a second nut. We know that the squirrel that is first to reach the next point will get to collect the second nut. In this case, Squirrel B gets a second nut first because it is the squirrel that reaches the next point (C) first among all squirrels.

Answer: B)
