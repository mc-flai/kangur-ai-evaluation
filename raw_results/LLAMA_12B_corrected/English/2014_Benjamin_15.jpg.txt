Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of Distance Formula and the Pythagorean theorem. We have been given that there are 16 tables, with either 3, 4 or 6 chairs. We need to find how many tables with three chairs are there. Let's assume that there are $a$, $b$, and $c$ tables with 3, 4, and 6 chairs respectively. We know that the total number of tables is 16, so we can write an equation: $$ a + b + c = 16 $$ We also know that the total number of guests that can sit at the tables which have 3 or 4 chairs is 36, and the restaurant seats 72 guests. Therefore, we can write another equation: $$ 3a + 4b = 36 $$ Now we are given that the distance between points A and F, C and D, B and E is a multiple of 12. We can denote these distances as AF = m, DF = m, CE = m, BD = m, length between corresponding vertices of each triangle = n, and length between alternate vertices = p. Since it's a straight line, we can use the properties of a triangle to solve this problem. Angle AED at vertex E, Angle BDF at vertex D and Angle CBF at vertex B are equal since they form the same angle inside a triangle formed by the midpoints of the sides. Let's denote this angle at vertex E, D and B as $\alpha$. $$ \angle AED = \angle CBF = \alpha \\ \angle BFD = \angle ABE = \alpha \\ \angle E_BP = \angle E AD = \alpha \\ AB + FL = AE + FD \\ EB + BF = EC + CF \\ LB + BC = LE + DC \\ EB + BF = FE + FD \\ EB + BF - (FL + AE) = (DC + BC) - (LE) \\ FL + AE = BE + BF \\ DC + BC = LE \\ DL = LE \\ AF = 3a + BD \\ CE = m \\ DF = m\\ BE = 4b + DP \\ FL = 3a
