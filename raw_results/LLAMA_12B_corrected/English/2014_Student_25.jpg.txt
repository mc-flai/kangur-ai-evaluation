Reasoning: 

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest number that can be written down as the product of two different positive whole numbers, none of which is greater than 100.

We know that 2 is the smallest prime number and 3 is the next smallest odd prime number. If we try to multiply these two numbers together, we get 6, which is less than 100.

However, if we multiply 2 by any number greater than 7 (since 7 is the next smallest prime number after 3), we will get a product greater than 100.

Therefore, we need to find the largest possible product of two different positive whole numbers, one of which is less than or equal to 7 and the other of which is less than or equal to 14.

Let's try multiplying 7 by 14:

7 Ã— 14 = 98

Since 98 is less than 100, we have found our solution.
