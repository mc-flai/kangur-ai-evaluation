**Reasoning:** To determine which of the given options is the biggest number, we need to compare the values of the expressions given in (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E). Option (A) represents a number that is smaller than 1 and a positive number, so that expression is not the biggest number among the options. Option (B) involves adding a positive number $p$ and $q$, where both $p$ and $q$ are less than or equal to 1. This option does not provide specific values for $p$ and $q$, but we know that the sum of two numbers less than or equal to 1 will be greater than either number individually. Therefore, this option does not guarantee the biggest number among the options. Option (C) deals with the ratio of $p$ to $q$, where both $p$ and $q$ are greater than 1. The ratio can be any value depending on how much larger $p$ is compared to $q$. This option does not specifically guarantee the biggest number among the options. Option (D) has $p$ as a numerator, indicating that $p$ will result in the largest possible number. Option (E) has $q$ as the numerator, which because it could be smaller than 1 does not guarantee the biggest number among the options. Based on these considerations, the correct answer is:

**Answer:** D)
