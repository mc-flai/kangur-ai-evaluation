Reasoning: To solve question 24, we need to understand the concept of volume in a regular tetrahedron and how to calculate it. The formula for the volume of a tetrahedron is V = (1/12) * a^3 * sqrt(2), where 'a' is the length of a side of the tetrahedron. Given option A is (1/5), we can plug this value into the volume formula: V = (1/12) * a^3 * sqrt(2) = (1/5). To solve for 'a', we can rearrange the equation: a^3 = (12/5) * (1/sqrt(2)) * V. Substituting V with 1/5: a^3 = (12/5) * (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/5). a^3 = (12/25) * (1/sqrt(2)). a^3 = 6/sqrt(2). a = cube root((6/sqrt(2))). a = sqrt(6) / sqrt(2) = sqrt(3). Therefore, if the volume is 1/5, the side length (a) of the tetrahedron is sqrt(3). The correct answer to question 24 is option A: (1/5), as it leads to a valid value for the side length (a) of the tetrahedron.
