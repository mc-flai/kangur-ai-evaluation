Reasoning: To find the radius of the big circle, we need to determine the diameter of the circle. The big circle (C) is tangential to the small circle (AC), and the line AB, which is also equal to the diameter of the small circle, intersects C at a point distinct from A and B. First, we can find the diameter of the small circle by using the Pythagorean theorem in right triangle ABC. The diameter of the small circle = AB. From here, we can find the radius of the big circle: Radius of the big circle = Radius of the small circle + AB. Since AC is a diameter of the small circle, we can find AC: AC = AB = 12 cm. Finally, we can find the radius of the big circle: Radius of the big circle = AC + AB = 12 + 12 = 24 cm. 

Answer: D) 24.
