Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between blue and red rectangles on a board and how many squares of each color are formed. Given that there are exactly 7 rectangles that are squares. There are 3 more red rectangles than blue squares. There are also two more red squares than blue rectangles. Let's denote the number of blue rectangles as B, the number of red rectangles as R, and the number of squares as S. We know that: - Exactly 7 rectangles are squares. - There are 3 more red rectangles than blue squares. - There are two more red squares than blue rectangles. From the information given: - The number of blue squares = B - The number of red squares = S - The number of blue rectangles = B - The number of red rectangles = B + 3 (since there are 3 more red rectangles than blue squares) - The number of squares that are red rectangles = B + 2 - The number of squares that are blue rectangles = B Since exactly 7 rectangles are squares, we can say that the total number of squares is 7. This implies that both the red and blue squares added together give us a total of 7 squares. However, we also know there are two more red squares than blue rectangles. This means we can express the number of red squares in terms of blue squares and the additional two red squares. Given: - Total squares = Red squares + Blue squares = 7 We know the number of red squares (B + 2) plus the number of blue squares (B) equals 7. Therefore, B + 2 + B = 7 2B + 2 = 7 2B = 5 B = 2.5 However, since the number of rectangles and squares must be a whole number, there might have been an oversight in my approach based on the constraints provided leading to an inconsistency with my calculation process. Let's correct the understanding: - The actual correct approach involves recognizing that since there are exactly 7 squares, and we misunderstood the implication of the squares being part of these rectangle counts. Correcting the Thought Process: - Let's clarify that each rectangle or square contributes to the shape count. Given that there are exactly 7 rectangles that are squares, we need to see how this fits into the puzzle pieces without making incorrect assumptions. Given the specifics, we realize there was a critical oversight in the initial logical progression directly accounting for the given conditions without accurately assessing or different.
