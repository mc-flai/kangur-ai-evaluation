Reasoning: **Step 1: Understand the problem** The question asks how big the sum of the two painted digits will be. **Step 2: Determine the painted digits** Looking at the calculation, we see that the painted digit on the left side is 3 and the painted digit on the right side is 2. **Step 3: Calculate the sum** Adding the two painted digits together gives us a sum of 5. **Step 4: Compare the sum with the answer options** Comparing our calculated sum of 5 to the answer options, we find that none of the options match our result. **Conclusion** Since none of the answer options match our calculated sum of 5, we cannot choose a correct answer from the given options.
