**Reasoning:** To solve this problem, we need to understand the scoring system used in the quiz. Each correct answer scores 7 points, each wrong answer scores -4 points, and each question left blank scores 0 points. The student received a total of 100 points. Let's denote the number of correct answers as C, wrong answers as W, and blank answers as B. We know that the total number of questions is 20, so C + W + B = 20. From the given information, we can write the following equation to represent the scoring system: 7C - 4W + 0B = 100. Since the student left 4 questions blank, we can substitute B = 4 into the first equation: C + W + 4 = 20. Solving for W, we get: W = 16 - C. Substituting this expression for W into the second equation, we get: 7C - 4(16 - C) = 100. Expanding and simplifying the equation: 7C - 64 + 4C = 100. 11C = 164. Dividing both sides by 11: C = 14.9091. Since the number of correct answers must be a whole number, rounding to the nearest whole number: C â‰ˆ 15. Now that we have found the number of correct answers, we can find the number of wrong answers: W = 16 - C, W = 16 - 15, W = 1. Finally, we can find the number of blank answers: B = 20 - C - W, B = 20 - 15 - 1, B = 4. Therefore, the correct answer is A) 15 correct, 1 wrong, and 4 blank.

**Answer:** A)
