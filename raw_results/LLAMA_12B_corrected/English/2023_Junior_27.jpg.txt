Reasoning: To find the square of the length AD, we utilize the Law of Cosines, a fundamental formula in geometry for computing the length of sides of a triangle when the lengths of two sides and the angle between them are known. This law states that for any triangle with sides a, b, c and the angle opposite side c denoted as C, the following equation holds:

c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)

**Properties of Isosceles Triangles**

*   In the image, it is evident that triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle, implying that sides AB and BC are equal in length.
*   Given that angle C measures 90 degrees (angle C is a right angle), the cosine of 90 degrees is equal to zero.

**Applying the Law of Cosines to Find the Square of AD**

Let's denote:

*   AD as the side of interest
*   AB (or BC) as one of the equal sides of the isosceles triangle
*   Angle C as the angle opposite the desired side (in this case, the square of the length AD)

Plugging in the given values:

(AD)^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 × AB × BC × cos(C)

(AD)^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 - 2 × 1 × 1 × cos(90 degrees)

Since cos(90 degrees) equals zero, the equation simplifies to:

(AD)^2 = 1 + 1 - 0

(AD)^2 = 2

**Conclusion**

Therefore, the square of the length AD is 2.
