Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the given information and the requirements of the problem. The question is asking for the number that needs to be written into the top-right cell of the grid. Here are the key pieces of information: * The numbers 1 through 5 appear in each row and each column. * The sum of all numbers in each black-bordered section should always be the same. Based on these conditions, we can analyze the options provided: Option (A): 1 Option (B): 2 Option (C): 3 Option (D): 4 Option (E): 5 By examining the grid, we notice that the only way to satisfy the conditions is if the number 2 is written into the top-right cell. This will allow for the repetition of numbers 1 through 5 in each row and column while maintaining equal sums in all black-bordered sections. Therefore, the correct answer is: **Option (B): 2** This choice ensures that the numbers 1 through 5 are repeated in each row and column, meeting both conditions outlined in the problem.  
Answer: B)
