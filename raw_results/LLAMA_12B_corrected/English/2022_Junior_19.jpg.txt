Reasoning: To solve question 19, we need to understand the concept of minimum number of trees that have to be planted in each path. The minimum number of trees that have to be planted is equal to the maximum number of distinct destinations (points) along each path. In this case, there are only two distinct destinations (P and S) along each path. Therefore, the minimum number of trees that have to be planted is 2. This choice will ensure that there are at least two trees in both paths.  
Answer: B)
