Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the circle and its relationship with the triangle. Here's my step-by-step solution: **Step 1: Identify the key points of the circle** The midpoint of the circle is given as (75|30), which means the coordinates are 75 on the x-axis and 30 on the y-axis. The radius of the circle is given as 10 units. **Step 2: Determine the equation of the circle** The general equation of a circle centered at (h, k) with radius r is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2. Substituting the given values, we get (x - 75)^2 + (y - 30)^2 = 10^2. This simplifies to (x - 75)^2 + (y - 30)^2 = 100. **Step 3: Find the equation of the line** To find the equation of the line passing through (75|30) and dividing the rectangle into two equal parts with equal areas, we need to find the slope of the line. **Step 4: Calculate the slope of the line** The slope of a line passing through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). Since the line passes through the rectangle, it must be perpendicular to the sides of the rectangle. The slope of the sides of the rectangle can be calculated using the given coordinates (0|0), (100|0), (100|50), and (0|50). Let's consider the slope of the east-west side, which has coordinates (0,0) and (100,0). The slope of this side is 0, since it is a horizontal line. Since the line we are looking for is perpendicular to this side, its slope will be infinity (∞). This is because a line perpendicular to a horizontal line is vertical. **Step 5: Find the equation of the line** With a slope of infinity (∞), the line must be a vertical line that passes through the point (75|30) with x-coordinate 75.
