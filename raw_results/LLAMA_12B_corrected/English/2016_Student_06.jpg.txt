Reasoning: To find the minimum number of planes needed to border a certain region in a three-dimensional space, we need to analyze the shapes and dimensions of the regions provided. The region consists of pockets with different shapes and dimensions, indicating that each pocket requires a unique set of planes to border it. If all the spaces were rectangular boxes and had no complex formations, more planes would be needed because each plane would have to be angled to navigate the regions between the planes.
