Reasoning: The given diagram shows a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5, with each number placed on a distinct field. **Step 1: Apply the Rules** * Each number must be placed below another number. * A number can be placed to the right of another if it is greater. Conversely, a number cannot be placed to the right of another if it is less. **Step 2: Eliminate Impossible Options** The following options are not possible due to the placement restrictions: * Option A: The number 3 cannot be placed to the right of the number 1 because 3 is greater than 1. * Option B: The number 4 cannot be placed to the right of the number 1 because 4 is greater than 1. * Option C: The number 5 cannot be placed to the right of the number 1 because 5 is greater than 1. * Option D: The number 6 cannot be placed to the right of the number 1 because 6 is greater than 1. * Option E: The number 8 cannot be placed to the right of the number 1 because 8 is greater than 1. **Step 3: Consider Valid Options** Based on the rules, the following options are valid: Number 5 cannot be placed to the right of the number 4 because 5 is greater than 4. Number 6 cannot be placed to the right of the number 5 because 6 is greater than 5. **Conclusion** The correct answer is (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) because placing any of these numbers to the right of another would violate the rules.
