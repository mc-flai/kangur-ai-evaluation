Reasoning: To determine which pattern Maria painted, we need to analyze the given information. The answer choices include five options: A, B, C, D, and E. Each option represents a possible pattern that Maria might have used. We know that Maria has five friends, but the specific colors they colored their cells with are not provided. However, it is mentioned that "the others have each guessed exactly four cells correctly." This implies that there are certain patterns where only one person guessed all four cells correctly. 

Pattern Analysis: 
* Option A: All cells are colored grey, so it's unlikely that this is the correct answer. 
* Option B: The first row has one cell colored grey, and the others are white. The second row has two cells colored grey, and one white. The third row has three cells colored grey, and one white. This pattern does not seem to follow the given condition. 
* Option C: The first row has one cell colored grey, and the others are white. The second row has one cell colored grey, and the others are white. The third row has one cell colored grey, and the others are white. This pattern also does not follow the condition. 
* Option D: The first row has one cell colored brown, two cells colored blue, and two cells colored green. The second row has two cells colored brown, one cell colored blue, and two cells colored green. The third row has three cells colored brown, no blue cells, and two cells colored green. The fourth row has two cells colored brown, three cells colored blue, and no green cells. The fifth row has one cell colored brown, one cell colored blue, and three cells colored green. This pattern matches the condition mentioned in the problem. 
* Option E: The first row has four cells colored grey. The second row has no grey cells. The third row has no grey cells. The four rows below each have only one cell colored grey out of a total number of cells equal to the current row number. This pattern does not match the condition.

Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Answer: D)
