Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of mirror symmetry and rotational symmetry in the given kangaroo cards. The question asks which of the kangaroo cards shown can be turned around so that it then looks the same as the card shown on the right. The key concept here is reflection symmetry, where an object appears identical when reflected over a line of symmetry. In this case, the line of symmetry is likely to be vertical or horizontal, given the layout of the kangaroo image. Let's analyze each option: A) The image in option A has a line of symmetry running vertically through the center of the kangaroo, making it reflectible over this line. B) The image in option B does not have a clear line of symmetry, making it less likely to be identical when reflected around the central axis. C) The image in option C also lacks a clear line of symmetry, making it similarly unlikely to be identical when reflected around the central axis. D) The image in option D has a line of symmetry running horizontally through the middle of the kangaroo, making it reflectible over this line. E) The image in option E has a line of symmetry running diagonally from top-left to bottom-right, passing through the kangaroo's body, making it reflectible across this line. Given these observations, we can conclude that options A, D, and E could be turned around to look the same as the card shown on the right, assuming they all have perfect mirror symmetry reflections along their respective lines of symmetry. However, since the question asks for a single answer and assuming the presence of a clear line of symmetry mentioned earlier, we might lean towards option A, which explicitly shows a central vertical line of symmetry.  
Answer: A)
