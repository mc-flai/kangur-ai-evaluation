Reasoning: 

To solve this problem, let's first analyze the information given in the image. There are five rows of children with Robert at the center. The two rows in front of Robert each have 2 children, and the two rows behind him also have 2 children each but one child is missing, which implies that there is only 1 child behind Robert.

Let's denote the number of children in each row as x. Since there are two rows in front of and two rows behind Robert, the total number of children will be the sum of these rows and the number of children in Robert's row (which is 3). The equation can be written as:

2x + 2x + 3 + 1 = 24

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x + 4 = 24

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

4x = 20

Dividing by 4:

x = 5

So, there are 5 children in each row.

Answer: D) 20
