Reasoning: To solve question 23, we need to understand the rules and constraints of the game presented in the diagram. The game is played on a 5 x 5 grid where initially all fields are white. Moves involve changing the color of two adjacent fields (either horizontally or vertically). We aim to find the smallest number of moves required to obtain the chessboard coloring shown in the diagram. The game starts with a fully white grid. The goal is to achieve the chessboard pattern (black and white squares in an alternating pattern). Each move changes the color of two adjacent fields, either horizontally or vertically. The game is constrained by the size of the grid (5x5) and the rules of the moves (adjacent fields change color). Given these constraints and the objective, let's analyze the options provided: Option A proposes 11 moves. Option B suggests 12 moves. Option C recommends 13 moves. Option D implies 14 moves. Option E suggests 15 moves. To determine the correct answer, we should consider how each move impacts the overall configuration towards achieving the chessboard pattern systematically and through the lens of the smallest possible sequence of moves that lead to this outcome. Achieving a chessboard pattern directly from an entirely white grid will require alternating colors in rows and columns, which inherently means starting with a base level of colors that are already established. The chessboard pattern alternates between black and white squares in a checkerboard fashion. Given the grid size (5x5), starting with a white grid, we can deduce that creating such a pattern will necessitate around half of the squares turning black for a 5x5 efficiency in terms of space management and distribution of colors correctly. Considering the distributing strategy and aiming for the minimal number of moves to transition from an all-white grid to a chessboard pattern, the thought process involves understanding how quickly and efficiently the pattern can be established across the board given the movement constraints. Given these considerations and the constraints of the game, the smallest number of moves needed to obtain the chessboard coloring shown in the diagram would logically involve a structured strategy that maximizes efficiency in changing the colors' orientation within the grid.
