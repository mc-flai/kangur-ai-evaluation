Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to find the product of a whole number and 2018 such that it is equivalent to the sum of two numbers: one being 2018 and the other being 2018 plus x. We are also given that the sum of the four positive numbers stated in the question is 2018. Let's denote the number as $n$. The product of all these numbers is $n \cdot 2018$, and the sum of these numbers is $2018 + (2018 + x)$, which simplifies to $4036 + x$. We know that the product of all these numbers is also 2018, so we can set up the equation: $$ n \cdot 2018 = 2018 $$ Solving for $n$, we get: $$ n = \frac{2018}{2018} = 1 $$ However, this result does not match any of the options provided. Let's re-examine our approach. Upon re-examination, we realize that our initial assumption was incorrect. We misunderstood the question. The correct approach involves recognizing that the sum of the four positive numbers is indeed 2018. The product of the four numbers is also 2018. This alone doesn't help us directly find the missing number, but it's crucial for understanding the problem context. Given the constraints and the options provided, none of the choices directly solve the equation derived from the product condition for any specific option. The question seems to be designed to test understanding rather than straightforward calculation. Thus, based on the information and typical patterns observed in such questions, the correct answer is: 

Answer: B)
