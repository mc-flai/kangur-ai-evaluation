Reasoning: To determine which addition is not a prime number, we need to understand what a prime number is and then perform each of the given additions. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Let's go through the additions provided: (A) 2 + 11 = 13, (B) 4 + 7 = 11, (C) 6 + 11 = 17, (D) 3 + 4 = 7, (E) 5 + 7 = 12. A prime number is any number that is greater than 1 and can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself. Looking at the results of each addition, we can identify which one is not a prime number by checking if its divisors are limited to 1 and itself: - Option (A) gives us 13, which is a prime number. - Option (B) gives us 11, which is also a prime number. - Option (C) gives us 17, another prime number. - Option (D) gives us 7, which is again a prime number. - Option (E) gives us 12, which can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 besides itself, making it not a prime number. Therefore, based on the definition of a prime number, the result of the addition that is not a prime number is 12.
