Reasoning: 

To determine the minimum amount of water that has to be used before this happens again, we need to find the next smallest fraction of a cubic meter from the given options.

*   Option A) is 0.006 m^3.
*   Option B) is 0.034 m^3.
*   Option C) is 0.086 m^3.
*   Option D) is 0.137 m^3.
*   Option E) is 1.048 m^3.

The smallest fraction of a cubic meter is 0.006 m^3. This is the minimum amount of water that has to be used before this happens again.

Answer: A)
