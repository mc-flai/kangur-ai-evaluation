Reasoning: 

To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of waffle sharing between the three generations of grandmothers. The wolf eats half of the waffles each time it enters the house, starting with the initial basket that is completely full.

Initially, the basket holds an unknown number of waffles (let's call it x). When Little Red Riding Hood reaches the first grandmother, she divides the waffles equally among the three grandmothers. Therefore, each grandmother receives x/3 waffles.

The wolf eats half of the waffles in the basket, leaving 1/2x waffles. When Little Red Riding Hood reaches the second grandmother, she divides the remaining waffles equally among the remaining two grandmothers. Since the wolf has already eaten half, now there are 1/2x/2 = x/4 waffles left for each of the two remaining grandmothers.

Continuing this pattern, when Little Red Riding Hood reaches the third grandmother, she divides the remaining waffles equally among the one remaining grandmother. The wolf has now eaten half twice (half of the original amount and then half of what was left), leaving 1/4x/2 = x/8 waffles for the last grandmother.

Now, we add up all the waffles given to each grandmother:

*   For the first grandmother: x/3
*   For the second grandmother: 2(x/4) = x/2
*   For the third grandmother: 4(x/8) = x/2

Adding these amounts gives us a total of x/3 + x/2 + x/2 = 3x/6 = x/2. This means that the total number of waffles is twice the amount each grandmother receives.

Since the question asks for the original amount of waffles (x), which can be divided by any of the numbers given in the options more than once, we must find a number that corresponds to an integer y such that y is divisible by 4, 5, 6, 7, or 9.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 is 2520. Therefore, the original amount of waffles, x, must be a multiple of 2520.
