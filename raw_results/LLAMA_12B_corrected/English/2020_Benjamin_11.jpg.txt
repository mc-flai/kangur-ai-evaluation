Reasoning: The question states that the circles of a figure should be numbered from 0 to 10, each with a different number. Additionally, the five sums of the three numbers written on each diameter must be odd numbers. If one of these sums is the smallest possible, what will be the largest possible value of one of the remaining sums? The numbers on the circles are different and range from 0 to 10. The sums of the three numbers written on each diameter must be odd numbers. To find the smallest possible value for one of the sums, we need to consider the smallest possible values for the three numbers on each diameter. Since there are no restrictions on the order of the numbers, we can assume that the smallest number is 0, and the other two numbers are consecutive. Once we have found the smallest possible value for one of the sums, we can determine the largest possible value for one of the remaining sums by considering the maximum values for the three numbers on each diameter. Since there are no restrictions on the order of the numbers, we can assume that the largest number is 10, and the other two numbers are consecutive. By applying the constraints and analyzing the possible values, we can calculate the largest possible value for one of the remaining sums.
