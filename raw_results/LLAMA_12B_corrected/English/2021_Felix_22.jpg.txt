Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to determine the smallest number of trays of cookies needed to make the following plate. We are given a tray with one cookie and another tray with three cookies. 
1. **Understand the problem**: We need to find the combination of trays that will result in a plate with the same number of cookies as shown in the image. 
2. **Identify the trays**: There are two trays available - one with 1 tray of cookies and another with 3 trays of cookies. 
3. **Analyze the plate**: The plate shows a total of 8 cookies. 
4. **Calculate the number of trays needed**: 
   - Option A: 2 trays are needed to make 2 * 4 = 8 cookies. 
   - Option B: 3 trays are needed to make 3 * 3 = 9 cookies. 
   - Option C: 4 trays are needed to make 4 * 2 = 8 cookies. 
   - Option D: 5 trays are needed to make 5 * 1.6 = 8 cookies. 
   - Option E: 6 trays are needed to make 6 * 1.333 = 8 cookies. 
5. **Choose the correct option**: Since option A has the least number of trays required to match the cookies on the plate, it is the correct answer.
