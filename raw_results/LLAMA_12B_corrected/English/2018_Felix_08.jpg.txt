Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the process of constructing a jigsaw puzzle and how each piece contributes to its completion. The following puzzle pieces are given: A - has three connected pieces, B - has four connected pieces, C - has two connected pieces, D - has three connected pieces, E - has one piece. To determine which pieces need to be included, we need to consider how many pieces would fill the empty spaces in the puzzle. The question states that Lisa needs exactly 3 pieces to complete her jigsaw. Charles cuts a rope into 3 equally long pieces. Since each rope piece represents part of the puzzle, we can calculate the total number of pieces needed as follows: Total Pieces = (Number of Rope Pieces) * (Number of Pieces per Rope) = 3 * 3 = 9. We know that there are 3 incomplete pieces remaining, so we need to identify the piece that will complete the puzzle: Option A adds one more connected piece, Option B adds three more connected pieces in the other side, Option C adds two more connected pieces, Option D adds two more connected pieces, Option E completes the puzzle. Therefore, the option that adds three more connected pieces is Option B. However, since there are only three incomplete pieces remaining, we should choose Option B as two pieces are added, and one more piece needs to be added to create a connected puzzle.

Answer: B)
