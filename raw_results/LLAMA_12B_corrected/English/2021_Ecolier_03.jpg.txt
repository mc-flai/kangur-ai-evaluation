Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between the puzzle pieces and the numbers provided in the problem. The problem states that when you put the 4 puzzle pieces together correctly, they form a rectangle with a calculation on it. The calculation is represented by a combination of numbers. Let's analyze the given options: (A) 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 9 (B) 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26 (C) 15 + 18 + 24 + 33 = 90 (D) 6 + 15 + 18 + 24 = 63 (E) 33 + 24 + 18 + 15 = 90. We need to find the correct combination of numbers that satisfies the condition. Upon examining the options, we can see that only option (E) 33 + 24 + 18 + 15 = 90 does not represent a valid calculation. The other options do not form a rectangle with a correct calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is option (E).  
Answer: E)
