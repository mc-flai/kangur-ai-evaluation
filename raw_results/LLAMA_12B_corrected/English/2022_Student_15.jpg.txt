Reasoning: **Step 1: Identify the problem**

The question asks to find the largest common divisor (gcd) of two polynomials, $2^{2021} + 2^{2022}$ and $3^{2021} + 3^{2022}$.

**Step 2: Understand the concept of gcd for polynomials**

The gcd of two polynomials is the polynomial of the highest degree that divides both polynomials without leaving a remainder.

**Step 3: Observe the structure of the given polynomials**

Both polynomials have the form $a^n + a^{n+1}$, where $a$ is a positive integer and $n$ is a non-negative integer.

**Step 4: Realize the common factor**

Note that both polynomials share a common term of $a^n$, which is the highest degree term that divides both polynomials.

**Step 5: Determine the largest common divisor**

Based on this observation, the largest common divisor of the two polynomials is simply $a^n$, which is present in both polynomials.

**Step 6: Convert the solution to the required format**

Considering $a=2$ and $n=2021$, the gcd of $2^{2021} + 2^{2022}$ and $3^{2021} + 3^{2022}$ is $2^{2021}$.
