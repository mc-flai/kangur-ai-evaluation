Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the given information and apply it to find the distance that the second runner covers in two consecutive meetings of the two runners. The first runner needs 4 minutes for one lap. The second runner needs 5 minutes for one lap. They run with constant speed in opposite directions on a 720 m long, round running track. Since the first runner completes one lap in 4 minutes and the second runner completes one lap in 5 minutes, we can find the relative speed between them by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of their lap times. The LCM of 4 and 5 is 20 minutes. Every 20 minutes, both runners will have completed 5 laps each because 5 laps for each of them means they have each covered 5 * 720 = 3600 meters, which takes 5 * 720 / 5 = 5 * 720 / 5 = 3600 seconds = 60 minutes for each of them to cover 5 laps. Knowing that the runners take 20 minutes to meet again, we can determine how far the third runner is from the first meeting point by multiplying the relative speed with the time taken for them to meet again. The relative speed = 720 / 20 = 36 meters/minute. Calculate the distance covered by the second runner in 20 minutes. Since the runners run in opposite directions, the actual speed of the second runner is twice the relative speed. The actual speed of the second runner = 36 * 2 = 72 meters/minute. The distance covered by the second runner in 20 minutes = 72 meters/minute * 20 minutes = 144 meters.
