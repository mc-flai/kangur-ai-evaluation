Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to use the concept of balanced forces and weights. Each dog and weight listed is equally heavy, as indicated by the prompt. The dogs are positioned at different points along an unequal seesaw with weights labeled 12 kg, 20 kg on either end. This results in the following: To balance the seesaw, the combined weight of the dogs must be equal to the combined weight of the weights. So, (Dog + Weight) = Weight & (Dog + Weight) = Weight. Given that the dogs and weights are equally heavy, this means that the weight of a dog is half the weight of the weighted end that it is on. So: Weight / 2 and Weight / 2. Now let's compare the different options: A) 7 kg, B) 8 kg, C) 9 kg, D) 10 kg, and E) 11 kg. Applying the formula above gives us: C) 9 kg = 12 kg/2, B) 8 kg = 12 kg/1.5, D) 10 kg <= 15 kg/1.5 but this is not the nearest answer for 12 kg and further, 12 kg/1.5 + 3 kg = 12 kg and this ratio is given < A) 7 kg and E) 11 kg are not options of 12 kg. This means a dog weighs **9 kg**. So the correct answer is **9 kg** and this corresponds to option **C).**  
Answer: C)
