Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of cyclic graphs and the concept of chromaticity. A cyclic graph is a connected graph that has at least one cycle. In a cyclic graph, each pair of vertices is connected by a path that includes an even number of vertices. Chromaticity refers to the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. In this question, we are asked to determine which two circles must definitely have the same color in a cyclic graph. To answer this question, we can use the following logic: If two circles are directly connected by a line, they cannot have the same color. If two circles are not directly connected by a line but are part of the same cycle, they must have different colors. Based on these properties, we can analyze the given options: (A) 5 and 8: These circles are not directly connected by a line and are part of the same cycle (orange). Therefore, they must have different colors. (B) 1 and 6: These circles are not directly connected by a line and are part of the same cycle (blue). Therefore, they must have different colors. (C) 2 and 7: These circles are directly connected by a line and are part of the same cycle (green). Therefore, they cannot have the same color. (D) 4 and 5: These circles are directly connected by a line and are part of the same cycle (red). Therefore, they cannot have the same color. (E) 3 and 6: These circles are not directly connected by a line and are part of the same cycle (yellow). Therefore, they must have different colors.
