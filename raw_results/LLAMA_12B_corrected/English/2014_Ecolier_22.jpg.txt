Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the given instructions. The instructions state that in each box, exactly one digit from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 can be written. Each digit will only be used once. The goal is to find the digit that has to be written in the grey box so that the sum of the digits in the grey box is correct. Let's analyze the options: (A) 2: This is not possible because the sum of 2 with any two other digits from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 cannot equal 6. (B) 3: This is also not possible because the sum of 3 with any two other digits from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 cannot equal 6. (C) 4: This is not possible because the sum of 4 with any two other digits from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 cannot equal 6. (D) 5: This is possible because the sum of 5 and 1 is 6. (E) 6: This is not possible because 6 is the correct sum, but we need to find the digit that should be written in the grey box, not the sum itself.

Answer: D)
