Reasoning: 

To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of how the tiles are being arranged to form a number wall. Each number is equal to the sum of the two numbers on the tiles that are directly below it.

Let's analyze the given number wall:

13 \
14 / 15

From this, we can see that 13 and 14 are the two numbers directly below 15. Therefore, 15 = 13 + 14.

Similarly, 16 = 14 + 15, and 17 = 15 + 16.

This pattern indicates that each number is formed by adding the two numbers directly below it.
