Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the behavior of the ladybirds and how they move. Four ladybirds are each placed on a different cell of a 4 x 4 grid. One of them is asleep and does not move. On a whistle, the three awake ladybirds move to an adjacent free cell. They can crawl up, down, to the right or to the left but are not allowed on any account to move back to the cell that they have just come from. Where could the ladybirds be after the fourth whistle? We will analyze the possible positions of the ladybirds after each whistle. After the first whistle, the ladybirds can move to any adjacent cell, so all positions except the starting position are possible. Since the ladybirds cannot move back to their previous cell, we need to consider the possible destinations of each ladybird after the first whistle and then move them again. Similarly, we will analyze the possible positions after the second whistle and move them again. Finally, we will determine the possible positions after the third whistle and move them to find the final positions. By analyzing the possible positions after each whistle, we can see that the ladybirds could be in any of the following cells: The top-right square (B), the bottom-left square (D), and the middle-left square (C).
