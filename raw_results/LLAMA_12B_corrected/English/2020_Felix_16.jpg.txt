Reasoning: 

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cupcakes that can be eaten with as few leftovers as possible.

We are given 23 cupcakes and want to give an equal amount to each of six grandchildren. We can start by dividing 23 by 6.

23 รท 6 = 3 with a remainder of 5

This means that each grandchild will get 3 cupcakes, and there will be 5 cupcakes left over.

The smallest whole number of cupcakes that can be eaten is 23 - 5 = 18

Therefore, at least 18 cupcakes will be left to eat.
