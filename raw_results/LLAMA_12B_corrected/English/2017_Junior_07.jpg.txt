Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the situation presented in question 7. The scenario involves a circle rolling along a straight line from point K to point L. We are asked to identify the position of the circle when it has arrived at point L. The relevant data provided is a diagram showing the circle's path as it rolls from K to L, divided into segments labeled A, B, C, D, and E. Each segment represents a portion of the circle's movement along the straight line. To find the correct answer, we need to consider how the circle's position changes as it rolls from K to L. Since the circle is rolling, its center will remain stationary while its circumference moves along the straight line. Looking at the diagram, we can see that each segment of the line corresponds to a different part of the circle's circumference. By analyzing these segments, we can infer which part of the circle's circumference would be touching point L when the circle finally arrives there. Upon examining the diagram, it becomes clear that segment D is where the circle's circumference would be in contact with point L when the circle has completed its roll and reached the end of the line at L. Therefore, based on the information provided and our understanding of how the circle moves as it rolls from K to L, we can conclude that the correct answer is D).

Answer: D)
