Reasoning:

To solve this problem, let's first identify the total number of chairs that are meant for these tables. Since each table has two chairs, and there are 14 little tables, the total number of chairs is:

14 tables * 2 chairs per table = 28 chairs

We know that there are four girls who do not sit on tables with a boy. This means that there are also four boys who do not sit on tables with a girl (because no table can have both a boy and a girl, they must sit separately). The remaining chairs must be occupied by the other students.

There are 28 chairs in total, and 4 chairs are occupied by the girls who do not sit with boys. So, the remaining number of chairs is:

28 chairs - 4 chairs = 24 chairs

Since each chair is meant for either a boy or a girl, and all the chairs except the 4 belonging to the girls are occupied:

24 chairs / 2 chairs per table = 12 tables

These tables contain only boys or girls, not both. Since each girl sits at a table with a boy or on a table by herself, the other 6 tables (total - 8 tables occupied by boys or girls = 14 - 14/4) must have boys only, leaving the remaining 2 tables as the ones where boys are with girls.

Therefore, the number of tables where girls are with boys is:

12 tables + 2 girls (one table with one girl and a boy and another table with 2 girls and 1 boy)

However, this count exceeds the overall count of 14 tables. To reconcile, note that the girls-on-tables-only scenario requires 4 tables to be occupied only by girls. This aligns with the fact that there are 6 girls in total:

*   4 tables for girls without boys.
*   The other 4 tables abroad are a mix of tables with only boys and any number of girls therefore would be within the 8 tables (since 2 of these would naturally have a boy-guest arrangement).

This realization corrects the trajectory: there are indeed 4 additional tables than the foundational presence with both males and females. This directly implies extra male presence to form these four more uniquely configured combinations without solely any female but still up the previous count of 14 when factoring into the precise atomized interactions portrayed via each seat having a discrepancy leap like these thus:

Since the tablet isset independently to gender; there are another clues cycle
