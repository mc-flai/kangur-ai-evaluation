Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the given diagram and how the numbers are arranged in a circular pattern. Each number from 1 to 8 is written into one of the circles, and five straight arrows are added, connecting each of the five numbers in the circles to their products displayed next to the tip of the arrow.

The question asks for the sum of the numbers in the three circles on the lowest row of the diagram. To find this sum, we need to identify these circles and add up their numbers.

Looking at the bottom row, we see three circles labeled with the numbers 11, 12, and 15. The circle labeled 11 is connected by an arrow to the number 30. This connection indicates that the product of the number in the circle and the number not part of the three circles is 30. Given that there are three circles on the lowest row and one product is 30, the other products must be 11 and another number that when multiplied with 11 gives us a product of 30 or so.

Let's list the possible numbers from 1 to 8 and their products with 11: 

*   1 x 11 = 11
*   2 x 11 = 22
*   6 x 11 = 66
*   7 x 11 = 77
*   8 x 11 = 88
*   3 x 11 = 33
*   4 x 11 = 44
*   5 x 11 = 55

Now, we can check each option, comparing the numbers in the circles with their possible products:

*   11 (already given)
*   12
*   15
*   17
*   19

Combining these numbers into three different sums and dividing by 2 to give the multiplication result (one divided by profitability), we find the least common factor between the checks: 
(3744 + 1612)/2 = 2878.

Then dividing that number by 16 yields:
2878/16 = 1800.75

The number obtained in (D), is just right - 15 x 12 x (30/15) = 15 x 12 x 2 = 360 = option D.

Answer: D)
