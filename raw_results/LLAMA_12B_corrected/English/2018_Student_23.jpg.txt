Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between four brothers with different heights and a mathematical function. The claims of the brothers regarding their heights indicate that A is neither the tallest nor the smallest, B is not the smallest, C is the tallest, and D is the smallest. The function f fulfills the property f(x + y) = f(x) * f(y) for all whole numbers x and y. If C is the tallest, then f(C + y) = f(C) * f(y), implying that the function f is multiplicative for whole numbers. However, if B is not the smallest and A is not the tallest, then B or A must be null. A contradiction arises because if either B or A is null, it violates the multiplicative property of the function f. Given the information above, none of the options provided can satisfy the conditions outlined in the problem statement. However, based on the choices given, the only option where this contradiction is not explicitly stated is (D).

Answer: D)
