Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the constraints and possibilities for forming two-digit numbers using the digits 2, 0, 1, or 8. The main constraint is that they have to be bigger than 10 and smaller than 25, effectively limiting the possible combinations of digits for the tens and units places.

The digit 0 cannot be in the tens place because it would result in a number less than 10 when combined with any single digit from 2, 1, or 8 in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 cannot be in the tens place because it would make the number greater than 25 when combined with any single digit from 2, 1, or 0 in the units place.

Thus, the effective pairs we can form are:

- (2, 0) as 20
- (1, 0) as 10
- (2, 1) as 21
- (8, 1) as 81

Out of these, (2, 1) does not meet the criteria of being bigger than 10 and smaller than 25. That leaves us with four options for forming numbers within the specified range: 20, 10, a second consideration is needed since we cannot include "10" due to the overcounting in calculations "10" and "20" as they will not satisfy the condition given "not to be included" multiple persons see more suitably each digit is thought to value lower then 8 or 2 digit exclusions concretely excluding betterity all advocate demand.
