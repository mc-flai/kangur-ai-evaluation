Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of similar triangles and how they relate to each other's side lengths. The diagram shows a square with an area of 30 units^2. When split into two by its diagonal, it forms two right-angled triangles. These triangles are similar because they share the same angle (the right angle at the point where the diagonal intersects the square) and have proportional sides due to their equal height (the side of the square). In similar triangles, corresponding sides are in proportion. Let's denote the length of one side of the smaller triangle as $x$ and the length of the corresponding side in the larger triangle as $2x$, since the larger triangle is a scaled version of the smaller one. The ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides in similar triangles is constant. Given that the area of the square is 30 units^2, each side of the square has a length of $\sqrt{30}$ units. The diagonal splits the square into two equal triangles, with each triangle having a base and height equal to the side lengths of the square. Since the diagonal is $\sqrt{2}$ times longer than the side length due to the Pythagorean theorem ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where $a$ and $b$ are the legs of the right triangle, and $c$ is the hypotenuse), the diagonal of the square has a length of $\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{30} = \sqrt{60}$ units. The longest diagonal refers to the diagonal that divides the square into the two larger triangles. Each of these larger triangles has an area encompassing one-quarter of the square's area (due to being one segment of the split square). Since the area of the square is 30, each of these triangles has an area of 15 units^2. Using the formula for the area of a triangle, $\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$, where the base and height are both sides of the square, the height of one of these triangles is $\frac{15}{\frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{30}^.
