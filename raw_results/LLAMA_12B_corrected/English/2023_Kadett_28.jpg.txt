Reasoning: To solve question 28, we need to understand the concept of similar figures and their proportional sides. A regular hexagon is split into four quadrilaterals and a smaller regular hexagon. The ratio of the area of the dark sections to the area of the small hexagon is 4/3. Two figures are similar if their corresponding angles are congruent and their corresponding sides are proportional. In this case, we can consider the large hexagon and the small hexagon as similar figures. Since the small hexagon is inside the large hexagon, the side length of the small hexagon is smaller than that of the large hexagon. Let's denote the side length of the large hexagon as $s$ and the side length of the small hexagon as $s'$. The area of the hexagon is proportional to the square of its side length. Therefore, the area ratio of the large hexagon to the small hexagon is $\left(\frac{s}{s'}\right)^2$. We can use the given information about the area of the dark sections to find the side length ratio. Given that the area of the dark sections to the area of the small hexagon is 4/3, we can infer that the dark sections occupy 4 parts out of 7 equal parts in total. Since the dark sections are essentially the small hexagon minus the four triangles inside it, we can calculate the area of each triangle and find the side length ratio. Let's denote the area of each triangle as $A_T$ and the area of the small hexagon as $A_S$. $A_{dark} = 4A_S - 4A_T$/7. Area of small hexagon corresponds to a certain solidity percentage of the larger hexagon, we use the quotient rule on an diagram. Total percentage of larger hexagon is 350. Solidity percentage, that comes from keeping angles under construction such that your hexagon fits inside mid points of each hexagon and fits bottom edge 450 midpoints of second hexagon sector fit inside bottom edge of each hexagon which is odd firm midpoint rule type hering count basis.
