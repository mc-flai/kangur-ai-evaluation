Reasoning: The Mathematical Kangaroo takes place each year on the third Thursday of March. To find the latest possible date, we need to determine the date that falls on the third Thursday closest to the end of March in any given year. The calendar for the year in question is not provided, so we assume a typical year with 28 or 29 days in February. In the month of March, the first Thursday will always be on the 1st, 8th, 15th, or 22nd. Since we are looking for the third Thursday, it would be the 15th or the 22nd of March. However, considering the constraint that it must be on the third Thursday, we conclude that the latest possible date for the competition is March 22nd.
