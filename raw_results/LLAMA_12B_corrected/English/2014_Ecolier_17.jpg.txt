Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the given information and use it to find the number of kangoo-weeks in a quarter of a kangoo-year. Given: * Each kangoo-year has 20 kangoo-months. * Each kangoo-month has 6 kangoo-weeks. First, let's calculate the total number of kangoo-weeks in a kangoo-year: Total kangoo-weeks in a kangoo-year = kangoo-weeks/month x kangoo-months/year. Since each kangoo-month has 6 kangoo-weeks, we substitute the values: Total kangoo-weeks in a kangoo-year = 6 kangoo-weeks/month x 20 kangoo-months/year. Total kangoo-weeks in a kangoo-year = 120 kangoo-weeks/year. Now, we want to find out how many kangoo-weeks are in a quarter of a kangoo-year: Kangoo-weeks in a quarter of a kangoo-year = Total kangoo-weeks/year / 4. Kangoo-weeks in a quarter of a kangoo-year = 120 kangoo-weeks/year / 4. Kangoo-weeks in a quarter of a kangoo-year = 30 kangoo-weeks. Therefore, there are 30 kangoo-weeks in a quarter of a kangoo-year.

Answer: B) 30
