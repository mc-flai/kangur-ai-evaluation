Reasoning: To answer question 4, we need to understand the relationship between the time it takes for Ana to light each candle and the total number of candles. The question states that Ana starts lighting a candle every 10 minutes and that each candle lasts 40 minutes. After 55 minutes, how many candles will be lit? If Ana starts lighting a candle every 10 minutes, the first candle will be lit after 10 minutes. The second candle will be lit after another 10 minutes, for a total of 20 minutes. The third candle will be lit after another 10 minutes, for a total of 30 minutes. The fourth candle will be lit after another 10 minutes, for a total of 40 minutes. At this point, all four candles will be lit, and the fifth candle will be lit after another 10 minutes, bringing the total time to 50 minutes. Since each candle lasts 40 minutes, the fourth candle will still be lit at this point. Therefore, after 55 minutes, there will be four lit candles.
