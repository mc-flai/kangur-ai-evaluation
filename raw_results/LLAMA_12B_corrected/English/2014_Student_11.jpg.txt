**Reasoning:**
To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of a cuboid-shaped box. A cuboid has six rectangular faces, and each face has an area equal to the product of its two adjacent dimensions. When we analyze how volume changes when one dimension of a cuboid is increased while the other two dimensions remain constant, it's clear that the increase is not linear but rather based on the ratio of the changed dimension to the others. However, since the total face area and thus the ability to measure translates to volume changes proportionally with dimension lengths.

Let's consider each option:

A) If one increases a
When you increase just one dimension (in this case, 'a'), the volume increases. However, the rate of increase depends on how much each dimension is increased relative to the others. Increasing one dimension increases the surface area and volume, but the percentage increase in volume might not be directly proportional to the increase in dimension if other dimensions remain constant.

B) If one increases b
Similar to option A, if you increase dimension 'b', the volume also increases. Again, the rate of increase depends on the relationship between the scaled dimension and the constant dimensions.

C) If one increases c
Just like with options A and B, if you increase dimension 'c', the volume will increase. The factor by which the volume increases depends on the ratios of the dimensions.

D) The answer is depending on the values of a, b, and c.
This option suggests that the relationship between the increase in volume and an increase in any one dimension ('a', 'b', or 'c') could vary based on initial conditions, but it does not provide enough context to determine a single correct answer without knowing specific initial conditions.

E) The volume increases in the cases (A), (B), and (C) by an equal amount.
Given that a cuboid's volume (V) is calculated as V = a × b × c, increasing any one dimension means that the product of all three dimensions increases, assuming the other two do not change. Therefore, the percentage increase in volume due to an increase in any one dimension would be the same if all other conditions remain constant, especially in terms of proportional scaling.
