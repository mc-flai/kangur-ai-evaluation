Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze each option by identifying the regions that show the same pattern on all their faces. This will help us find the common pattern on all faces. 

**Option Analysis:**

* **Option A:** There are two white unit cubes adjacent to a black square and one black unit cube in between them. This pattern is repeated in multiple regions.
* **Option B:** Similar to Option A, with two white unit cubes adjacent to a black square and one black unit cube in between them. This pattern is consistent across regions.
* **Option C:** In this case, there are two black unit cubes adjacent to a white square and one white unit cube in between them. This pattern is seen in many regions.
* **Option D:** This option does not match any single correct answer as the description does not specify a common pattern for all regions.
* **Option E:** This option also does not match any single correct answer due to the lack of a specified common pattern.

**Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, options (A) and (B) share a common pattern. Therefore, the correct answer is **both A and B**.
