Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the given problem and understand what is being asked. The question asks about the nets of a cube with a line drawn on them. We are looking for the net where the line forms a closed loop when the cube is folded up. A net of a cube is a two-dimensional representation of the cube, showing its faces and edges. There are several different ways to fold a cube to create a net. Each net should have a line drawn on it, as mentioned in the problem. Once the line is drawn on each net, we need to fold the net back into a three-dimensional cube. After folding each net into a cube, we need to see if the line forms a closed loop on any of the nets. Let's analyze each net: (A): The line in net A does not form a closed loop when folded up. (B): The line in net B also does not form a closed loop when folded up. (C): The line in net C does not form a closed loop when folded up. (D): The line in net D forms a closed loop when folded up. (E): The line in net E does not form a closed loop when folded up. Based on the analysis, we can see that only one net (D) forms a closed loop when folded up. To obtain a cube looped by a line, one must choose (D).

Answer: D)
