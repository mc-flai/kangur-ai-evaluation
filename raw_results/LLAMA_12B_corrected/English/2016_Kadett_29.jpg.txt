Reasoning:

To solve this problem, let's consider the constraints given:

1. Every carriage of the train must have at least one passenger.
2. Two passengers are said to be neighboring if they are in the same carriage or in two successive carriages.
3. Each passenger can either have exactly 5 or exactly 10 neighbors.

Let's denote the number of passengers in each carriage as P1, P2, ..., Pn, where n is the total number of carriages.

Since every carriage has at least one passenger, the minimum number of passengers in the train is the number of carriages multiplied by 1 (for the minimum requirement in each carriage). However, since each passenger can have exactly 5 or 10 neighbors, and given the constraint about neighboring passengers, not all carriages can have just 1 passenger because that would not satisfy the neighbor requirement for most passengers.

To maximize the number of passengers while meeting the conditions:

- If any carriage has only 1 passenger, it contradicts the condition that each passenger should have exactly 5 or 10 neighbors because that wouldn't work out evenly across all passengers considering they need to be in the same carriage or in two successive carriages to neighbor.
  
- The only way to evenly distribute passengers to either have 5 or 10 neighbors while satisfying the condition that two passengers can be neighboring if they're in the same carriage or in two successive carriages is by ensuring each carriage has at least the minimum necessary so that all passengers can have either 5 or 10 neighbors.

Given these constraints, let's analyze the options:

- (A) states there are 13 passengers. This seems low because it doesn't comfortably allow for even distribution where each passenger has either 5 or 10 neighbors without at least some carriages having more than one passenger.
  
- (B) suggests 15 passengers. Similar to (A), it's low to accommodate loading conditions with enough carriages to make each passenger compatible with having 5 or 10 neighbors.

- (C) offers 17 passengers. With 17 passengers divided among possibly 3 or 4 carriages, it becomes feasible to arrange the passengers in such a way that all comply with having either 5 or 10 neighbors, considering the definition of neighbors.

- (D) proposes 20 passengers, which seems too high given the constraints about neighbor requirements. Most passengers would need at least 2 carriages where this could work out perfectly, leaning against option (C) as a better capacity management.
