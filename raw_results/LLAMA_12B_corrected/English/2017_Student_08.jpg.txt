Reasoning: **Step 1: Identify the equation of the graph** The given equation is f(x) = -3.5x + 7. This is a linear equation, and its graph will be a straight line. **Step 2: Determine the y-intercept and slope from the equation** To graph a linear equation, we need to know two points on the line. The y-intercept (where x=0) can be found by plugging x=0 into the equation: f(0) = -3.5(0) + 7 = 7 The slope (m) of the line can be found by looking at the coefficient of x in the equation. In this case, m = -3.5. **Step 3: Use the slope and y-intercept to plot the graph** With the y-intercept and slope known, we can plot the graph on a coordinate plane. The x-axis represents the independent variable (x), and the y-axis represents the dependent variable (f(x)). Plotting two points will confirm that they are on the line: when x=0, f(x)=7, so one point is (0,7); when x=1, f(x)=-5, so another point is (1,-5). **Step 4: Determine which of the given options contains no points of the graph of the linear function** Since the line extends to infinity in either direction, and we are looking for options that "contain no points of the graph," we consider the linear function's behavior across its domain: every point (x, f(x)) will be on the line -3.5x + 7. There is no value of x that will make f(x) equal to any other value -3.5 times any number plus 7, because those values exist at one of the other linear equations akan be equidistantly spaced because of the gravity in equation $clean//clean/formal.
