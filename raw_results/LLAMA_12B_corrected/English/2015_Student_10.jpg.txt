Reasoning: To determine the number of holes on the inner area of the folded paper, we need to understand how the fold affects the square's structure. The original square has no holes. When one corner is cut off and the paper is unfolded, it creates a single hole. If we fold the square in order and direction as shown in the image, each fold will create a new hole. There are 3 folds in total (from the front view), leading to **3** additional holes. Therefore, the total number of holes is **1** (from the corner cut-off) + **3** (from the folds) = **4**.
