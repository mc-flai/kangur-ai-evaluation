**Reasoning:**

To find the smallest possible weight of the heaviest coin, we need to consider how the different weights can be made with eight coins. Since the question specifies that the weights are all different positive integers in grams, we know that the weights must be consecutive integers starting from one gram.

Let's consider the case where the heaviest coin weighs $w$ grams. Since there are eight coins and each coin must weigh a different amount, the lightest coin would weigh $(w-7)$ grams.

According to the given statement, the side containing any two coins on one side of a balance scale and any two on the other side of the balance scales, the side containing the heaviest of the four coins is always the heavier side. This means that the heaviest coin must be 7 times heavier than the lightest coin.

We can express this relationship as an equation:

$w = 7(w-7)$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$w = 7w - 49$

Subtracting $7w$ from both sides gives:

$-6w = -49$

Dividing by -6, we find:

$w = 8.1666...$ grams

Since the weights must be whole numbers, the rounded-down integer part of this value is the minimum possible weight for the heaviest coin. Therefore, the smallest possible weight of the heaviest coin is 8 grams.
