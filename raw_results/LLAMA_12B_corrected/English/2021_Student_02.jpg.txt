Reasoning: **Step 1: Understand the given interval.** The given interval is (20-√21;20+√21). **Step 2: Determine the integers in the interval.** To find the integers in the interval, we need to consider the values of the lower and upper limits. **Step 3: Evaluate the lower limit.** The lower limit is 20-√21. We need to find the largest integer less than or equal to this value. **Step 4: Evaluate the upper limit.** The upper limit is 20+√21. We need to find the smallest integer greater than or equal to this value. **Step 5: Identify the integers in the interval.** The largest integer less than or equal to 20-√21 is 10 and the smallest integer greater than or equal to 20+√21 is 13. **Step 6: List the integers in the interval.** The integers in the interval are 11 and 12. 
Answer: C) 11 12
