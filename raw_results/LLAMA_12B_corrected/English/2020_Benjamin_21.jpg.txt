Reasoning: To find the area of the gray square, we can use the fact that the white squares have sides parallel to the sides of the gray square. Let's denote the side length of the gray square as x.

The total area of the gray square is given by:

Area of gray square = area of large white square + 4 times the area of small white squares
= (9^2) + 4*(4^2)
= 81 + 64
= 145
