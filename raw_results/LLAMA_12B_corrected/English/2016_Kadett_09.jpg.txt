Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of angles and their relationships in a quadrilateral. We are given a quadrilateral $ABCD$ with certain angle properties and asked to find the sum of the interior angles of this quadrilateral. The given information is that: * angle $A$ is 70 degrees * angle $B$ is 80 degrees * angle $C$ is 110 degrees. We can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360 degrees to find the sum of the interior angles of this quadrilateral. Let's denote the unknown angle $D$ as $x$. We know that the sum of all interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees. Therefore, we can set up an equation: $$A + B + C + D = 360$$ Substituting the given values, we get: $$70 + 80 + 110 + D = 360$$ Simplifying the equation, we get: $$D = 360 - 260$$ $$D = 100$$ So, the angle $D$ is 100 degrees. However, this does not satisfy the problem statement as it does not match any of the options provided when considered on its own. It seems there might have been a mistake in understanding the problem or the initial setup. Given the usual approach to such questions, it seems there was an oversight in directly computing the requested third angle based on the initial setup. Usually, one would use the properties of angles in a quadrilateral, such as the fact that the angles around a point add up to 360 degrees or that opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal, to deduce the value of the missing angle without directly calculating it as done here. The resolution lies in correctly interpreting how the angles are described and how they relate, typically leveraging specific geometric properties beyond what occurred in the explanation. Apologies for the confusion. The correct approach necessitates understanding the angles' relations and possibly reconsidering the geometric configuration, emphasizing the importance of adhering to geometric principles and accurately interpreting the scenario's specifics. Given the context provided and following the path indicated: The correct answer should reflect the correct application and understanding of geometric principles relevant to the description of angles within the given figure or scenario. Regrettably, the explanation didn't adhere to the principles in a manner conducive to reaching a solution based solely on the information provided and typical geometric criteria usually applied in such scenarios.
