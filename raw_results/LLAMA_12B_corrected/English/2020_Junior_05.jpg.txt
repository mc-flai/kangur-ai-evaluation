Reasoning: To solve question 5, we need to understand the properties of squares and triangles. A square is a type of regular polygon with four sides of equal length, where all internal angles are right angles (90 degrees). A triangle, on the other hand, is a polygon with three sides. First, let's analyze the options provided: (A) 3: This represents a triangle, not a square. (B) 4: This represents a square. (C) 5: This cannot represent either a square or a triangle because it is greater than 4, which is the maximum number of vertices for a square. (D) 6: This cannot represent either a square or a triangle because it is greater than 4, which is the maximum number of vertices for a square. (E) 7: This cannot represent either a square or a triangle because it is greater than 4, which is the maximum number of vertices for a square. Based on the given information and the properties of squares and triangles, the correct answer is:

Answer: B)
