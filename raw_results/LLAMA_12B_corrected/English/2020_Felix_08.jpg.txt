Reasoning: To answer this question, we need to analyze the given options and determine which one represents a drawing that has fewer squares than triangles.

**Analyzing Option A**

*   Shapes in Option A: 4 squares and 4 triangles
*   Conclusion: This option does not meet the criteria for having fewer squares than triangles.

**Analyzing Option B**

*   Shapes in Option B: 2 squares and 4 triangles
*   Conclusion: This option also does not meet the criteria.

**Analyzing Option C**

*   Shapes in Option C: 3 squares and 4 triangles
*   Conclusion: Again, this option does not meet the criteria.

**Analyzing Option D**

*   Shapes in Option D: 4 squares and 3 triangles
*   Conclusion: This option also does not meet the criteria.

**Analyzing Option E**

*   Shapes in Option E: 1 square and 4 triangles
*   Conclusion: This option indeed has fewer squares than triangles.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, only option E meets the condition of having fewer squares than triangles. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: E)
