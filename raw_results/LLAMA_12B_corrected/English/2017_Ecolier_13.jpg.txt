Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of divisors and how they relate to finding the smallest number that can be divided evenly by other numbers. The problem states that 13 children are registered for a competition, and then another 19 joined. Six equally big teams are needed for the competition. We need to find out how many more children are needed so that six equally big teams can be formed. To form six equally big teams, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers of children in each team. Since we don't know the exact number of children in each team, we can start by finding the LCM of 13 and 19. The LCM of 13 and 19 is 247. So, we need to find the number of children required so that six teams can be formed with the same number of children in each team, and that number is divisible by 6. Let's calculate the total number of children required for four teams and then add 2 to get the total number of children required for six teams: \[13 + 19 = 32\] Divide 32 by 4: \[32 / 4 = 8\] Since 8 children are already present, we need to add 2 to get a total of 10 children per team, which can be divided into six teams evenly: \[8 + 2 = 10\] Now, we have 32 children in total, but we need 6 teams of 10 children each. So, we subtract 32 from 60 (6 * 10) to find the additional requirements: \[60 - 32 = 28\] The correct answer is **E) 5**. Therefore, we need 5 more children so that six equally big teams can be formed.
