Reasoning: To solve question 28, we need to find the possible value of n + p, where n is the number we choose and p is the sum of all positive whole numbers from 1 to n. The key concept here is that a prime number p divides this sum but none of the small sums. Let's break it down step by step: 1. The sum of all positive whole numbers from 1 to n can be calculated using the formula: sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2. 2. If a prime number p divides this sum, then p must also divide (n * (n + 1)) / 2. 3. Since p is a prime number, it can only divide the sum if it also divides n or n + 1. However, if p divides n, then it would also divide the sum of all positive whole numbers from 1 to n, which is not the case according to the problem statement. 4. Therefore, p must divide n + 1. This means n + 1 must be a multiple of p. Looking at the options: A) 217 = 7 * 31 B) 221 = 13 * 17 C) 229 = 11 * 169 (both are prime numbers) D) 245 = 5 * 7 * 7 (not a prime number) E) 269 = 269 (prime number) Based on our analysis, both 229 and 269 are prime numbers, which means they could potentially satisfy the condition of having a prime number p divide their sum. Therefore, the correct answer is C) 229 and E) 269.
