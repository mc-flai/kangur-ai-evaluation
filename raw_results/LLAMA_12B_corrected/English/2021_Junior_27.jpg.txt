Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the pattern of cell painting in the 4 × 4 table. The problem states that in the 4 × 4 table, some cells must be painted black. The numbers next to and below the table show how many cells in that row or column must be black. The key is to understand how the constraints influence the possible arrangements: In the first column, there are two cells that must be black, which leaves us with the flexible arrangement of the other two cells in this column since at least two must be black. For the second column, there are also two cells that must be black, presenting a similar flexibility in arrangement. The third column promises one painted cell, providing more flexibility. The fourth and fifth columns each require one cell to be painted, offering minimal flexibility due to their singular constraint. Given these constraints, the main considerations are arranging flexible spots in a way that respects the minimal requirements across columns and rows while maximizing the number of potential configurations: For rows 1-2, where two cells must be painted in the first column, 3 arrangements are possible. For column 2, where two cells must be painted, 3 arrangements are possible. For column 3, where one cell must be painted, the number of arrangements increases because now you partition the three available spots. Assuming independent choices when deciding which cells to paint based on the given constraints: There are 3 choices for column 1 (as two cells must be black, and there are 4 spots initially). 3 choices for column 2 (as exactly two cells must be black, leaving options for which cells in that column). All possible combinations for column 3 (as there's a variety of ways to partition the 3 spots offered) will depend on the total number calculated assuming two spots are taken in column 4.
