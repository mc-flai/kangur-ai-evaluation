Reasoning: To solve question 12, we need to analyze the information given and apply logical reasoning. The problem statement mentions four smudges hiding behind four numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and provides the following calculations: – 1 + 3 = 4 – 2 + 4 = 6 – 3 + 5 = 8. Since two equations result in 4 and none in 5 or 8, the smudge behind the number 4 must be the lion's location. Therefore, the correct answer is option D), 4.

Answer: D)
