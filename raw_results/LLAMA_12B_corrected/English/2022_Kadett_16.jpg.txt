Reasoning: To determine the area of the square flowerbed where the sunflowers are planted, we need to look at the provided diagram. The diagram shows a square with side length 12 meters, and within this square, there is an image of a flowerbed with tulips and sunflowers. However, the actual size of the flowerbed is not directly given in the question. Instead, we are asked to choose from different options for the area of the flowerbed based on its size being given. Looking at the options provided: (A) 36 m^2, (B) 40 m^2, (C) 44 m^2, (D) 46 m^2, (E) 48 m^2. We also notice a statement at the bottom of the question: "There are two clocks in my office. One of which is one minute fast every hour, and the other one is two minutes slow every hour." This statement seems unrelated to the calculation of the area but might be intended to distract or confuse the reader. Therefore, it's best to ignore it when determining the correct answer. Given that no specific area is provided for the flowerbed in the question, we cannot accurately determine the correct answer unless more specific information about the flowerbed's size is given. Without this additional information, we must select an answer based on the options provided, despite the lack of direct evidence in the question to support any one answer.

Answer: No Answer.
