Reasoning: **Step 1: Calculate the time it takes for the second messenger to arrive at the castle after the first messenger, considering the distance to be equal to the difference in time traveled by the two messengers.** The castle is 5 km away from the king's residence. If the differential speed between the two messengers is 10 km/h - 5 km/h = 5 km/h, it would take 1 hour for the second messenger to arrive. **Step 2: Convert the time into minutes using the formula Time*60 to get the minutes.** 1 hour = 60 minutes **Step 3: Determine which of the given options matches the time calculated in Step 2.** Options (C) 75 min and (E) 120 min are both closed after adding 1 hour to the options (B) 60 min and (D) 90 min. However, we need to find which option falls exactly at 90 minutes. **Conclusion:** Therefore, **Option (D) 90 minutes** is the correct answer.

Answer: D
