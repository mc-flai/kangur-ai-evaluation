Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to simplify the expression and match it with one of the given options.

Given expression:
\[\sqrt{(2015 + 2015) + (2015 - 2015) + (2015 \times 2015) + (2015  \div 2015)} = \sqrt{2015}\]

We can simplify the expression inside the square root:

*   \[(2015 + 2015) = 4025\]
*   \[(2015 - 2015) = 0\]
*   \[(2015 \times 2015) = 4080625\]
*   \[(2015  \div 2015) = 1\]

Adding these values together:

\[4025 + 0 + 4080625 + 1 = 4086651\]

Taking the square root of this result:

\[\sqrt{4086651} â‰ˆ 2015\]

Therefore, the simplified expression matches option (A). So, the correct answer is: This expression simplifies to the square root of a perfect square, which is the number under the square root.
