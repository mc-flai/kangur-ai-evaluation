Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the pattern of multiplication in the multiplication pyramid. The given pyramid is a geometric representation of the process of multiplication, where each number at a higher level is the result of multiplying the corresponding numbers at the previous level.

**Step 1: Identify the Values in the Pyramid**

Looking at the pyramid, we can see that:

- The first row represents the numbers 0 and 1.
- The second row represents the numbers 2.
- The third row represents the numbers 4 and 8.
- The fourth row represents the number 16.

**Step 2: Calculate the Next Number**

Following the pattern, to find the next number in the pyramid after 8, we continue the multiplication process:

- Each number in the pyramid is calculated by taking one number from the row above and multiplying it by the next number to its right.

**Step 3: Determine the Pattern**

Given the pyramid's pattern, to get 16, we multiply 4 (from the third row) by 2 (from the second row). To find the next number in the fourth row, we would multiply the current rightmost number in the third row (4) by the rightmost number in the second row (2).

**Step 4: Find the Correct Answer**

Therefore, to get the next number after 16, we need to follow the pattern and multiply 8 (from the third row) by 2 (from the second row). 

Answer: D) 8.
