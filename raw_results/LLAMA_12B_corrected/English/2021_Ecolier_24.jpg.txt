Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of balanced scales and how different objects of different weights balance each other. The question states that Martin has 3 different types of objects: hexagons, squares, and triangles. Each object has a certain weight associated with it. However, the specific weights are not provided in the question. There are two sets of scales shown in the image. Each set has two scales with an object placed on each side. The goal is to balance the scales by placing objects on the left-hand side of the third set of scales. For the scales to be balanced, the total weight of the objects on one side must equal the total weight of the objects on the other side. We can use this principle to determine which objects need to be placed on the left-hand side of the third set of scales. Looking at the options provided, we can eliminate them based on the principle of balance: (A) 1 square, (B) 2 squares, (C) 1 hexagon, (D) 1 triangle, (E) 2 triangles. Since the specific weights of the objects are not provided, we cannot directly calculate the weights of each option. However, we can make an educated guess based on the fact that hexagons are mentioned first in the instructions, suggesting they might have a significant weight. Based on the information given and the principle of balance, the correct answer is: (C) 1 hexagon. This option is chosen because hexagons are mentioned first in the instructions, implying they might have a significant weight. Placing 1 hexagon on one side of the third set of scales will likely balance it with receiving objects of the same total weight, as indicated in the problem statement by the placement of 1 triangle on the other side. The reasoning behind choosing option C is based on the assumption that the problem is designed to test the application of the principle of balance using visual representations. The mention of hexagons first in the instructions suggests they might carry more weight, making option C the most plausible solution.

Answer: C)
