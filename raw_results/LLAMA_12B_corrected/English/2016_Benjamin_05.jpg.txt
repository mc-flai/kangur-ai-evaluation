Reasoning: To find the area of the smaller square, we need to find the side length of the smaller square. We know that the side length of the larger square is 10 cm and that it is divided into four equal parts when Kathi joins the midpoints of each side. When she joins these midpoints, she effectively divides each side into two equal parts. Therefore, the side length of the smaller square will be half the side length of the larger square. Side length of larger square = 10 cm. Side length of smaller square = Half of side length of larger square. Side length of smaller square = 10 / 2 = 5 cm. Now that we have the side length of the smaller square, we can find its area using the formula: Area of square = (Side length) ^ 2. Area of smaller square = (5) ^ 2. Area of smaller square = 25 cm^2. Therefore, the area of the smaller square is 25 cm^2. The thought process here involved understanding the relationship between the side lengths of the two squares and how dividing the larger square into four equal parts affects its side length. Once we had the side length of the smaller square, we could easily calculate its area using the formula for the area of a square.

Answer: C) 25 cm^2
