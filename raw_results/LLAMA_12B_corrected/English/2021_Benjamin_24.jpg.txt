Reasoning: To determine which pieces of fruit are the heaviest, we must compare their weights. We are provided with a table describing the weights of an apple and an orange relative to the weights of a pear and a peach. Pears weigh less than apples and oranges. Peaches weigh less than apples and oranges. An apple weighs more than a pear. An orange weighs more than a peach. The process of elimination can be used to identify the heaviest fruit. Relate apple and orange to pear and peach. Determine that an orange weighs more than a peach. The heaviest fruit is the one weighing more than 1 peach. Apple: more than a pear but less than 1 peach. Orange: more than 1 peach.

Answer: No Answer.
