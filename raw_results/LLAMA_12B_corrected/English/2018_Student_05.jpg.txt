Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of parity and its application in combinatorial problems. We have 12 dice, and an object made of 12 dice is glued together. The goal is to find how many of the small dice will have exactly four faces colored in. The key concept here is the parity of the number of faces colored on each small dice, given that the entire outside of the object is colored. Since each small dice can either have an odd or even number of faces colored (since it's either a solid color or not), we're looking for a configuration where exactly four faces are colored. Suppose the central dice (the one not glued to the others) has an even number of faces colored (let's say 0, 2, or 4). For any small dice adjacent to the central dice, if they have an odd number of faces colored (1 or 3), adding that to the even number of faces colored on the central dice results in an odd sum, implying there's a set of colors for each small dice such that their sums are odd. If an odd number of small dice is chosen, the total faces colored sum to an odd number because the central dice contributes an even number. However, if we select an even number of small dice including the central dice, their total faces colored sum to an even number since the central dice contributes an even number and all other selected small dice individually have an even number of faces colored (which doesn't change the fact that the sum is even). Given the above analysis, the only configuration that would allow exactly four faces of the small dice to be colored and satisfy the condition for all dice (as we dekive through logical reasoning such as left-right symmetry identified from shapes notaneously pleasing) is option (A) 8. Based on our reasoning, the correct answer is (A) 8.
