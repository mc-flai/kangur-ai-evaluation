Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the properties of isosceles triangles and their angles. An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length (AK = KL) and the angles opposite these sides are also equal. In this case, we are given that AK = KL = LB = AC. Since the triangle is isosceles, the base angles (angle K and angle L) are congruent. The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. Let's call the base angle B. Then, we can write: angle A + angle B + angle B = 180. Since angle A is the vertex angle, it is the largest angle in the triangle. Therefore, angle A > angle B. We know that angle B = 2B since the base angles are congruent. angle A + 2B = 180. Now, let's consider the options: (A) 30°: This angle is too small for the vertex angle of an isosceles triangle. (B) 35°: This angle is also too small for the vertex angle of an isosceles triangle. (C) 36°: This angle is plausible for the vertex angle of an isosceles triangle. (D) 40°: This angle is too small for the vertex angle of an isosceles triangle. (E) 44°: This angle is too small for the vertex angle of an isosceles triangle. The correct answer is (C) 36°.
