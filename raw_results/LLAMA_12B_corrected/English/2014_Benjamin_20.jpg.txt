Reasoning: To determine which song Andy is playing when he returns one hour later, we need to find the shortest song. Solving the equation |5 minutes| + |30s| + |1 minute| + |30 minutes| + |4 minutes| = 1 hour (60 minutes), we get |5| + |30| + |1| + |30| + |4| = 1 which simplifies to 5 + 30 + 1 + 30 + 4 = 70 minutes. Substituting in the values we have 5 minutes + 30 seconds + 1 minute + 30 minutes + 4 minutes = 1 hour. Comparing this to the answers provided for question 20, we have the following: (20) Song Durations A. 3 minutes, 3 minutes, 4 minutes, 1 minute, 4 minutes B. 3 minutes, 2 minutes, 1 minute, 30 seconds, 2 minutes C. 4 minutes, 3 minutes, 3 minutes, 30 seconds, 1 minute D. 1 minute, 4 minutes, 4 minutes, 1 minute, 30 seconds E. 30 seconds, 6 minutes, 1 minute, 1 minute, 2 minutes Our solution to question 20 is answer (B).
