Reasoning: **Step 1: Understand the problem**

The question asks which of the given numbers can be the product of two positive integers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ such that their equality is satisfied for a given equation.

**Step 2: Solve the equation**

Calculate the product of the first pair:

$$
\begin{aligned}
abc &= 50 \\
ab &= 5 \cdot 10 \\
a &= 5, b = 10 \tag{1}
\end{aligned}
$$

or

$$
\begin{aligned}
abc &= 50 \\
ab &= 10 \cdot 5 \\
a &= 10, b = 5 \tag{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

The possible values for $abc$ are combinations of $(1)$ and $(2)$.

Calculate the product of the second pair:

$$
\begin{aligned}
bcd &= 150 \\
bc &= 3 \cdot 50 \\
b &= 3, c = 50 \tag{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

or

$$
\begin{aligned}
bcd &= 150 \\
bc &= 5 \cdot 30 \\
b &= 5, c = 30 \tag{4}
\end{aligned}
$$

The possible values for $bcd$ are combinations of $(3)$ and $(4)$.

Calculate the product of the last pair:

$$
\begin{aligned}
cdc &= 3cd \\
3cd &= 250 \\
cd &= 250/3 \\
c &= 2, d = 125 \\
c &= \frac{2}{3}, d = \frac{125}{6} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, only the product $250$ can be the $abcd$ product.

The final answer is *D) 250*.
