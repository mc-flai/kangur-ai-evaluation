Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the distribution of the numbers on the eight cards and determine how many envelopes can be chosen by Eva. The numbers 1 through 8 are each marked on an unmarked envelope. Ali takes the remaining ones. We can calculate that there are 128 - 8 = 120 numbers left after removing the numbers 1 through 8. To find the number of envelopes that Eva can choose, we need to count how many different combinations of numbers she can get. Since Eva only chooses some of these eight envelopes, we will use the combination formula to calculate this: C(n, k) = n!/((n-k)! * k!) where n is the total number of items (in this case, 120), k is the number of items to choose (in this case, 8), and "!" denotes factorial. Using this formula, we get: C(120, 8) = 120!/((120-8)! * 8!) = 120!/112!/8! = (120 * 119 * ... * 113 * 112 * 111 * ... * 104 * 8 * 7 * 6 * ... * 1) / (8 * 7 * ... * 1) = 7,130,790,077,358,905,848. This is a very large number, indicating that there are indeed many possible combinations of envelopes that Eva can choose.
