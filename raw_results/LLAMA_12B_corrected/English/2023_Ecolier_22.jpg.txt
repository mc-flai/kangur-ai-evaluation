Reasoning: To answer this question, we need to understand the process of inserting a square piece of paper into machines R and S to produce a specific image. The first step is to put a square piece of paper into machine R if it is rotated. This means that if the square piece of paper undergoes a rotation when it is fed into machine R, it will be converted into a different shape or form. The second step is to put the piece of paper in machine S if it is printed on. This implies that if the square piece of paper is printed on when it is fed into machine S, it will be transformed into a different image or design. Now, let's analyze the options provided: (A) SRR - This sequence suggests that the square piece of paper is first rotated in machine R and then rotated again in machine R. This would not produce a new image, as the rotation is performed twice in the same machine. (B) RSR - This sequence indicates that the square piece of paper is first rotated in machine R, then rotated again in machine R, and finally rotated in machine S. Since the second rotation in machine R is followed by a rotation in machine S, which prints the paper, it will not result in the desired image. (C) RSS - This sequence assumes that the square piece of paper is first rotated in machine R, then fed into machine S for printing, and finally rotated again in machine S. However, the rotation in machine S does not complement the previous two operations, leading to an incorrect image. (D) SRS - This sequence implies that the square piece of paper is first fed into machine S for printing, then rotated in machine R, and finally rotated again in machine S. Although this sequence involves a rotation in machine S, it does not complement the previous operations correctly. (E) SRS - This sequence, although similar to option (D), implies that the square piece of paper is first fed into machine S for printing, then rotated in machine S, and finally passed through machine R without any operation. This sequence correctly aligns with the provided instructions, as it combines printing in machine S with a rotation, resulting in the desired image. In conclusion, the correct sequence to produce the desired image is SRS, making option (E) the correct answer.
