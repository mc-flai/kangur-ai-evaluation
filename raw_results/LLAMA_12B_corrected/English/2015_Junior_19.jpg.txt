Reasoning: 

To solve this problem, we need to find three-digit positive whole numbers where the digits always differ by 3.

We can start by listing out some possible combinations of digits that meet this condition:

- (0, 3, 6) or (3, 6, 9) are the only possible combinations where the difference is always 3.
- The hundreds digit can be any of these combinations, but the tens and ones digits must follow suit accordingly.
- For example, if we choose (3, 6, 9) as the base combination, the possible numbers are: 396, 399, 693, 696, 996.

Now, let's examine the answer choices:

- A) 12: The difference between 1 and 2 is 1, not 3.
- B) 14: The difference between 1 and 4 is 3, but this doesn't meet the repeating pattern requirement.
- C) 16: The difference between 1 and 6 is 5, not 3.
- D) 20: The difference between 2 and 0 is 2, not 3.
- E) 27: The difference between 2 and 7 is not exactly 3, as it's either too high or too low depending on the specific digit chosen from the base combination.

Based on our analysis, none of the given options (A, B, C, D, or E) perfectly match the requirement of having digits that always differ by 3. Therefore, there are no correct answers among the given options.
