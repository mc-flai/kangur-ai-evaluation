Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the area of square paper and how it relates to right-angled triangles and squares. The diagram provided shows that Wanda cuts each of the pages into right-angled triangles and squares. We are asked to find the area of the shape formed by the right-hand diagram. Step 1: Identify the number of squares and right-angled triangles in the shape. From the diagram, we can see that there is one square with an area of 4 units and two right-angled triangles with areas of 3 units and 2 units, respectively. Step 2: Calculate the total area of the shape. To find the total area, we add the areas of the square and the right-angled triangles: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 units. Step 3: Match the calculated area with the given options. Option (C) corresponds to the calculated area of 9/2 units. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C)
