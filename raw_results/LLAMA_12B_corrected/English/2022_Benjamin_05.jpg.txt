Reasoning: The problem states that marbles are sold in packages of 5, 10, or 25 and Tom buys exactly 95 marbles. We need to find the minimum number of packages Tom has to buy. We are given five options: A) 4, B) 5, C) 7, D) 8, and E) 10. We need to determine which option is the minimum number of packages Tom has to buy. Let's calculate the total number of marbles for each option: Option A) 4 packages of 5 marbles each: 4 x 5 = 20 marbles; Option B) 5 packages of 5 marbles each: 5 x 5 = 25 marbles; Option C) 7 packages of 5 marbles each: 7 x 5 = 35 marbles; Option D) 8 packages of 5 marbles each: 8 x 5 = 40 marbles; Option E) 10 packages of 5 marbles each: 10 x 5 = 50 marbles. From the calculations above, we can see that option B) 5 packages of 5 marbles each gives us a total of 25 marbles, which is less than 95 marbles. However, we still need to purchase more marbles to reach 95 marbles. Let's calculate the remaining marbles after purchasing 5 packages of 5 marbles each: 95 - 25 = 70 marbles. Divide the remaining marbles by the number of marbles per package in the next smallest package size: 70 รท 10 = 7. So, we need to purchase 7 additional packages of 10 marbles each. Add the initial 5 packages to the additional 7 packages: 5 + 7 = 12. Therefore, the minimum number of packages Tom has to buy is 12 packages.
