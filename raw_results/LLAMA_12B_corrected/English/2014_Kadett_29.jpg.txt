Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the grid and its properties. The grid has 16 lilly pads and is arranged in a 4x4 pattern. Since the frog can only jump from one lily pad to another horizontally or vertically, it can cover a maximum of half of the grid in any given move. This means that after a single jump, the frog can be at most in the top-right or bottom-left corner of the grid. However, there's another way to look at it - the frog cannot ever be in the same spot twice because it must always land on a different lily pad than the one it starts from. Given these conditions, we can analyze the options: - **(A) 16**: If the frog starts in any corner of the grid and jumps from one lily pad to another horizontally or vertically, it will eventually cover the entire grid but cannot return to the starting point as per the conditions. - **(B) 14**: This option implies that the frog can visit only two-thirds of the lilly pads in total, as any other attempt to cover more than this portion of the grid would force the frog into the other corner. - **(C) 8**: This option suggests the frog can visit twenty-four places before it exhausts all available jumps. However, by dividing each dimension by two and testing all possible paths, we find that the best possible strategy gives us fewer options than what this guess implies. - **(D) 6**: By analyzing paths where the frog lands on the same spot once, the frog is able to find six related configurations that share the same number of options, confirming that this guess reaches the upper bound of what is possible. - **(E) 4**: While this option might initially seem plausible due to computational considerations, the hard proof by constructing paths ruled out the choice. As such, all four answer options that Holloway computed all were claimed to work.
