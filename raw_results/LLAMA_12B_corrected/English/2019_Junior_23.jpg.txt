Reasoning: The question asks about the net of an octahedron and which edge meets the edge labelled with x if the net is folded up to form an octahedron. There are nine edges in the diagram. They are labelled from 1 to 9, with x being one of them. The options provided are (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E). To determine the correct answer, we need to find the edge that meets the edge labelled with x when the net is folded up. When we fold the net up, we get an octahedron with eight triangular faces. Each face has three edges. The edges labelled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 form the sides of the octahedron. By analyzing the diagram, we can see that the edge labelled with x is part of the base of the octahedron. It meets three edges of the octahedron. The only edge that meets the edge labelled with x when the net is folded up is the one labelled as 4 on the right diagram.
