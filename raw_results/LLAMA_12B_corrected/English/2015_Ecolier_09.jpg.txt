Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of borrowing and lending. Luis initially has 7 apples and 2 bananas. He gives 2 apples to Jacob, which means he now has 5 apples. At the same time, Jacob receives 2 apples, bringing his total fruit count to 2 apples and 2 bananas. Afterwards, Luis gets the same amounts of apples as bananas. This means he gets an equal number of each fruit. Since he now has 5 apples, he will receive 5 bananas. Looking at the options: *   Option A) 2: This is incorrect because Luis gave away 2 apples, not received them. *   Option B) 3: This is correct because Luis received 5 apples and got the same number of bananas as apples. *   Option C) 4: This is incorrect because Luis did not receive any more bananas after giving away 2 apples. *   Option D) 5: This is incorrect because Luis received 5 apples, but the question asks how many bananas he got from Jacob. *   Option E) 7: This is incorrect because Luis gave away 2 apples, reducing his count to 5. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: B)
