Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the relationships between the weights of apples and bananas in the given options. The problem states that each of the 5 boxes contains either apples or bananas, but not both, and the total weight of all the bananas is three times the weight of all the apples. We are presented with five options: (A) 1 and 2, (B) 2 and 3, (C) 2 and 4, (D) 3 and 4, (E) 1 and 4. To determine which boxes contain apples, let's analyze the information provided: - Option (A) contains 1 and 2 kg. - Option (B) contains 2 and 3 kg. - Option (C) contains 2 and 4 kg. - Option (D) contains 3 and 4 kg. - Option (E) contains 1 and 4 kg. From the problem statement, we know that the total weight of all the bananas is three times the weight of all the apples. This implies that if there are two or four boxes of bananas, there must be three boxes of apples because 3 * A = 2B (for example). However, if there are three or six boxes of bananas mentioned in total, there should be one or three boxes of apples. Let's evaluate each option: Option (A) - Total weight of bananas could be 3 kg and apples could be 2 kg or more than 6 kg. Option (B) - Total weight of bananas could be 6 kg and apples could be 3 kg or four or more. Option (C) - Total weight of bananas could be 4 kg and apples could be 4 kg or three or more. Option (D) - Total weight of bananas could be 6 kg and apples could be 6 kg or five or more. Option (E) - Total is 5 kg of fruit, one box of what and 4 lighter boxes of the other. By analyzing the given options and considering the constraint provided in the problem statement, it is evident that only option (D) satisfies the condition that the total weight of all the bananas is three times the weight of all the apples perfectly.

Answer: D)
