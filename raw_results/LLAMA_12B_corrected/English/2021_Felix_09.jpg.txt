Reasoning: To determine how many pieces of the ribbon Edmund finished with, we need to analyze the diagram provided. Since Edmund cut the ribbon into 9 pieces as shown in the picture. Edmund's action of cutting the ribbon indicates that he divided it into equal parts. The total number of pieces can be calculated by adding 1 to the number of cuts (because each cut creates an additional piece). Therefore, he finished with 9 + 1 = 10 pieces of the ribbon.
