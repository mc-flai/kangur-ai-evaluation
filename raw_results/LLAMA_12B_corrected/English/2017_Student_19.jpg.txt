Reasoning: To find the length of side AD, we can use the information provided in the diagram and apply properties of equilateral and isosceles triangles. 1. The perimeter of an equilateral triangle with side length 5 is 15 units. 2. If you connect a point **D** to the endpoints **E** and **F** of a **BC** side, then **DFE** becomes an isosceles triangle with a perimeter of 19. 3. Therefore, the length of **AD** in the above diagram is $5 - 3 = \boxed{2}$.
