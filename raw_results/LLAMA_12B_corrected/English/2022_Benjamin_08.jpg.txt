Reasoning: **Step 1: Understand the question.** To determine which option represents the number of turns that a Ferris wheel needs to make in order for a white gondola to be on top for the first time, we need to understand how the numbers in the options are related to the flips of a coin. **Step 2: Analyze the given options.** The options are: (A) $\frac{1}{2}$ turn (B) $\frac{1}{3}$ turn (C) $\frac{1}{6}$ turn (D) $\frac{1}{12}$ turn (E) $\frac{5}{6}$ turn **Step 3: Choose the correct answer.** We want to find the number of flips required for the white gondola to land facing up. Since there are six gondolas and each has an equal probability of landing facing up or down, we can calculate the expected number of flips until the desired outcome occurs. Let's calculate the probability that the white gondola is on top after one flip: * With probability  $\frac{1}{6}$ , it lands facing up. * With probability  $\frac{5}{6}$ , it lands facing down. Now, let's calculate how many more flips are needed on average: * After the second flip, the probability that it has landed facing up is  $\frac{5}{6}$  *  $\frac{1}{6}$ * After the third flip, the probability that it has landed facing up is  $\frac{5}{6}$  * $\frac{5}{6}$  *  $\frac{1}{6}$ We can see that the probabilities follow a pattern, where each additional flip reduces the probability by a factor of  $\frac{5}{6}$ . To reach a probability of 1 (which represents certainty), we need reciprocals of powers of  $\frac{1}{6}$ ), specifically  $\frac{6}{1}$ ,  $\frac{36}{1}$ , and so on. This means that the options correspond to: * (A) The reciprocal of the sum of two consecutive numbers:  $\frac{1}{2}$  = 1/6 + 1/12 * (B) The reciprocal of the sum of three consecutive numbers:  $\frac{1}{3}$  = 1/6 + 2/12 * (C) The
