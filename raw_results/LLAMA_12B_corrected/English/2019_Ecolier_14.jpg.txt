Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to find the correct digits that Steven should write into the boxes such that they will use the single-digit numbers 0 or 1, only 0, only 1, or only 2. The addition problem is: 2 + 0 + 1 = ? We can see that if Steven writes 0 in the middle box, the sum will be 3, which cannot be expressed using only the digits 0 and 1. Therefore, Steven must write 1 in the middle box to ensure that the sum is an even number.

Answer: A)
