Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between addition and subtraction. Jim initially had a certain number. He then added 26 to this number and obtained -14 as the result.

Mathematically, we can represent this situation as follows:

Initial Number = x

After adding 26:
x + 26 = -14

To find the initial number, we can subtract 26 from both sides of the equation:

x = -14 - 26
x = -40

So, the initial number is -40.

Now, let's consider the options provided:

(A) 28
(B) 32
(C) 36
(D) 38
(E) 42

We need to determine which of these numbers, when added to the original number (-40), would result in -14.

Let's check each option:

(A) 28:
-40 + 28 = -12 (not -14)
(B) 32:
-40 + 32 = -8 (not -14)
(C) 36:
-40 + 36 = -4 (not -14)
(D) 38:
-40 + 38 = -2 (not -14)
(E) 42:
-40 + 42 = 2 (not -14)

None of the given options yield a result of -14 when added to the original number (-40).

However, if we look closely at the original calculation, adding 26 to -40 indeed results in -14, but subtracting 26 would give us -66 instead of -14.

So, although none of the options directly match the given condition, we can infer the correct answer by understanding the inverse operation.

The final answer is: **None of the above**

Answer: No Answer
