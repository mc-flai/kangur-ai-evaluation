Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the information given in the problem and use logical reasoning. The problem states that the number of boys in the class has increased by 20% compared to the previous year, and the number of girls has decreased by 20%. There is now one person more than before in the class. We are asked to find the current number of students in the class. Let's denote the number of boys in the previous year as B and the number of girls in the previous year as G. The total number of students in the previous year is B + G. The number of boys has increased by 20%, so the current number of boys is B + 0.2B = 1.2B. The number of girls has decreased by 20%, so the current number of girls is G - 0.2G = 0.8G. The total number of students in the current year is 1.2B + 0.8G. Since there is now one person more than before in the class, we can set up the equation: 1.2B + 0.8G = B + G + 1. Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.2B = 0.8G - 1. Dividing both sides by 0.2, we get: B = 4G - 5. Since B and G must be positive integers, we can test different values for G to find a solution. If G = 1, then B = 4(1) - 5 = -1, which is not possible. If G = 2, then B = 4(2) - 5 = 3, which is possible. If G = 3, then B = 4(3) - 5 = 7, which is possible. If G = 4, then B = 4(4) - 5 = 11, which is possible. We can stop here since the number of boys cannot increase by more than 11 when the number of girls decreases by 10. Therefore, the possible values for the number of girls in the current year are: *   2  *   3  *   4. Now, let's find the corresponding number of boys for each value of G: *   If G = 2, then B = 4G - 5 = 4(2) - 5 = 3. 

Answer: No Answer.
