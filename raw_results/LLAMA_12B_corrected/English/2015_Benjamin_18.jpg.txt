Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to use the concept of permutations and combinations. 

1. **Worst-Case Scenario**: We can ignore the yellow apples and pears for now since finding at least one of them is not a concern. So, we focus on ensuring we have at least one green apple and one green pear.

2. **Combination of Worst-Case Scenarios**: The worst-case scenario for green fruits would be taking everything else out first, which means taking out all 7 green pears and 2 yellow pears (since these are not our focus). That leaves us with all 8 green fruits.

3. **Calculating**: To ensure we have at least one green apple, if we take out one green fruit in the initial draws, it could be either an apple or a pear. Afterward, since we are concerned only about finding at least one green apple and one green pear, we differentiate scenarios post-drawing that first green fruit:

   - If that first draw is a green pear (7 possibilities), then the next draw must bring a green apple to fulfill our requirement. Since the worst case as calculated gives us 7 green pears, ensuring one green apple among the remaining 8 is guaranteed.

   - If that first draw is a green apple (3 possibilities), we've met our requirement without need for a second draw concerning green fruits.

   Given these considerations, we realize the total number of pieces needed to guarantee this outcome accounts for the scenario of potentially needing two draws after the initial non-green or mixed-friends draw to confirm our verifying statuses. So, adding nothing further to our considerations, given the 3 green apples and 7 green pears as subject elements at play here: The no Green-fruit-or-Apple deal was representative of fuller pacing assert=Explanation alone-/s
