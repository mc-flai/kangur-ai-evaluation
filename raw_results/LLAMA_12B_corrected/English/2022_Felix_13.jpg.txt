Reasoning: The question states that the numbers in the five circles around each house add up to 20. Additionally, there are several missing numbers. Upon closer examination, we can see that the numbers in the circles already provided are: - House 1: 3 - House 2: 4 - House 3: 5 - House 4: 6 - House 5: 7. These numbers total 25, which is 5 more than the sum of 20. To find the missing number, we need to subtract 5 from 25, resulting in 20. Therefore, the correct answer is 20.

Answer: C) 20
