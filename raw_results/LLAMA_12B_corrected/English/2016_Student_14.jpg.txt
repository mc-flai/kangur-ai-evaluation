Reasoning: To find the measure of angle CAX, we first need to determine the measure of angle A, which can be derived from the given condition. Let's denote the measure of angle A as x. In triangle ABC, because it is a right triangle with side BC being half as long as AC, we can use trigonometry to find the measure of angle C (angle BAC). We know that side BC is half as long as diagonal AC. This information gives us enough information about triangle ABC to solve for angle BAC. Therefore, angle CAX is twice the measure of angle A (since it is the vertex angle of the isosceles triangle).
