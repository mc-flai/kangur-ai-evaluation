Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between the shapes and their positions in the figure. Each child represents a shape: square, grey triangle, or white circle. The problem states that the children place the three shapes on top of each other as seen in the pictures. Let's analyze each option given: (A) 0, (B) 1, (C) 2, (D) 3, (E) 4. Without specific information about the constraints or how the shapes are placed, we cannot directly apply a formula or calculation. However, we can infer based on the structure of the question that the arrangement of these shapes (square, grey triangle, and white circle) is crucial in understanding which option represents the correct placement. Given the lack of specific details or constraints in the question and without any visual information from the "13" option, we cannot accurately determine the correct answer based solely on the question prompt. The question appears to be missing key details that would allow for a logical deduction of the correct placement. Unfortunately, based on the provided information and structure of the question, it's not possible to deduce the correct outcome directly, which typically means one of the provided options (A through E) should match the visual presented in option 13, but without seeing 13, this step is impossible. Thus, selecting an option to fulfill the requirement for a response is challenging without the actual visual or additional context.
