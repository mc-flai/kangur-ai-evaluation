Reasoning: To determine which balloon Mia definitely hit, we need to find the number that is closest to 14 points while also accounting for the scoring conditions of Mia throwing darts at balloons worth 3, 9, 13, 14, and 18 points. She scores a total of 30 points. We will calculate the sum of the points for each combination of balloons Mia could have hit to see which one adds up to 30 points. The possible combinations are: (3) + (9) + (13) + (14) + (18) = 57, (3) + (9) + (13) + (14) = 39, (3) + (9) + (14) + (14) = 40, (3) + (9) + (13) + (18) = 43, (3) + (9) + (14) + (18) = 44, (9) + (13) + (14) + (18) = 54. We see that Mia could only obtain 30 points by hitting the balloons with values of 3, 9, 13, and 14. According to the scoring conditions, Mia definitely hit the balloons with values of **3**, **9**, **13**, and **14** points. This combination is the only one that adds up to 30 points.
