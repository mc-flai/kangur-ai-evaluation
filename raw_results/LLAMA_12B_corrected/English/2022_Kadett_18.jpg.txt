Reasoning: To solve question 18, we need to understand what Werner and Ria have done with the numbers. They have initially written some numbers on a piece of paper whose sum is 22. Ria has then subtracted each number from 7 and has also written down the results. The clue provided is that the sum of Ria's numbers is 34. Let's denote the original numbers written by Werner as $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ and the numbers written by Ria after subtraction from 7 as $7-x_1, 7-x_2, \ldots, 7-x_n$. Given that the sum of Ria's numbers is 34, we can write the equation: $$(7-x_1) + (7-x_2) + \cdots + (7-x_n) = 34$$ Simplifying this equation, we get: $$n \cdot 7 - (x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n) = 34$$ Since we know that the sum of the original numbers is 22, we have: $$x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n = 22$$ Substituting this into the previous equation gives us: $$n \cdot 7 - 22 = 34$$ Solving for $n$, we find: $$7n = 56$$ $$n = 8$$ This means Werner has 8 numbers. Since Ria adds 7 to each of these numbers, and their sum is 56, the only way to achieve this is by having all the numbers equal to 7. Therefore, the numbers Werner wrote down were all 7s. Looking at the provided options, we see that option D is the correct choice, relating to having 7's as the numbers written initially.  
Answer: D)
