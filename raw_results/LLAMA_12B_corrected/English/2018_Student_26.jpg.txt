Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of light reflection and the geometry of the ball's motion. Since the ball is on an idealized rectangular billiard table, we can assume that it bounces off the edges with perfect elasticity. When the ball hits an edge, it will change direction, but its speed and magnitude of velocity remain the same. This means that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. The problem provides a diagram with point M on the long side AB and the ball (point-shaped) being pushed away from M. We are asked to find the distance at which the ball hits this side again if BM = 1.2 m and BN = 0.8 m. Let's denote the point where the ball hits side AB as point N. We know that BM = 1.2 m and BN = 0.8 m. We can see that ∆BAN is similar to ∆CAM because they share the same angle at B and C. Therefore, we can set up a proportion using the corresponding sides: (AN / BH) = (CN / CM). Since BM = 1.2 m and BN = 0.8 m, we can write: CM = BN - AN, CM = 0.8 - x. We also know that BM = 1.2 m, so we can write: BN + BM = AB, 0.8 + 1.2 = AB, AB = 2 m. Now, let's use the fact that the ball hits side AB again after bouncing. This means that CN will be equal to AM. Now we're ready to solve for the distance from the vertex B at which the ball will hit this side again: (AN / BH) = (CN / CM), (x / (2 - x)) = (1.2 / (0.8 - x)), 2 - x = 3x, 4x = 2, x = 0.5.

Answer: B) 1.5 m
