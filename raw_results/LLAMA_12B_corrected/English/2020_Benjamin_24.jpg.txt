Reasoning: To solve question 24, we need to analyze the given images and determine which set of weights will balance the third scale. **Step 1: Identify the patterns in each set of weights** Set A: The first five objects have a weight of 1 unit each. Set B: Triangle = 1 unit, Blue Circle = 2 units, Square = 3 units. Set C: Triangle = 2 units, Blue Circle = 3 units, Square = 4 units. Set D: Triangle = 3 units, Blue Circle = 4 units, Square = 5 units. Set E: No pattern is visible. **Step 2: Determine the pattern for the third scale** The third scale has triangles, blue circles, and squares in the same order as sets B through E. To balance the third scale, we need to find a set of weights that matches the pattern. **Step 3: Match the patterns** The pattern in the question is similar to sets B through E. Set B has a triangle (1 unit), a blue circle (2 units), and a square (3 units). This matches the first scale, which is balanced. The remaining scales should have a cumulative total equal to the sum of the weights on the first scale. Since addition and comparisons were used in step 3, we can use both addition and comparison in our step four. **Step 4: Compare the third scale with each set of weights** Compare the combined weight on scales A and D to scale C. Each scale represents the same number of objects, so they can be used for comparison. Combined weight on first two scales in set A: 5 + 5 = 10 units. Combined weight on first two scales in set D: 6 + 7 = 13 units. Combined weight on scales C: 9 units. Therefore, it is impossible for the sets of objects shown in options B and turned into E, since any of them would not force a negative or $. So, option D is out. Now compare the weight of set A against set C. In order for the weights to balance, the more similar the objects in the two pairs of balanced scales shown at the beginning, the higher the weight in the duplicates shown at the end of the scales for each option would need to be to balance them evenly. The objects in set A are 5 units total per pair of weights while the objects in set D amount to 13 units. Therefore there 3 units per weight in set D only be
