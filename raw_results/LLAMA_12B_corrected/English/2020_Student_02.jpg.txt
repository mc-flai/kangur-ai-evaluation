Reasoning: 

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the distance Johnny walks in a straight line and the circumference of the cylinder. The ant's daily walk is 6 m, and it now walks on the same straight line or above it to go from point A to point B in a cylinder that is one meter high.

First, we need to find the circumference of the base of the cylinder. The formula for the circumference of a circle is $C = 2\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius is half the height of the cylinder, which is 0.5 meters. So, the circumference of the base of the cylinder is $C = 2\pi \times 0.5 = \pi$ meters.

Since the ant walks 6 meters in a straight line, and it now has to go up and down the cylinder, the total distance it will walk is equal to the circumference of the cylinder. Therefore, the total distance Johnny has to walk is $\pi$ meters.

The distance Johnny has to walk is equal to the circumference of the cylinder, which is 6 times the circumference of the base, plus the height of the cylinder, plus the height of A.

Given options:

*   (A) 8 m: This is incorrect because it is 2 times the circumference of the base plus 2 times the height of A.
*   (B) 9 m: This is incorrect because it is 3 times the circumference of the base plus 3 times the height of A.
*   (C) 6 + $\pi$ m: This is the correct answer because it is equal to the circumference of the cylinder.
*   (D) 12 - $\pi$ m: This is incorrect because it is not equal to the circumference of the cylinder.
*   (E) 8 m: This is also incorrect because it is different from the circumference of the cylinder.

Answer: C)
