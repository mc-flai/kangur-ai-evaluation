Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the pattern of Elvis's triangles. The pattern is composed of multiple hexagonal shapes, each with six vertices and six sides. Inside these hexagons, lines are drawn from some vertices to others, forming triangles. 

**Key observations:**

* Pattern (A) has only four connected triangles.
* Pattern (B) matches the given pattern in the question.
* Pattern (C) contains only three connected triangles.
* Pattern (D) bears little resemblance to the given pattern.
* Pattern (E) matches the given pattern in the question.

**Correct answer:** B) or E).

Answer: B)
