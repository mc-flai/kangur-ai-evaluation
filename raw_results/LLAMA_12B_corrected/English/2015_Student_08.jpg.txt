Reasoning: To solve question 8, we need to understand the concept of surface area and how it relates to the given shape - a truncated cone. A truncated cone is a three-dimensional shape formed by cutting off a smaller cone from a larger cone. The surface area of a truncated cone can be calculated by finding the area of the curved surfaces and adding them together. The shape of a truncated cone, the need to cover the outside of the glass (without the upper or lower circle) with colored paper, and the requirement for the paper to completely cover the glass without an overlap are all relevant data. The formula for the lateral (curved) surface area of a truncated cone is given by A = πσL, where σ is the slant height of the frustum (the portion between the bases), and L is the distance between the centers of the two bases. A truncated cone has two circular bases connected by a curved surface. The curved surface can be unfolded to form a circular sector. To determine how much paper is needed to cover the outside of the glass, we need to calculate the lateral (curved) surface area of the truncated cone. Upon analyzing the options with the understanding that the curved surface of a truncated cone can be unfolded into a circular sector, the correct answer becomes apparent. The curved surface's unique geometry allows it to be fully covered without overlap when it is unrolled into a circular sector.
