Reasoning: **Step 1: Identify the total number of fruit Maria wants to divide.**

Maria has a total of 42 apples, 60 peaches, and 90 cherries.

**Step 2: Calculate the average number of fruit each basket should have.**

The average number of each type of fruit per basket can be calculated by dividing the total number of each type of fruit by the number of friends:

Average apples per basket = 42 apples / 5 friends = 8.4 apples per basket  
Average peaches per basket = 60 peaches / 5 friends = 12 peaches per basket  
Average cherries per basket = 90 cherries / 5 friends = 18 cherries per basket  

**Step 3: Determine the number of baskets needed for the largest average quantity of fruit.**

Since the largest average quantity of fruit is for cherries at 18 cherries per basket, Maria will need at least 6 baskets.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of fruit that can be divided with the chosen number of baskets.**

6 baskets with the same average number of fruit will be distributed:  
Baskets with 18 cherries each (for the entire total):  
   (6 baskets * 18 cherries) = The exact can not be obtained by using multiples. The exact is way off after calculation.
