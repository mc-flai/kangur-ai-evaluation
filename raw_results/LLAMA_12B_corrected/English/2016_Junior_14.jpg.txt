Reasoning: To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle which is $\frac{1}{2} \times base \times height$. The base of the triangle is 3 and the height is 1. Therefore, the area of the triangle can be calculated as follows: $\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 1 = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5$. Since the question asks for the percentage of the area of the triangle that is coloured in grey, we need to find the ratio of the coloured area to the total area of the triangle. The coloured area is half of the triangle's area since it is shaded on one side of the triangle. Therefore, the coloured area is $\frac{1.5}{2} = 0.75$ or $\frac{3}{4}$ of the total area. To find the percentage of the area that is coloured in grey, we can multiply the ratio by 100: $\frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75\%$
