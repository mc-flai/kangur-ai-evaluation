Reasoning: The question is asking for the last digit from the case when you have all digits for the year 2014 and each is different, and the sum of the other digits is bigger than the last digit. If the sum of the other digits is bigger than 5, this option could be a candidate. For these numbers, the sum of the digits is 6 and 4, which adds up to 10. In this case, the 1 is the last digit. For these numbers, the sum of the digits is 3 and 6, which adds up to 9. For these numbers, the sum of the digits is 9 and 8, which adds up to 17. For these numbers, the sum of the digits is 4 and 8, which adds up to 12. All digits are different and the last digit is bigger than the sum of other digits when we take into consideration 12+17=29 which is greater than 5.
