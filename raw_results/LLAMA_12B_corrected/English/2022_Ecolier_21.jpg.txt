Reasoning: The question asks about the number of rounds Ahmed has to walk to meet Sara in point A again for the first time. Ahmed moves from point A in the direction shown with the same speed, and Ahmed walks around the square garden and Sara walks around the rectangular garden. To find the solution, we need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the perimeter of the square and the rectangular garden. The perimeter of the square is 4s, where s is the side length of the square. The perimeter of the rectangle is 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width of the rectangle. Let's assume that l = 5m and w = 10m. Then, the perimeter of the rectangle is 2(5 + 10) = 30m. Since the problem states that Ahmed and Sara move at the same speed, we can assume that one round around the square is equal to 4s units, and one round around the rectangle is equal to 30 units. The LCM of 4s and 30 is found by factoring each number into its prime factors. The prime factors of 4s are 2^2 and s, and the prime factors of 30 are 2, 3, and 5. To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either factorization: 2^2 (from 4s), 3 (from 30), and s (from 4s). Therefore, the LCM is 2^2 * 3 * s = 12s. Based on the calculated LCM, we can now determine if Ahmed has to walk more than three rounds to meet Sara in point A again for the first time. If s > 5, then 12s > 60, and Ahmed has to walk more than three rounds. If s < 5, then 12s < 60, and Ahmed has to walk less than three rounds. If s = 5, then 12s = 60, and Ahmed has to walk three rounds. Therefore, the correct answer is that Ahmed has to walk **more than 60 units** to meet Sara in point A again.
