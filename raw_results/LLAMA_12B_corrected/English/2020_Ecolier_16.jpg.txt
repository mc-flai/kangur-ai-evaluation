Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of reals (Rs) each person has and the total cost of the entrance to the movie.

Initially, Ana, Bia, and Cris have 100 reals in total. They divide this amount equally among themselves before paying the entrance fee. Since they go together, they pay their own entrance fee, which means each of them pays an equal share.

The total cost of the entrance to the movie is given as R$20. We are asked to find how much each person pays.

Given that Ana has twice as much as each of her friends before paying the entrance fee, we can represent the amount each friend has as "x". Therefore, Ana has 2x.

Since they have a total of 100 reals, we can write the equation:

x + x + x = 100

Combine like terms:

3x = 100

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 33.33

So each of them has 33.33 reals.

Now, they pay R$20 for the entrance, so we need to find out how this amount is distributed among them based on the information provided.

Since Ana has twice as much as each friend before they paid the entrance fee, let's calculate how much money Ana, Bia, and Cris have after paying the entrance fee:

- Ana pays her share and still has R$37.49. However, according to the question, now Ana has three times what the two friends have together.
- Therefore, we can assume the two friends have R$20 / 3 = R$6.67, which seems to be a reasonable distribution considering they would have spent their initial shares on the entrance fee.

This distribution makes sense because we know the total money was 100 reals, and the entrance cost was 20 reals. Sooo, they spent 100 - 20 = R$80, following this logic:

- Ana = R$37.49
- Bia = R$17.02
- Cris = R$25.49

However, to correctly match the distributions (ana pays a bit less than the other two otherwise), we need to distribute the entrance money differently, respecting that the total should be the least. So, we recalculate:

- The entrance is now R$17.
- Bia = x$11.50
- Cris = x$11.50
- And by
