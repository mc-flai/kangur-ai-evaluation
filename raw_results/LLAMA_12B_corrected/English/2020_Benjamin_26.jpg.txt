Reasoning: 

To determine which balanced numbers are divisible by 18, we need to find numbers where the arithmetic mean of the three digits is also divisible by 3.

A balanced number is one where the middle digit is the arithmetic mean of the other two digits.

*   **140:** The middle digit (4) is the arithmetic mean of the other two digits (1 and 0). 140 is divisible by 18.
*   **660:** The middle digit (6) is the arithmetic mean of the other two digits (6 and 6). 660 is divisible by 18.
*   **1080:** The middle digit (0) is the arithmetic mean of the other two digits (1 and 0). 1080 is divisible by 18.

**Balanced Numbers Divisible by 18:**

(A) 140

(B) 660

(C) 1080

**Answer:** B), C)
