Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of green paint needed to obtain exactly 5 litres of green shade. The painter mistakenly used 3 litres of blue paint and 2 litres of yellow paint, which he believes will produce the correct shade of green. We know that the effect of mixing paints is a simple mixture. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: $$\frac{a}{3} \cdot 2 + \frac{b}{2} \cdot 3 + \frac{c}{9} \cdot 5 = 5$$ where a, b, and c are the amounts of blue, yellow, and green paint respectively. We also know that the total amount of green paint used is 5 - (3 + 2) = 0. Substituting this into the equation, we get: $$\frac{a}{3} \cdot 2 + \frac{b}{2} \cdot 3 + \frac{c}{9} \cdot 5 = \frac{c}{9} \cdot 9 = 1$$ Simplifying further, we get: $$\frac{a}{3} + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{c}{9} = 1$$ Now, let's analyze the options given: A) $\frac{5}{3}$ litre B) $\frac{3}{2}$ litre C) $\frac{2}{3}$ litre D) $\frac{3}{5}$ litre E) $\frac{5}{9}$ litre Given the equation, we can see that the only option that satisfies the equation is option A) $\frac{5}{3}$ litre. Therefore, the minimum amount of green paint needed to get exactly 5 litres of the correct shade of green is $\frac{5}{3}$ litre. Based on the mathematical analysis, the minimum amount of green paint needed to get exactly 5 litres of the correct shade of green is $\frac{5}{3}$ litre.
