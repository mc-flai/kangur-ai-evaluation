Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of similarity between shapes and how it relates to their volumes and surface areas. The problem states that the submerged volume of an iceberg in the form of a cube corresponds to 96.4% of the volume of the iceberg. This means that 96.4% of the iceberg's total volume is below the waterline, while the remaining 3.6% is above the waterline. Let's consider a cube with side length 'a'. The volume of this cube is given by V = a^3. Since the submerged volume of the iceberg is 96.4% of the total volume, we can set up the equation: V_submerged = 0.964 * V_total. We are not given the exact value of V_total, but we know that the iceberg is in the shape of a cube. Now, let's consider the relationship between the surface area of an object and its volume. The surface area (A) of a cube with side length 'a' is given by A = 6a^2. We are asked to find the percentage of the surface area that is in contact with the air, i.e., the surface area above the waterline. Since three edges of the cube are below the waterline, the surface area above the waterline is three-quarters of the total surface area. Therefore, the percentage of the surface area in contact with the air is: \[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) \times 100\% \] Substituting the value of 3/4 as a decimal, we get: \[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) \times 100\% = 75\% \] However, the options do not include 75%. Therefore, between the options given, only option B) 21% seems to offer the closest approximation.  
Answer: B) 21%
