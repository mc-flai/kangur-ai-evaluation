Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the pattern described by Juca. The problem states that Juca wrote a whole number greater than zero in each of the boxes on the 3 x 3 board on the right, so that the sums of the numbers in each row and in each column are equal. This means that the sum of the numbers in each row and column must be the same. The only thing Juca remembers is that there are no three numbers repeated. Let's analyze the options: (A) 1, 1, 1 (B) 2, 2, 2 (C) 4, 4, 4 (D) 5, 5, 5 (E) 6, 6, 6. None of these options have the same sum in each row and column. However, if we look at the options (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E), they all have the same sum in each row and column. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A), B), C), D), or E)
