Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Anna's spending and Claudia's spending. Let's break it down step by step: * Bettina spends 85% less than Claudia. This means if Claudia spends x euros, Bettina spends 0.15x euros. * Anna spends 60% more than Claudia. This means if Claudia spends x euros, Anna spends 1.6x euros. We are given that together they spend 55 euros, which can be represented as: Claudia + Anna + Bettina = 55. Substituting the expressions for Anna and Bettina in terms of Claudia, we get: x + 1.6x + 0.15x = 55. Combine like terms: 2.75x = 55. Divide both sides by 2.75: x = 20. So, Claudia spends 20 euros. Now, we can find Anna's spending: Anna = 1.6 * 20 = 32 euros. Therefore, the correct answer is **(E) 32**.
