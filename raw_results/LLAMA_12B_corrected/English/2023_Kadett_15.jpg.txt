Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the geometric properties of a square and how points on a plane surface relate to its corners. The key insight here is that the distances from any point on a square's plane surface to two of its corner points are equal. This is because all sides and diagonals of a square are congruent (equal in length). Given this property, we can deduce that any point on the plane surface of a square will be 1 cm away from any pair of opposite corners. This is because the diagonal splits the square into two 45-45-90 right triangles, and in such triangles, the hypotenuse (the diagonal) is \(\sqrt{2}\) times the length of a leg (which would represent half the side length). However, a key aspect of the question is that it asks for points that are **exactly** 1 cm away from two corner points. For a point to be exactly 1 cm away from two opposite corners of a square (without being on the diagonal itself or at the midpoint of the diagonal), it must be part of the smaller squares formed by dividing the large square into four equal smaller squares diagonally and then focusing on one of the smaller squares. In this scenario, each smaller square has \(0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25\) cm\(^2\), and the diagonal of each smaller square cuts it into two right-angled triangles where the ratio of sides relates as \(1:1:\sqrt{2}\). Thus, for a point to be 1 cm away from two corner points of this smaller square (and not on the diagonal or the midpoint of the line connecting those points), it must lie on a perpendicular line drawn from one corner of the smaller square to the opposite side. This does not align with forming an exact right-angled triangle with legs of equal length like \(1:1\password\) unless we're dealing with half the side. Therefore, the explanations given in the rationale do not directly apply to finding a point that is **exactly** 1 cm away from two corner points of a square, especially considering the options provided which likely refer to calculating the maximum or minimum distance from a corner to include points on the plane surface. The problem seems to aim at understanding the distance relationship in two-dimensional geometry rather than identifying a specific point meeting the condition with the exact numerical answers provided. However, typically the distances would be measured from the two alternative corner points, which would indeed align if you
