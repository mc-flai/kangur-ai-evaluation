Reasoning: To find the area of the white part, we can subtract the area of the shaded circles from the area of the entire square. The radius of each shaded circle is half of the side length of the square, which is $\frac{4}{2} = 2$. Therefore, the radius of each shaded circle is $2$. The area of one shaded circle is $\pi r^2 = \pi(2)^2 = 4\pi$. Since there are four shaded circles, the total area of the shaded circles is $4 \times 4\pi = 16\pi$. The area of the entire square is $4^2 = 16$. Therefore, the area of the white part is $16 - 16\pi$. Now, comparing this with the given options: (A) $2\pi$ (B) $8$ (C) $6 + \pi$ (D) $3\pi - 2$ (E) $3\pi$. Option (C) $6 + \pi$ is closest to the area of the white part, but it is not exactly equal. Therefore, the correct answer is **None of the above**, as the exact answer is not among the options provided. In a real-world timed exam situation, you might not have the luxury of calculating the exact value of the area of the white part. In such cases, you would likely choose the option that is closest to the correct value, which would be option (C) $6 + \pi$. However, it's important to note that this is an approximation and not the exact area of the white part.
