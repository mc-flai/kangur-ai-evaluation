Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the possible orderings of the toys on the shelf. Since Joseph has a toy car, a teddy bear, a ball, and a ship, he can arrange them in any order he likes. Let's analyze each option: Option (A) 2: There are indeed 2 possible orderings for 2 items: CD and DC. Option (B) 4: For 4 items, there are 4!: 24 possible orderings (e.g., ABCD, ABDC, ADCB, etc.). Option (C) 5: With 5 items, there are 5!: 120 possible orderings (e.g., ABCDE, ABDEC, ADBCE, etc.). Option (D) 6: For 6 items, there are 6!: 720 possible orderings (e.g., ABCDEF, ABDEF, ABEFD, etc.). Option (E) 8: For 8 items, there are 8!: 40,320 possible orderings. Considering these calculations, we can conclude that the correct answer is **(B) 4**, as there are exactly 4 possible orderings for 4 items.
