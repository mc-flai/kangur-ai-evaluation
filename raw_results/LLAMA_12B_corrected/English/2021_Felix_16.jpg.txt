**Reasoning:**

To solve this problem, let's analyze the information given:

*   There are two branches where the kangaroo has lunch.
*   Each branch has 10 leaves.
*   The kangaroo ate some leaves from one branch and then ate as many leaves as were left on the first branch from the second branch.

Let's denote the number of leaves eaten from the first branch as x. After eating from the first branch, there are 10 - x leaves remaining on the first branch.

The kangaroo then ate (10 - x) leaves from the second branch. This means that after eating from the second branch, there are 10 - (10 - x) = x leaves left on the second branch.

Since the question asks how many leaves are left in total on both branches, we need to add the remaining leaves from both branches: (10 - x) + x = 10.

However, the question has multiple options, and we don't know the exact value of x. Therefore, we cannot determine the total number of leaves left based on the information given.

But if we analyze the options:

*   Option (A) suggests 5 leaves remaining in total.
*   Option (B) suggests 6 leaves remaining in total.
*   Options (C), (D), and (E) suggest 8, 10, and 15 leaves remaining in total, respectively.

Since there are 10 leaves on each branch initially, if the kangaroo eats all leaves from one branch and none from the other, there would be 10 leaves remaining on one branch and 0 leaves on the other. If the kangaroo eats all leaves from both branches, then there would be 0 leaves remaining on both branches.

Considering these possibilities, the most plausible scenario is that the kangaroo ate the same number of leaves from each branch, which would leave an equal number of leaves on each branch after eating within the range provided by the options.

Given the task is to select two branches and based on the general understanding of the problem, it seems logical that the kangaroo distributed the eating evenly, leading to a balanced ending point.

**Answer:** B)
