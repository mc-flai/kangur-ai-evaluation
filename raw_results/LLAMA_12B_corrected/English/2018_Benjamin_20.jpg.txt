Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of each ball and then determine which balls of the sum are named. The balls come in two different weights: 50 g and 80 g. Let's assign X as the weight of the balls with 50 g. Since there must be 3 balls in one stack and 2 balls in another stack for the total weight to be 30 g, let's set up the following equations: *   Equations representing 4.5 X + 1 X = 80, *   4.5 X + 1 X = 80, *   5.5 X = 80, *   X = 14.5 If the unmarked balls are 50 g and the marked balls are 80g: The sum of the balls in A is (50+50) + (50+80) = 230 g, which is greater than 30 g. The sum of the balls in B is (50+50) + (50+50) = 200 g, which is greater than 30 g. The sum of the balls in C is (50+50+80) = 180 g, which is less than 30 g. The sum of the balls in D is (80+80) = 160 g, which is less than 30 g. The sum of the balls in E is (80+80+50) = 210 g, which is greater than 30 g. Hence, the correct answer is C).
