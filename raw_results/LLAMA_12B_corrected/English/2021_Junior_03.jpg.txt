Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the three paths provided in question 3 and determine if they comply with each of the given options. We will examine each path from top to bottom.

Path P has an increase of 1 unit in the horizontal direction, followed by a decrease of 1 unit. Then, it increases by 2 units horizontally and decreases by 2 units vertically. Lastly, it increases by 3 units horizontally and decreases by 3 units vertically. The path does not always increase or decrease with the same magnitude, violating options (A), (B), and (C). It does not follow the same pattern of increase and decrease for both horizontal and vertical directions, violating options (D) and (E).

Path Q increases by 2 units horizontally and then decreases by 2 units vertically. It follows the same pattern of increasing or decreasing for both horizontal and vertical directions, fulfilling options (D) and (E). However, it does not always decrease by the same magnitude as the decrease in the horizontal direction, violating option (B).

Path R increases by 1 unit horizontally and then decreases by 1 unit vertically. Then, it increases by 2 units horizontally and decreases by 2 units. The changes are not equal, violating option (B). However, it maintains the same pattern of change for both horizontal and vertical directions, fulfilling option (D). It does not follow the same rule of having these increases and decreases equal in magnitude, violating option (E).

Answer: D)
