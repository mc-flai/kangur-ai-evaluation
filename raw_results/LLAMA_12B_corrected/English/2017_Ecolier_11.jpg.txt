Reasoning: 

To find the minimum number of packages Marius has to buy, we need to consider the minimum number of balloons each package contains and divide the total number of balloons by this amount. The options given are packages of 5, 10, or 25 pieces each, and Marius buys exactly 70 balloons.

First, let's see if Marius can buy 70 balloons in packages of 5. If he buys 14 packages of 5 (which equals 70), he will use 14 x 5 = 70 balloons, but this option is not available as it is outside the given choices.

Next, let's check if Marius can buy 70 balloons in packages of 10. If he buys 7 packages of 10 (which equals 70), he will use 7 x 10 = 70 balloons, but this option is not available as it is outside the given choices.

Finally, let's see if Marius can buy 70 balloons in packages of 25. If he buys 3 packages of 25 (which equals 75), he will use 3 x 25 = 75 balloons, exceeding his needs of 70 balloons. If he buys 2 packages of 25 (which equals 50), and then buys an additional 4 packages of 5, he will use 2 x 25 + 4 x 5 = 50 + 20 = 70 balloons, totaling 3 units (2 of 25 and 1 of 5).
