Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of adding vectors and how it applies to a situation with a Mean Increase. Given that Viola has jumped 3.80m on average so far, and on the next jump she reaches 3.99m and thus the mean increases to 3.81m, we can infer that she needs to jump on her next attempt in order to increase her mean to 3.82m. The key concept here is understanding that the addition of the next jump height needs to be such that when added to 3.80m (the current average), the new average becomes 3.82m. Since the question asks for the next jump height in order to achieve a mean increase to 3.82m, we simply add the difference between the target average and the current average to the current average. Mathematically, this can be represented as follows: Current Average + Next Jump Height - Current Jump Height = New Average. Here, we know the current average is 3.80, and we want the new average to be 3.82, so the equation becomes: 3.80 + Next Jump Height - 3.80 = 3.82. Simplifying this gives: Next Jump Height = 3.82 - 3.80 = 0.02. However, this is the height increase needed relative to the previous jump, not the absolute next jump height. Since she already jumped 3.99m on the previous attempt, the actual next jump height should be: Next Jump Height = Previous Attempt Height + Height Increase Needed. Substituting the known values: Next Jump Height = 3.99M + 0.02M. Next Jump Height = 4.01M. Therefore, according to the given options and our calculation, Viola needs to jump 4.01m on her next attempt to increase her mean to 3.82m. The closest answer from the provided options is: **Option C) 4.01m**
