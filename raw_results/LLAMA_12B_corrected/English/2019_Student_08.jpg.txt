Reasoning: We are tasked with identifying the numbers from 2^10 to 2^13 that are divisible by 2^8. 2^10 = 1024, 2^11 = 2048, 2^12 = 4096, and 2^13 = 8192. 2^10 is not divisible by 2^8 because 2^10 = 1024 and 2^8 = 256. However, 2^11 (2048) is divisible by 2^8 since 2048/256 = 8. Similarly, 2^12 (4096) and 2^13 (8192) are also divisible by 2^8. Based on the checks made in step 3, the correct answer is E. The correct answer choice is E) 16.
Answer: E)
