Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between the volume of a cylinder and its radius and height. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = Ï€r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. In this problem, we are dealing with two identical cylinders cut open along the vertical dotted line. When they are stuck together, they form a new cylinder with a larger radius but the same height as the original cylinders. The radius of the new cylinder is the sum of the radii of the two original cylinders, which means it is twice the radius of one of the original cylinders. Since the height remains the same, the volume of the resulting cylinder is four times the volume of one of the original cylinders (because the radius has increased by a factor of 2).
