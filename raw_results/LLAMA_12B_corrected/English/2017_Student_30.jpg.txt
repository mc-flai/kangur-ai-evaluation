Reasoning: 

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of noblemen on the island.

*   The question states that there are 30 2017 people living on an island.
*   Each person is either a liar (who always lies) or a nobleman (who always tells the truth).
*   Over a thousand of them attend a banquet where they all sit together around one big round table.
*   Everyone is saying, "Of my two neighbors, one is a liar and one is a nobleman."
*   The goal is to find the maximum number of noblemen on the island.

Let's analyze the situation:

*   If a person is a liar, they will always lie about their neighbors.
*   If a person is a nobleman, they will always tell the truth about their neighbors.
*   Since everyone is saying, "Of my two neighbors, one is a liar and one is a nobleman," we can conclude that each person is sitting next to one liar and one nobleman.
*   The only way this can happen is if there are an odd number of people at the table. If there were an even number of people, one person would be sitting next to two of the same type.
*   Since there are over a thousand people attending the banquet, the total number of people at the table must be at least 1001.
*   In this case, the maximum number of noblemen at the table would be half of the total number of people, which is 500.5.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a person, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the maximum number of noblemen on the island is 500.

Answer: A) 500
