Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the rules of letter-number substitution in a padlock key. Each letter of the alphabet is represented by a unique digit from 1 to 26. Since D is the fourth letter of the alphabet, it corresponds to the number 4. **Translations of letters to numbers**: A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, D = 4, E = 5, F = 6, G = 7, H = 8, I = 9, J = 10, K = 11, L = 12, M = 13, N = 14, O = 15, P = 16, Q = 17, R = 18, S = 19, T = 20, U = 21, V = 22, W = 23, X = 24, Y = 25, Z = 26. Following this pattern, the first letter A corresponds to the number 1, and C corresponds to the number 3. In the numerical conversion, "BHD" translates to the three digits 2, 8, and 4. There is a signification requirement that each digit must appear in the key exactly according to that given in the lock. This brings us to option B, **BHD**, since when translated into numbers, B = 2, H = 8, and D = 4. Letting it all have a unified numerical value should result in **824**.
