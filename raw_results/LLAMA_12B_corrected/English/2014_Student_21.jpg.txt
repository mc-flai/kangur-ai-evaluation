Reasoning: To determine if the given statements are true or false, we must analyze each statement individually and provide reasoning for the correct answers. 

**Statement (A): $a > 0$**

*   If $a > 0$, then $-2a < 0$. Since $-b^2$ is always positive when $b > 0$, both signs of the first equation are positive.
*   However, $a^2$ is always positive for any $a$. When $a > 0$, $a^3$ will also be positive.
*   Considering the given equation, $(-3)^{2n + 2} \times a^{4n + 1} \times b^{2n + 5} \times c^{3n - 4}$, all terms are positive if $a > 0$. Therefore, the statement $a > 0$ is **true**.

**Statement (B): $b > 0$**

*   Given that $b > 0$, $-b^2$ is negative. Additionally, $a^2$ and $c^3$ are always positive for $a$ and $c > 0$. As a result, the signs of the first equation revert from $(-)$ to $(+)$ for $b > 0$. Therefore, the statement $b > 0$ is **true**.

**Statement (C): $c > 0$**

*   Given that $c > 0$, $-c^3$ is negative, and both $a^2$ and $b^2$ are positive. Therefore, the signs of the equations change to $(+)$ for $c > 0$. Hence, the statement $c > 0$ is **true**.

**Statement (D): $a < 0$**

*   Considering the case when $a > 0$, $a^3$ is not always negative, instead it is always positive. If $a < 0$, $a^3$ will be negative, which changes the sign of the overall expression. Therefore, the statement $a < 0$ is **false**.

**Statement (E): $b < 0$**

*   When $b < 0$, $b^2$ is positive. However, if $a^2$ is also positive, then the positivity sign is maintained. Therefore, the statement $b < 0$ is **true**.
