Reasoning: There are 12 children in front of a zoo. Susip is the 7th from the front. Kim stands 2nd from the back. To find out where they are in relation to each other, we will determine the position of Susip and Kim separately before calculating their difference accordingly. Susip is 7th from the front. The other kids could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in front of her. Similarly, Kim is 2nd from the back (12th - 10 = 2). Now that we know their positions we can calculate the difference: (7 - 2) + 1 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 children between Susip and Kim.
