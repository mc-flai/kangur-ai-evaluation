**Reasoning:**

To answer this question, we need to identify which of the clouds contain only numbers that are smaller than 7.

Cloud (A) contains the numbers 6 and 1, both of which are smaller than 7.

Cloud (B) contains the numbers 9, 5, and 3, none of which are smaller than 7.

Cloud (C) contains the numbers 6, 2, and 4, all of which are smaller than 7.

Cloud (D) contains the numbers 5, 2, and 1, all of which are smaller than 7.

Cloud (E) contains the numbers 8, 10, and 7, none of which are smaller than 7.

Therefore, the clouds that contain only numbers smaller than 7 are Clouds (A), (C), and (D).

**Answer:** A), C), D)
