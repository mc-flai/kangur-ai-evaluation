Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the pattern of removal of tiles and then count the remaining tiles after each set of removals. The pattern is as follows:

1. Adam removes every sixth tile.
2. Then Beate removes every fifth of the remaining tiles.
3. Subsequently Cora removes every fourth of the remaining tiles.

Let's calculate the number of tiles left after each set of removals:

**Initial tiles:** 2022

**After Adam's removals (every sixth tile):**

2022 / 6 = 337 tiles remaining

**After Beate's removals (every fifth of the remaining tiles):**

337 / 5 = 67 tiles remaining

**After Cora's removals (every fourth of the remaining tiles):**

67 / 4 = 16.75 tiles remaining

Since you cannot have a fraction of a tile, Cora will remove the remaining tiles, leaving 16 tiles.

Therefore, the number of tiles left is **16**.

Answer: A) 16
