Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the given digits and the figure. The figure has a ladder with 3 steps, each labeled with a number in base 10. The letters A, B, C, and D represent different digits. We can start by analyzing each step of the ladder: Step 1: The first step has the label "18". This means that the first digit (A) represents the tens place, which is 1, and the second digit (B) represents the ones place, which is 8. Step 2: The second step has the label "20". This means that the first digit (B) represents the tens place, which is 2, and the second digit (C) represents the ones place, which is 0. Step 3: The third step has the label "22". This means that the first digit (C) represents the tens place, which is 2, and the second digit (D) represents the ones place, which is 2. Based on this analysis, we can determine the correct ordering of the letters: A = 1, B = 8, C = 2, D = 2. The correct answer is A) 1, B) 2, C) 8, D) 2.
Answer: A) 1, B) 2, C) 8, D) 2.
