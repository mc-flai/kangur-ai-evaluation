Reasoning: 

To solve this problem, we need to understand the given information and apply mathematical concepts.

1. **Total number of participants**: The total number of participants is 800.
2. **Percentage of females**: 35% of the participants are female.
3. **Disparity between male and female participants**: There are 252 more male than female participants.

Let's denote the number of female participants as F and the number of male participants as M.

*   Given that 35% of the participants are female, we can express the number of female participants as: F = 0.35 * 800 = 280.
*   Since there are 252 more male than female participants, the number of male participants is: M = F + 252 = 280 + 252 = 532.
*   The total number of participants is the sum of male and female participants: Total = M + F = 532 + 280 = 812.

However, the question states that "More than 800 people take part in the kangaroo-run." Our calculations show a discrepancy with the provided options, which are lower than 812. This suggests that an error has been made in our understanding of the question or in the provided options. Given the options align more closely with the stated condition of having fewer than 800 people, despite our calculation indicating more than 800, it seems there might be confusion in interpreting the question's requirement. Based on standard mathematical interpretation rules, we'll proceed under the assumption that the intent was to find a number below 800 without directly applying our calculation result since it contradicts the provided choices.

Answer: E) 840
