Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of the volume of a cylinder and how changes in dimensions affect this volume. Cylinder A has a radius of r and a height of 10r. Cylinder B has a radius that is 10% bigger than Cylinder A's radius, so the radius of Cylinder B is 1.1r, and its height is greater than Cylinder A's by the stated amount. The formula for the volume (V) of a cylinder is given by V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. The volume of Cylinder A is calculated as πr^2 * 10r = 10πr^3, while the volume of Cylinder B is π(1.1r)^2 * (11r) since its height is 11% greater than A's. The difference in volume is calculated as Volume of B - Volume of A, which can be simplified using the formulas mentioned above to compare the effect of increased height on volume. When calculating percentages, we are essentially looking for how much the original size has been increased relative to itself, using the formula for percentage change or increase as ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100%. We know the height of A is 10r and of B is increased by 11%, thus B's height = 10r * 1.11 = 11.1r. Comparing volumes based on the given percentages directly might not be as straightforward without explicit dimensions or volume calculations, which isn't necessary given we are told what percentage changes (heightenned and radii-ened). Given option C says the relationship between the two volumes is in the ratio of 100:121 (13^2), reflecting both height and radius changes, which aligns with the increase described in the problem statement regarding height. Hence, option C seems plausible as it directly addresses a ratio that could result from both height and radius adjustments. The specific percentage increases for radius (10%) and height (11%) should logically lead to volumes that are 1.1^2 relative ratio when considering the effect on volume just with those changes alone.
