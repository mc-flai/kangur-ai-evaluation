Reasoning: To find the number of possible values for the number $a$ in the given set, we need to understand the equation $b = 2a + 1$ and $c = 2b + 1$. Given that $b = 2a + 1$, and $c = 2b + 1$, we can substitute the value of $b$ into the equation for $c$: $c = 2(2a + 1) + 1$, which simplifies to $c = 4a + 3$. This means that for every value of $a$, there is a corresponding unique value of $c$. Now, let's analyze the options: (A) 0: This value satisfies the equation $b = 2a + 1$ when $a = -1/2$, which is not an integer. So, it is not possible for $a$ to be 0. (B) 1: This value satisfies the equation $b = 2a + 1$ when $a = 0$, which is an integer. This option is possible. (C) 2: This value satisfies the equation $b = 2a + 1$ when $a = 3/2$, which is not an integer. So, it is not possible for $a$ to be 2. (D) 3: This value satisfies the equation $b = 2a + 1$ when $a = 1$, which is an integer. This option is possible. (E) more than 3: Since the value of $c$ increases exponentially with $a$, there are infinitely many values of $a$ for which $c$ will be more than 3. This option is also possible. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1, (D) 3, and (E) more than 3.
