Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of two-digit and three-digit numbers that are obtained by deleting the middle number from a larger number.

*   A two-digit number is any number between 10 and 99, inclusive.
*   A three-digit number is any number between 100 and 999, inclusive.
*   When we delete the middle number from a larger number, we are left with a smaller number. If the middle number was zero, the resulting number would still be a three-digit number because it would not change the number of digits.
*   If the middle number was not zero, the resulting number would be a two-digit number because one digit would be removed from the original three-digit number.

Therefore, the property that we are looking for is that the two-digit number obtained by deleting the middle number is exactly a ninth of the original number.

Let's analyze the options:

*   (A) 1/9: This option is incorrect because 1/9 is not a factor that would result in a two-digit number when multiplied by an integer (since 1/9 is a fraction).
*   (B) 2/9: This option is also incorrect for the same reason as (A).
*   (C) 3/9 = 1/3: This option is incorrect because 1/3 is not a factor that would result in a two-digit number when multiplied by an integer (since 1/3 is a fraction).
*   (D) 4/9: This option is correct because 4/9 is an integer factor (4) that would result in a two-digit number (4 x 9 = 36) when multiplied by 9.
*   (E) 5/9: This option is incorrect because 5/9 is a fraction, and multiplying by 5 would not result in a subtraction of one digit to produce a two-digit number.
*   (Total correct options: D)

Answer: D)
