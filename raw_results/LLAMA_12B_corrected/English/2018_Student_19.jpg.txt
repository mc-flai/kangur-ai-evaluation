Reasoning: To solve question 19, we need to understand the properties of the given cards and how they multiply. Nadia starts with three cards: Card 1: 3 of hearts, Card 2: 4 of diamonds, Card 3: 5 of clubs. According to the problem, Nadia multiplies the values of her cards and then multiplies the two values of Riny's cards. We know that the sum of the values of Nadia's cards is 12. Let's find the sum of Nadia's cards: 3 + 4 + 5 = 12. Now, let's analyze Riny's cards: Card 4: 6 of spades, Card 5: 7 of diamonds. Riny multiplies the two values of his cards. We need to find the sum of these two products. The value of Card 4 is 6, and the value of Card 5 is 7. Therefore, the sum of their products is: (3 * 4) + (4 * 5) + (5 * 6) = 12 + 20 + 30 = 62. We have a two-part problem here. First, we have to find the lost number we multiplied by (i.e., find the value of our first guess), and then determine that value. To find the lost number, let's subtract 62 from 75. We would get the single answer that (12 + 20) + 20 = 52. This means the next number has to be 3 to make "Nadia multiplies the three values of her cards" true. 76 - 62 = 14. Therefore, we can safely assume that Riny multiplied the two values of his cards (6 + 7 = 13). To make both parts of the problem solve true with an additional guess between the books, Nadia multiplied all three numbers together (As expected 4…"63" multiplied 3×4×5= (12* 21 = 252). If our guess is correct, then the subsequent results should equal the sum of these products; if there were four aces to begin with (3 asc…5 ace) 6, so we will still arrive at the following sum, discounted as follows: 75 - 21 = 56. Our aim, then, is to illuminate nafter. Riny eventually finds equations AVGaveN answer. We proceed recover58
