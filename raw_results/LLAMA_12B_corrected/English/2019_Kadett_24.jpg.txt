Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the problem and find the correct answer from the given options. The problem describes an ant crawling along a closed line on the surface of a cube until it reaches its starting point. We are asked to determine which of the following nets of a cube belongs to the cube that the ant is crawling on. To find the correct answer, we need to identify the net that represents the cube where the ant can start and end at the same point after crawling along a closed line on its surface. Let's analyze each option: Option (A) shows a cube with all edges connected to each other, forming a closed loop. Option (B) shows a cube with two edges connected to each other, forming a non-closed loop. Option (C) shows a cube with three edges connected to each other, forming a non-closed loop. Option (D) shows a cube with all edges connected to each other, forming a closed loop, similar to option (A). Option (E) shows a cube with four edges connected to each other, forming a non-closed loop. Based on the analysis, option (A) and option (D) show a cube with a closed loop, which means the ant can start and end at the same point after crawling along the surface of the cube. Therefore, the correct answers are options (A) and (D).
