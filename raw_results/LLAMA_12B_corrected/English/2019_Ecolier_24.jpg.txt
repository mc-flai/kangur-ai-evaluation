Reasoning: The question is about the length the cat will walk following the dotted line route. The cat follows the dotted line between and crossing the line from the top-right corner to the edge of the bottom-right part of the diagram and then left along the bottom edge up to the top-left edge, then up to the top corner, then to the bottom-left corner of the depicted area. The distance is shown as 75 m by adding the info around the dotted line: 36 + 20 + 8 + 11 m = 75 m. Top-right corner to bottom-right edge = 36 m, bottom-right edge up until the bottom-left edge = 20 m, this walking path represents a right angle, hence on that basis, bottom-left edge to corner of left side is not meant. add up and down 8 m (step 2) dbl inf clay rounded, can conclude this base provides the length needed.
Answer: A)
