Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of the probability of rolling a die. Each side of a fair die has an equal chance of landing facing up when it is rolled. The question asks us to determine which of the pictures cannot be a picture of this particular die. There are six sides on a standard die, each numbered from 1 to 6. Each side has a different number of dots. The die must have six sides and a total of 21 dots. The first picture (A) has 21 dots, including 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 dots on each side. The second picture (B) also has 21 dots, including 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 dots on each side. The third picture (C) has 21 dots as well, with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 dots on each side. The fourth picture (D) no longer counts, as the problem specifies the presence of 1, 2, or 3 dots on each side. The fifth picture (E) is not possible since it is missing some digits, violating the rule of having 1, 2, or 3 dots on each side. The correct die pictures have an equal probability of rolling any number from 1 to 6. The probability of rolling a 1 is equal to $\frac{1}{6}$. The probability of rolling a 4 is equal to $\frac{1}{6}$. The probability of rolling a 6 is equal to $\frac{1}{6}$. The probability of rolling a 5 is equal to $\frac{1}{6}$.

Answer: A), B), C).
