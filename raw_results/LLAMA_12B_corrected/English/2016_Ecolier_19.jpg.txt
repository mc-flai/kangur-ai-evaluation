Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of matching numbers to quantities. The question describes a magical garden where there are magic trees, and on each tree, either 6 pears or 3 apples or 8 pears and 4 apples. We are asked to find how many pears in total are hanging on the magic trees altogether. Let's break down the information given: Each tree has either 6 pears, 3 apples, 8 pears, or 4 apples. We know that there are 25 apples on the magic trees. Since each tree can have either 3 apples or 4 apples, let's consider these two cases: Case 1: If all trees have 3 apples, then the total number of apples is 25. Since there are 5 trees (25 รท 5 = 5), each tree would have 3 apples. In this case, 5 trees with 3 apples each would give us a total of 5 * 3 = 15 apples. Case 2: If all trees have 4 apples, then the total number of apples is 25. Again, 5 trees would give us a total of 5 * 4 = 20 apples. Now, let's analyze the given options: (A) 35: This option suggests that all trees have 6 pears and no apples, which does not match our findings. (B) 40: This option suggests that all trees have 8 pears and no apples, but this also does not match our findings. (C) 45: This option suggests that all trees have 6 pears and no apples, which again does not match our findings. (D) 50: This option suggests that all trees have 3 apples and no pears embedded in it. But 5 trees with 4 apples would give more than 50. (E) 56: This option suggests that all trees have 4 apples and no pears embedded in it. This option matches our analysis, where 5 trees with 4 apples each would give us a total of 20 apples, leaving 6 pears unaccounted for, making the total 26 pears. Therefore, the correct answer is option (E) 56.
