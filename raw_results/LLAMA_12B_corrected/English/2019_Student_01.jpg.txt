Reasoning: The flag of Kangoraland is a rectangle which is split into three equal rectangles as shown. **Example**: Design a flag for Thailand consisting of five horizontal stripes of (i) red, (ii) white, (iii) blue, (iv) white, and (v) cream. **Instructions**: * Use Adobe Illustrator, Paint Shop Pro, or other similar programs to draw a square image (it will be easier to work with it if we flip some lines vertically and horizontally). * Create new ruler guides along the middle vertical and horizontal lines to divide the image into four equal horizontal rectangles. * Copy the top rectangle and paste it to the bottom half of the image and rotate its copy 180 degrees to duplicate it. * Duplicate the crece by copying the left rectangle and paste it to the right half of the image and rotate its copy 90 degrees to duplicate it. * Turn off all the palette guides and then you have a Thai flag and all the palette guides will stay functional. * If you copy an image exactly a copy should not be made. When selecting paste command, make sure the position blank box will be at left-most end then a pop-up menu will appear that states "relative to Combined figure followed by "Transparency and Extra Section".  It could be static, background, inverse destination, or use background.
