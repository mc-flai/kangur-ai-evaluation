Reasoning: To determine which speed-time-diagram best describes Maria's journey to school, we need to analyze each option based on the given information. The information states that Maria exited from a stop after two stops and then walked the rest of the way by foot. This means that her speed will be zero in the beginning (at the stops), and then she will start walking. Looking at the options: (A) This diagram shows a constant speed, which does not match the information that Maria stopped twice. (B) This diagram shows a gradual increase in speed over time, which could be consistent with Maria stopping twice and then walking. (C) This diagram shows a sharp increase in speed, which does not match the information that Maria stopped twice. (D) This diagram shows a decrease in speed over time, which does not match the information that Maria stopped twice. (E) This diagram shows a rapid increase in speed, followed by a rapid decrease, which does not match the information that Maria stopped twice. Based on the analysis, option (B) is the most consistent with Maria stopping twice and then walking the rest of the way. It shows a gradual increase in speed, indicating that she started walking after the stops. Therefore, the correct answer is (B). The correct answer can be determined by ruling out the options that do not match the information provided in the problem. This involves analyzing each diagram in relation to the given conditions and selecting the one that best aligns with the description of Maria's journey.

Answer: B)
