Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of probability and how it applies to rolling dice. Each die has two red faces and two blue faces, with two possible colors for each face. We have two equal dice with 4 faces: Red (R) in each die and Blue (B) in each die. When rolling both dice, the total possible outcomes for color combinations are: RR (Red-Red), RB (Red-Blue), BR (Blue-Red), BB (Blue-Blue). The probability of each outcome can be determined by dividing the number of ways the outcome can occur by the total possible outcomes. **RR**: 1 way out of 4 = 1/4 or 25%, **RB** or **BR**: 2 ways out of 4 = 2/4 or 50%, **BB**: 1 way out of 4 = 1/4 or 25%. The question asks for the probability that the result will be two faces with different colors. This scenario includes both **BR** (Blue-Red) and **RB** (Red-Blue), which have a combined probability of 50%.

Answer: B)
