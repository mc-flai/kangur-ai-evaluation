Reasoning: To determine which statements are true, we need to compare the slope of the lines r and s to the coefficient of the x-term in each equation. The slope of a line can be found by rearranging the equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), where m is the slope. 

**Equation Comparison:**

*   Line r: y = ax + b
*   Line s: y = cx + d

**Slope Calculation:**

*   For line r, the slope is 'a'.
*   For line s, the slope is 'c'.

**Statement Analysis:**

A) ab + cd < 0: This statement compares the products of the coefficients of the x-terms in both equations. Since the signs of 'a' and 'c' are unknown, this statement cannot be definitively determined as true or false without additional information.

B) a + b + c + d < 0: This statement compares the sum of the coefficients of the x-terms and the constants in both equations. Since the signs of 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' are unknown, this statement cannot be definitively determined as true or false without additional information.

C) ac + bd â‰¥ 0: This statement considers the possibility that the signs of 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' can make the product of 'ac' and the product of 'bd' non-negative. Given the lack of specifics about the signs of these coefficients, it's also difficult to determine this statement's validity without additional context.

D) a + b + c + d > 0: Similar to statements A and B, due to the unknown signs of 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', this statement cannot be definitively determined without more information.

E) abcd > 0: For this product to be greater than zero, all {a, b, c, d} must either be all positive values or all negative values. Given the lack of specifics about the signs of 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', and the fact that lines r and s could represent any family of lines depending on the value of their coefficients, concluding the truth of this statement based solely on the provided figure or the equations of the lines cannot be accurately determined.

**Conclusion:**

Given the provided details and the format required for the answer, identifying precise answers to the statements regarding the actual right and wrong choices requires more specific information not present.
