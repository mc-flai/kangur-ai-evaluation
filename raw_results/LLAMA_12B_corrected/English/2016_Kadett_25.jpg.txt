Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the process of colouring the cubes and then determine the number of grey cubes at the end of the second day. The problem states that a big cube is made up of 64 small cubes. This means there are 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 corner cubes, 12 edge cubes, and 8 face cubes that are not on an edge or a corner (the lateral surface area). All these cubes are grey initially. On day one, the colouring process starts with one cube. This cube will be colouring its adjacent cubes on the same face, affecting 3 cubes (since there are 3 cubes sharing the same common face). On day two, all grey cubes from the first day (now one cube in the centre) again colour their adjacent cubes on the same face. This action affects 3 more cubes but different from the first day, as these new cubes must now be next to the previously coloured cubes (4 total cubes including the original central grey cube in the 2D slice layer, when considering the corners and middle cells of a 7 by 7 grid square for each possible vertical and horizontal row value). Only 4 new cells should be added in this layer. Since there are no new steps or revisions yet shown on which cubes change colour, by the second day, the colouring process will stop spreading because only one grey cube (central cube the day before) is left to spread the colours in the second layer operation. After adding the grey cubes from the last colouring event (including one cube as the starting point of the operation and 6 new cubes, without subtracting one), after day two we have seven total GREY cubes at this stage work.
