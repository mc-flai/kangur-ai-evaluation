Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the given information and apply geometric principles. The problem describes a path DEFB with DE ⊥ EF and EF ⊥ FB within a square ABCD. It also provides side length information: DE = 5, EF = 1, and FB = 2. First, let's analyze the given information: DE = 5, EF = 1, FB = 2. From the figure, it's clear that DE and FB are perpendicular to each other, and EF is also perpendicular to both DE and FB. This forms a right-angled triangle DEF. Now, let's use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of EF (which is also the length of side DF): DE² + EF² = DF², 5² + 1² = DF², 25 + 1 = DF², 26 = DF². To find the length of DF, take the square root of both sides: DF = √26. Since DF is opposite to EF in triangle DEF, the length of EF can be considered as the height of the right-angled triangle. Therefore, the base of this triangle would be half the sum of DE and FB, which is: Base = (2 × EF) = (2 × 1) = 2. So, the base is twice the length of EF. Now, let's find the area of the triangle: Area = ½ × Base × Height = ½ × 2 × 1 = 1. Since we know the area of the triangle is 3√2, we can set up an equation: 1 = ½ × Base × Height, 1 = ½ × 2 × Height, 1 = Height. This means the height of the triangle is 1. The question asks for the side length of the square, so we need to find the mixed number of 1 of the unit fraction of 5 in jump a1 to a49.
