Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the rules of ball movement in the given scenario. The problem states that "the bigger ball swallows the smaller one and increases its value by the value of the smaller ball." We are asked to determine the final result of the collisions of the 5 balls shown.

Let's break down the information provided:

*   There are 5 balls initially.
*   When two balls go in opposite directions, the bigger ball swallows the smaller one and increases its value by the value of the smaller ball.

Now, let's analyze the collisions:

*   In the first collision (10 and 9), the bigger ball (10) swallows the smaller ball (9) and increases its value to 19.
*   In the second collision (19 and 7), the bigger ball (19) swallows the smaller ball (7) and increases its value to 26.
*   In the third collision (26 and 8), the bigger ball (26) swallows the smaller ball (8) but there is no bigger ball to swallow in the options so we need to look at the fourth and fifth collisions.
*   In the fourth collision (15 and 20), we don't have enough information to determine which ball is bigger,
*   In the fifth collision (49 and 50), again we can't determine which is larger.

Based on the given information, we cannot determine the final result of the collisions. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C)
