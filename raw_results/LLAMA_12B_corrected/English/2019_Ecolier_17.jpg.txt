Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of represents exactly one digit. Each shape represents a number and appears exactly once in the answer box. The given options are A) 2, B) 3, C) 4, D) 5, and E) 6. Let's analyze each option: A) 2: This is not possible because the sum of the digits in each row is stated on the right-hand side of each row. B) 3: This is also not possible for the same reason as option A. C) 4: This is not possible because there are only three digits in the answer box. D) 5: This is not possible because there are not enough digits in the answer box to make a sum of 5. E) 6: This is the only option that makes sense because there are exactly six digits in the answer box, and the sum of the digits in each row is a multiple of 6. Therefore, the correct answer is E) 6.  
Answer: E)
