Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of the numbers written on the faces of the cube. The sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces is always the same. The numbers 1 to 9 are used once each. From these two statements, we can deduce that if two numbers are on opposite faces, they must add up to 10 (since their sum must be the same as the sum of any other pair of opposite faces). The only way to achieve this with the numbers 1 to 9 is if the pairs are 1-9, 2-8, and 3-7. Therefore, the only possible numbers that could have been written on the opposite side with the number 8 are 2 and 7. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is: 

Answer: B)
