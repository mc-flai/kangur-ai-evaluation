Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the constraints and goal of the problem. The goal is to place numbers from 0 to 6 into a 3 x 3 table such that the sum of the four numbers in each 2 x 2 area of the table is the same. We are also told that the numbers in three of the cells in the corner can already be seen in the diagram. Let's break down the information given: The sums of the four numbers in each 2 x 2 area of the table are the same. The numbers in three of the cells in the corner can already be seen in the diagram. From the diagram, we can see that the numbers in the bottom-left corner are 2, 4, and an unknown number represented by "?". The sum of these three numbers must be equal to the sum of the other numbers in the corner, which is 6. To find the missing number, let's calculate the sum of the known numbers in the bottom-left corner: 2 + 4 + ? = 6. Subtracting the known numbers from the total sum: 6 - (2 + 4) = ?. Simplifying the equation: 6 - 6 = ?. The equation becomes: 0. Since 0 is not a valid option, we need to find another solution. Let's consider the other corner, which has the numbers 2, 1, and an unknown number represented by "?". Since the sums must be equal, the unknown number in this corner must be equal to the missing number in the bottom-left corner. We can also use the fact that the sum of the four numbers in each 2 x 2 area of the table is the same. If we assume that the sum of the four numbers in the bottom-left 2 x 2 area is x, then the sum of the four numbers in the top-right 2 x 2 area must also be x. Using the given numbers, we can set up an equation to represent the sum of the four numbers in the top-right 2 x 2 area: 2 + 3 + 1 + ? = x. Since the numbers 2, 3, and 1 are the only known numbers in this area, we can simplify the equation: 6 + ? = x. Subtracting 6 from both sides: ? = x - 6. Now, we have expressed the unknown number in terms of the equal sum x. We can also use the fact.
