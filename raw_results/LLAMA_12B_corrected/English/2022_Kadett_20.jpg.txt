Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of similar figures and their surface areas. When two shapes are similar, their corresponding sides are in proportion, and their corresponding surface areas are in the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Given that the surface areas of the cuboids (in cm^2) are 72, 96, and 102, we can find the scale factor between these areas by dividing one area by another. Let's say we want to compare areas 72 and 96. Scale factor = Square root of (96/72) = √(96/72) = √(4/3) = 2/√3 ≈ 1.15. This means that if you were to scale up the smallest cuboid (with area 72), you would get the cuboid with area 96 by increasing each dimension by approximately 15% (since √(1.15^2) ≈ 1.15/1). Now, let's compare the given options with the calculated scale factors for the areas: * Option A (36 to 48): 48/36 = 4/3 = 1.33 (or 33.33%), close to the calculated scale factor. * Option B (56 to 48): This does not directly compare to our initial analysis since 56 is not given among the original areas. * Option C (52 to 96): This comparison involves the relationship between two volumes that do not directly correlate with the areas provided. Thus, it doesn't fit our initial assessment. * Option D (54 to 72): Similar to option C, this comparison does not directly correlate with the provided areas. * Option E (60 to 102): Like options C and D, this comparison does not directly apply to the given area ratios. Given the incorrect nature of the comparisons above, there seems to have been a misinterpretation in directly matching the given options with calculated scale factors based solely on the areas provided. However, upon reevaluation, we see that none of the given options (A, B, C, D, E) directly match the approach of calculating scale factors for specific pairs of areas mentioned in the problem statement based on the initial explanation. The question was misunderstood in applying the scale factor logic directly to determine which option represents a correct increase in dimensions or area from a smaller to a larger cuboid without explicitly offering data on the linear dimensions.
