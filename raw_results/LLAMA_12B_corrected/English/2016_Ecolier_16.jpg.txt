Reasoning: To determine the number of spaces that will definitely be filled, we need to consider the strategy Hannes can use to choose his first coin and the distribution of the remaining coins around the board. Hannes starts by placing one coin on each of eight spaces that lie next to each other. This essentially creates a "block" or "cluster" of filled spaces on the board. After placing these initial eight coins, Hannes has 7 spaces left to fill. The last coin cannot be placed on either end of the board (since it must go next to one of the previously placed coins), leaving him with 5 spaces that will definitely be filled (the 5 spaces adjacent to the existing cluster). Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 5.

Answer: D) 5
