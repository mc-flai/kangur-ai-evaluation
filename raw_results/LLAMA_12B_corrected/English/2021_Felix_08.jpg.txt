Reasoning: 

To solve this problem, we need to identify which of the given options (A, B, C, D, or E) represents the Kangaroo constellation. The Kangaroo constellation is defined as an arrangement of stars where all stars have a number greater than 3, and their sum is 20.

Let's analyze each option:

*   Option A: The sum of the numbers on the stars is 5 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 23, which is not greater than 3.
*   Option B: The sum of the numbers on the stars is 8 + 5 + 7 + 5 + 4 = 29, which is also not greater than 3.
*   Option C: The sum of the numbers on the stars is 5 + 3 + 2 + 8 + 9 + 4 + 7 = 38, which is greater than 3.
*   Option D: The sum of the numbers on the stars is 1 + 9 + 9 + 8 + 2 + 5 + 3 = 37, which is greater than 3.
*   Option E: The sum of the numbers on the stars is 8 + 2 + 9 + 2 + 9 = 28, which is also not greater than 3.

Based on the condition that all stars have a number greater than 3 and their sum is 20, we can eliminate options A, B, D, and E. Only option C satisfies both conditions.

Answer: C)
