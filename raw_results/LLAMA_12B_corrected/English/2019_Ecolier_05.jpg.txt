Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the arrangement of boot prints and determine which order they would have to be arranged in to match the sequence shown in the diagram. Looking at the diagram, we can see that there is a sequence of boot prints leading from the top of the page down, with each print slightly offset to the right of the previous one. The top row shows a single boot print, while the middle row shows two boot prints side by side. The bottom row shows four boot prints arranged in a staggered pattern. We should look for the option that matches this sequence: * Option A: This option has two boot prints side by side, followed by a single print, and then two more prints side by side. * Option B: This option has a single print, followed by three more prints side by side. * Option C: This option has four prints arranged in a straight line. * Option D: This option has three prints arranged in a staggered pattern. * Option E: This option has two prints side by side, followed by a single print, and then another two prints side by side. Based on the diagram, we can see that the correct sequence starts with two boot prints side by side (option A), followed by a single print, and then back to the side-by-side arrangement. This pattern continues throughout the entire sequence, with the only difference being the number of prints in each row.

Answer: A)
