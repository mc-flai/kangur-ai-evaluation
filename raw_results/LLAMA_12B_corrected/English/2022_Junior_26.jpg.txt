Reasoning: To find the area of triangle FPD, we need to find the lengths of its base and height. Since it shares a side with one of the squares, we can deduce that the base is one of the diagonals of the square (7 cm or 10 cm) and the area is half the product of this length and the height of the triangle, which is the distance between the two diagonals of the square.

We know that the diagonals of the squares are perpendicular, intersecting at their midpoints, and that each vertex of a square is equally distant from the two diagonals. This means that we can draw a perpendicular from point P to the base of the triangle (either the 7 cm diagonal or the 10 cm diagonal) that will bisect the height of the triangle and serve as a height for the right triangle that is half of triangle FPD.

The midpoints of the diagonals are equidistant from the base, and since square ABCD has a side length of 8 cm, the distance from each corner to the midpoint of the opposite diagonal is 2\sqrt{2} cm. Thus, the perpendicular from point P to the diagonal (17.5) can be shown to have a length of 5.5 cm.

Ann is halving the distance from point P to the base, half of that distance being 2.75 cm. Therefore, the area of the triangle FPD is:

\[ A_{\Delta FPD}=0.5\cdot 7 \text{ cm} \cdot 2.75\text{ cm}=9.625\]

As the square has a side length of 8 cm, we do not need to consider any other options. Square ABCD is shown with a smaller square in the middle, with an area twice that of triangle PFB (14.2). Since point P can only take 5 possible coordinates inancellor, each giving rise to a different triangle structure, 7 &#038; 10 cm values are only the ones required to fill all dimensions.

The correct answer is D) 16.5.
