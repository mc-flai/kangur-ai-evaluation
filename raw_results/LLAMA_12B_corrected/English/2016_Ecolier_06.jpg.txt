Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand that Anna has shared her apples fairly between herself and her five girlfriends. Each girl has received half an apple. Let's assume the total number of apples is x. Since there are 6 people (Anna and her 5 girlfriends), the total number of halves would be 6. Each person received half an apple, so the total number of apples is equal to the total number of halves. Therefore, x = 6. Now, we need to find the correct option that matches this value. 

Answer: B)
