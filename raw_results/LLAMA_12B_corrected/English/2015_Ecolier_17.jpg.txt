Reasoning: To determine the number of small triangles Luca will get from cutting a large triangle, we need to count the small triangles produced by each cut. Each cut creates two new triangles that share an edge with the previous triangle. Let's break down the process: 1. The first cut creates two small triangles. 2. The second cut, which is perpendicular to the first cut, creates two more small triangles on each side of the previous cut. This results in a total of four small triangles so far (two from the first cut and two from the second cut). 3. The third cut, which is parallel to the first cut and creates two more small triangles on each side of the previous cuts. This adds four more small triangles to the count, making it eight small triangles in total (four from the first cut and two from each of the second and third cuts). 4. The fourth cut, which is perpendicular to the third cut, creates two more small triangles on each side of the previous cuts. This adds four more small triangles to the count, making it 12 small triangles in total (eight from the previous cuts and four from the fourth cut). This approach shows how Luca would obtain 12 small triangles by cutting a large triangle into Equally Sized Small Triangles (like those in figure 2), following a pattern of perpendicular and parallel cuts.
