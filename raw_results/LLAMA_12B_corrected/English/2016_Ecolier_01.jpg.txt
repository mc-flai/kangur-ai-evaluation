Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, let's examine the information provided in the question. The statement "Who has got the biggest total altogether?" implies that we are looking for the person with the highest total value after rolling two dice. To find the correct answer, we need to add up the values of each person's dice and compare them. Bert: 5 + 3 = 8, Carl: 4 + 6 = 10, Doris: 3 + 3 = 6, Ernst: 5 + 5 = 10, Amy: 2 + 5 = 7. Based on the calculations, both Carl and Ernst have the highest total with a value of 10. 

Answer: No Answer.
