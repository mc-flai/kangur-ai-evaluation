Reasoning: To determine which two people are sitting next to Carina, let's analyze the given information and constraints: Ann and Bob are sitting at a round table. Ann is not next to Bob. Dan is next to Ed and Bob is not next to Dan. Due to the constraint that Ann and Bob are not sitting next to each other, we can eliminate option A (Ann and Bob). Additionally, the fact that Dan is next to Ed and Bob is not next to Dan eliminates option D (Ed and Ann) as well. The only possible arrangement that satisfies all the conditions is the one where Bob and Dan are sitting next to each other, with both pairs sitting on either side of Carina. This eliminates option C (Dan and Ed), as Dan cannot be next to Ed if Bob is not next to Dan. The correct answer is **(B) Bob and Dan**. These are the people who are sitting next to Carina based on the given conditions.  
Answer: B)
