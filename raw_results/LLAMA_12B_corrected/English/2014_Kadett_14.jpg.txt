Reasoning: To find the area of one of the rectangles, we need to divide the total area of the larger square into equal parts. The larger square has an area of 24^2 = 576 cm^2. The dimensions of the smaller rectangles are given as 12 cm x 2cm, 16 cm x 4cm, 18 cm x 6cm, 24 cm x 8cm, and 32 cm x 16cm. The total length of these smaller rectangles is 12 + 16 + 18 + 24 + 32 = 102 cm, which is equal to the length of the larger square. Therefore, the area of each rectangle is equal to the total area of the square divided by the number of rectangles. Area of each rectangle = 576 cm^2 / 5 = 115.2 cm^2

Answer: D) 115.2
