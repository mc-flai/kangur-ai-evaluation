Reasoning: The problem describes an ant Tanti starting at a vertex of a cube and wanting to walk along each edge at least once before returning to the starting point. The question asks for the minimum possible length of her walk. A cube has 12 edges, and Tanti must walk along each edge at least once. The minimum possible length can be calculated by finding the shortest path that covers all 12 edges. This is achieved by walking along the edges in a way that visits each edge only once before returning to the starting point. From the given options, the answer is 20, as it represents a suitable distance for covering all 12 edges of the cube while ensuring each edge is walked at least once.
Answer: E)
