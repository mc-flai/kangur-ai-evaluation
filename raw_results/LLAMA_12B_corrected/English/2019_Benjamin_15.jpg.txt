Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the steps involved in folding and cutting a square piece of paper. Bridget starts with a square piece of paper and folds it in half twice, then cuts it along the two lines she drew in the picture. The correct way to obtain the given squares is by folding the paper and then cutting it along the lines drawn. Now, let's analyze the options: A) This option shows that the paper is folded in half once, but the third step shows that the paper is not cut along the fold line, which is incorrect. B) This option also shows that the paper is folded in half once, but the third step shows that the paper is cut along the fold line, which is correct. C) This option shows that the paper is folded in half once, but the third step shows that the paper is not cut along the fold line, which is incorrect. D) This option shows that the paper is folded in half once, but the third step shows that the paper is not cut along the fold line, which is incorrect. E) This option does not show the correct sequence of folding and cutting the paper. Therefore, the correct answer is **B)**.  
Answer: B)
