Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to use the concept of similarity in triangles. **Given data:** *   Rectangle PQRS *   T is the midpoint of RS *   QT is normal to the diagonal PR **Step-by-Step Solution:** *   Since T is the midpoint of RS, RT = TS. *   The diagonal PR bisects the rectangle into two congruent triangles, ΔPQT and ΔPRT. *   These triangles are similar by Angle-Angle (AA) similarity because they share an angle at P and both have a right angle. *   In similar triangles, corresponding sides are proportional. Let's denote the length of the shorter leg of the right triangle (QP or QT) as x and the longer leg (PR or QR) as 2x. *   Since QT is normal to PR, it creates a right angle with PR. This makes ΔPQT a right triangle where QT = x, PR = 2x, and PQ = √(x^2 + (2x)^2) by the Pythagorean theorem. The ratio of the lengths PQ : QR can be determined by the similarity of the triangles. PQ / QT = PT / QR Since PT = TR and TR = RS by midpoint T, we know that PT = x. Therefore, we have PQ / QT = PT / QR = x / QR. Since PQ = √(x^2 + (2x)^2), dividing this by x gives us the ratio: PQ : QT = √(x^2 + 4x^2) : x = √5x : x = √5 : 1 So, the ratio of the lengths PQ : QT is √5 : 1.
