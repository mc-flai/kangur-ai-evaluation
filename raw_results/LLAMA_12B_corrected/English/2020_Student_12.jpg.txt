Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints and options provided. **Step 1: Understand the problem constraints** * Each movement turns exactly three coins. * The goal is to turn all the coins such that they face up. **Step 2: Analyze the initial setup** * Two thousand and twenty coins are on a table. * The "head" facing up orientation is specified. **Step 3: Consider the number of moves needed** * The minimum number of moves to turn all coins faced up will be determined by the minimum number of times three coins need to be flipped. **Step 4: Evaluate the options** * Options A), B), C), and D) suggest different numbers of moves, but without specific details, it's not possible to determine the exact number of moves required from these options alone. **Step 5: Eliminate options based on logic** * Given that there are 2,020 coins and each move flips three coins, the minimum number of moves should closely relate to the number of coins but might not perfectly align due to the nature of the question and potential mistakes in provided options. **Conclusion** * Since option E) It is not possible to make all the "tales" faces up violates the problem statement (as "tales" is mentioned instead of "tales," assuming it meant "tales" or "tales" referring to "tales" is contradictory), we interpret the intention here as seeking an answer indicating an error in the question's phrasing or logic provided in option E.
