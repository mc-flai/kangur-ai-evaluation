Reasoning: To determine the lengths of the rubber bands related to each other in question 16, we need to analyze the given situation. The problem states that Jack wants to keep six tubes each of diameter 2 cm together using a rubber band. He chooses between two possible variations shown. We are asked how are the lengths of the rubber bands related to each other. Let's break down the information given: The diameter of the tubes is 2 cm. There are six tubes in each arrangement. The rubber bands are used to hold the tubes together. Now, let's examine each option: **Option A**: Both pictures show the rubber band as π cm shorter. This means that regardless of the arrangement chosen by Jack, the rubber band will always be π cm shorter. **Option B**: The left picture shows the rubber band as 4 cm shorter, while the right picture does not indicate any change. This option only considers the left picture's arrangement and does not provide information about the right picture. **Option C**: This option directly states that in the right picture, the band is π cm shorter without mentioning the left picture. **Option D**: Similar to Option B, this option only considers the left picture and does not provide information about the right picture. **Option E**: Both bands are equally long in this option does not specify the relationship between the left and right pictures. Given the explanations above, we can conclude that the correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A)
