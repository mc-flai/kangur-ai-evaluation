Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of each shape and how they relate to five-digit numbers. We are given five options (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) corresponding to different arrangements of the shapes. Hammer (34426) and Bubble (34526) do not differ in the last digit, as they are exactly half of a complete cycle in their cycles. Shovel (32446) and Bubble (34526) have exactly one difference in the last digits. Therefore, Shovel (32446) + Bubble (34526) should not differ in the first digit. Repair does not differ from the first digit from the fourth digit from the third digit, as it represents 1 quarter of a cycle. Shovel is 4 more than the kind of repair. Thus, Shovel (32446) + Repair (23449) = 33446. If they differ only once, in the first digit, we then go for the one with the greater title (Paint) + Spades = ((23 in Paint) + (1)) = 24 ventures the careers: (25522). An inference from the rules stating the shells have one or four becomes (25522) = (24) Unk. No paint for 32514.
