Reasoning: 

To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of numbers in Mosif's table and how it changes when a single number is replaced. 

*   The table has rows and columns where adding the numbers in each row and column should result in the same total if the mistake is corrected.
*   Looking at the options provided:

    *   (A) 1: This option is incorrect because if we replace 1 with any other number in a specific position, the sum of the other numbers in the row or column will change.
    *   (B) 3: Similarly, replacing 3 with any other number would disrupt the balance across the rows and columns.
    *   (C) one of the two 4s: If one of the twos 4s is replaced, the sums in the respective row or column would no longer be the same, making this an incorrect choice.
    *   (D) 5: Replacing 5 would also upset the balance in the sums for any row or column.
    *   (E) one of the two 7s: Since 7 appears twice, replacing either instance would create an imbalance, ruling this out as the correct answer.
