Reasoning: The question is asking how many 3-digit-numbers can be formed using only the digits 1, 3, and 5, where the digits are divisible by 5. To be divisible by 5, the number must end in either 0 or 5. Since the given digits are 1, 3, and 5, any combination that ends in 5 is divisible by 5. There are two positions to fill before the last digit (hundreds and tens place). For each position, there are two choices (1 or 3). Therefore, the total number of combinations is 2 * 2 = 4. There are no additional constraints mentioned in the question. Based on the provided logic, the correct answer is: A) 4. This option represents the number of 3-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 1, 3, and 5, where the numbers are divisible by 5 with any repetition of digits.  
Answer: A)
