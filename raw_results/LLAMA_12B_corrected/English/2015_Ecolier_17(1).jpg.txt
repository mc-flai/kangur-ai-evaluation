Reasoning: To determine the number of small triangles Luca will get when he cuts the shape in figure 1, we need to carefully analyze the given shape and how it can be divided into equally sized small triangles.

Step 1: Count the number of vertices in the shape. The shape has 7 vertices.

Step 2: Identify any lines that can be drawn through these vertices to create smaller triangles. We can see that there are 4 lines that can be drawn to divide the shape into small triangles.

Step 3: For each line drawn in step 2, determine how many small triangles it will create. Each line creates 2 small triangles.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of small triangles by multiplying the number of lines by the number of small triangles each line creates. The total number of small triangles is 4 lines * 2 small triangles per line = 8 small triangles.

Step 5: However, we need to check if any of these small triangles are not equally sized. Upon closer inspection, we can see that one of these triangles is already drawn on figure 1, so it is not part of the count.

Therefore, the correct answer is A) 8.

Answer: A)
