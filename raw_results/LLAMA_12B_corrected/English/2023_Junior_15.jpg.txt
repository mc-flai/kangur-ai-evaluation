Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of an equilateral triangle and the properties of isosceles triangles. An equilateral triangle has all three sides of equal length, while an isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length. Given that the pentagon ABCDE is split into four triangles with the same perimeter, we can deduce the following: The perimeter of the pentagon is divided equally among the four triangles. Since all the triangles have the same perimeter, each triangle must have a shorter side equal to half of the shortest side of the other triangles. Now, let's analyze the options: Option A: 3/2 - This option suggests that the ratio of the perimeter of the pentagon ABCDE to the perimeter of the triangle ABC is 3/2. This is not possible since the perimeter of the pentagon would be greater than the perimeter of the triangle ABC if the triangles are isosceles. Option B: 4/3 - This option also doesn't make sense as it would imply that the triangles have different perimeters. Option C: 5/3 - This is a viable option since the pentagon would have 5 sides, and if we divide the perimeter in a specific ratio, we might get 5/3 as a possible ratio. Option D: 5/2 - This option implies that the pentagon has twice the perimeter of each triangle, which contradicts our initial assumption that the perimeter is split equally among the triangles. Option E: 5/2 - This option suggests that the ratio of the perimeter of the pentagon ABCDE to the perimeter of the triangle ABC is 5/2. This is not possible since it would imply that the triangles have different perimeters.
