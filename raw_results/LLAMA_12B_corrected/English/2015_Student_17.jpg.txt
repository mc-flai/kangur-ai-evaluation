Reasoning: 

To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of ratio and percentages. 

Let's break down the information given in question 17:

1. The population of Arnberg has increased by 40% in the past 20 years.
2. The population of Berghausen has increased by 60% in the same time span.
3. The total population of the two villages has increased by 54%.

We are asked to find the ratio of the populations 20 years ago. 

Let's denote the original population of Arnberg as A and the original population of Berghausen as B.

We know that the population of Arnberg increased by 40%, so the current population of Arnberg is 1.4A.

Similarly, the population of Berghausen increased by 60%, so the current population of Berghausen is 1.6B.

The total population of the two villages increased by 54%, so the current total population is 1.54(A + B).

Now, let's use the fact that the sum of the parts is equal to the whole. Since we want to find the ratio of the populations 20 years ago, we can set up the equation:

1.4A + 1.6B = 1.54(A + B)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.14A = 0.06B

Dividing both sides by B, we get:

A/B = 0.6/0.14

A/B = 6/7

So, the ratio of the populations 20 years ago is 6:7.
