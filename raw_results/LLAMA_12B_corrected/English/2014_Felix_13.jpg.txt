Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the shapes and find the one that cannot be made by cutting the given square into four pieces. The question asks us to identify which shape cannot be created from these four pieces.

First, let's understand the constraints:

*   The square can only be cut into four pieces.
*   Each piece must be a shape.
*   The shapes must be connected to each other.
*   No piece can overlap or be incomplete.

Now, let's analyze the options:

*   A) A diamond cannot be made by cutting a square into four pieces because it requires two separate triangles.
*   B) A triangle can be made by cutting a square into four pieces. This is because a square can be divided into two right-angled triangles.
*   C) An arrowhead shape can be made by cutting a square into four pieces. This is because an arrowhead can be formed by combining two triangles.
*   D) A pair of connected triangles can be made by cutting a square into four pieces. This is because a square can be divided into two triangles.
*   E) A kite shape can be made by cutting a square into four pieces. This is because a kite can be formed by combining two triangles.

Based on the analysis, all options A), B), C), D), and E) are possible except for A), as explained above.

Answer: A)
