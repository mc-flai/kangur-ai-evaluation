Reasoning: The kangaroo is moving in a grid pattern, but it has a rule that it can only move through adjacent squares separated by a water stream. 1.  **Option (A)**: The path up, up, then left, left does not work because the kangaroo would need to spend one move in the second grid adjacent to the water, but this path forces it to move right into the water immediately. 2.  **Option (B)**: This option works: starting to the right, then up, and then up to pass the streams. 3.  **Option (C)**: This option does not work because the kangaroo needs to go up to the adjacent grid square in order to jump over the stream - it cannot go left from that square. 4.  **Option (D)**: This option does not work because, like Option (C), it tries to take the left instead of the right. 5.  **Option (E)**: This option does not work because, like the others, it tries to bypass and move in the water. Although problem 10 gives a hint that "Carl" would write a five-digit number made of arrow symbols (down - three rights, three lefts), the logic rules for problem 1 focus entirely on the need to avoid a four-digit number by controlling the flip-flop that rotates output from the three right to three lefts movements.

Answer: B)
