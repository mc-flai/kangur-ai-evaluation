Reasoning: The question asks to find the lowest possible value for the sum $S$ of four integer numbers and product 9. The task is to determine which of the given options represents this lowest possible value. The options provided are: A) -18, B) -12, C) -8, D) 0, E) 6. To find the lowest possible value for $S$, we need to consider how the product of 9 and the sum of four integer numbers can be minimized. The product of 9 implies that at least one of the numbers must be a factor of 9, which could be 1, 3, 9, or a combination thereof. Evaluating each option: Option A) -18 does not guarantee a sum that includes a number that is a factor of 9. Option B) -12 also does not guarantee a sum that includes a number that is a factor of 9. Option C) -8 does not ensure a sum with a factor of 9. Option D) 0 might work if the other three numbers have a sum that compensates for the product of 9. Option E) 6 does not guarantee a sum with a factor of 9. Considering the need for at least one of the numbers in the sum to be a factor of 9 to minimize the sum itself, option D) 0 seems the most plausible. With one number being 0, the other three numbers could sum up in a way that, when multiplied by 9, equals the desired lowest possible sum for $S$. Thus, option D) 0 stands out as the correct answer.

Answer: D)
