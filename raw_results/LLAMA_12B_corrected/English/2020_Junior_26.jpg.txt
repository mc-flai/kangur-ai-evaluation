Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the given information and the process that Pedro used to disassemble the cube. Pedro assembled a cube using 64 little white equal cubes and then he painted the cube red. Then he dismantled the cube and reassembled it so that all its faces were white and painted the cube red again. The question asks how many white faces of little cubes remained white after this process. Let's break down the process: 1. Pedro started with a cube made of 64 little white equal cubes. 2. He painted the entire cube red. 3. Then, he dismantled the cube and reassembled it so that all its faces were white. 4. Finally, he painted the entire cube red again. Since all the faces of the cube were white, this means that no matter how many times Pedro painted the cube red, the white faces would still be white. Therefore, the number of white faces of little cubes that remained white is equal to the total number of faces on the cube. A standard cube has 6 faces, so the answer is:

Answer: B) 72
