Reasoning: 

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the weight of fresh mushrooms and their dried weight. We are told that from 4 kg of fresh mushrooms, Konrad gets 1 kg of dried mushrooms.

This means that for every 4 kg of fresh mushrooms, he gets 1 kg of dried mushrooms. To find out how many kilograms of mushrooms he has to pick in order to receive 4 kg of dried mushrooms, we can use this conversion factor.

Let's set up a proportion:

1 kg (dried) = 4 kg (fresh)

We want to find out how many kilograms of fresh mushrooms are needed to get 4 kg of dried mushrooms. We can set up another proportion:

x kg (fresh) = 4 kg (dried)

Now, we can use the conversion factor to solve for x:

x kg (fresh) = 4 kg (dried) Ã— (4 kg (fresh) / 1 kg (dried))

x kg (fresh) = 16 kg (fresh)

So, Konrad needs to pick **16 kg** of fresh mushrooms in order to receive 4 kg of dried mushrooms.

Answer: B) 16 kg
