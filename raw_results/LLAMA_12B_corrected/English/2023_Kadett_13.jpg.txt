**Reasoning:**

To determine the minimum number of red edges on a cube, we need to consider its structure. A cube has six faces, each with four edges, making a total of 12 edges. To identify which edges should be colored red, we can examine the options provided. Options A, B, and D suggest coloring all the edges except those at the corners, which would leave 4 red edges. Option C proposes coloring all the edges at the corners and no interior edges, resulting in 8 red edges. Option E suggests coloring all the edges except the ones that connect two opposite faces, which is not possible since there are no such edges on a cube. Therefore, the minimum number of red edges is **4**.

**Answer: A), B), D)**
