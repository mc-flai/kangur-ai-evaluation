Reasoning: 

To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of scale models in model railways. A scale model is a representation of a real-world object that is smaller than the actual size. The scale of a model is typically expressed as a ratio, with the first number referring to the length of the model in relation to the length of the actual object.

In this case, the question states that the HO-scale 1:87 model railways use. This means that 1 unit on the model represents 87 units in reality.

We are given the height of Benjamin's brother as 1.74 meters (m) and asked to find his height in reality. To do this, we can set up a proportion using the scale ratio:

HO-scale (1:87) = True-scale (1:x)

where x is the height of Benjamin's brother in reality.

We know that 1 unit on the model represents 87 units in reality, so:

1/87 = 1.74/m

To find the height in reality, we can multiply both sides by x:

1/x = 1.74/m

Now, we can solve for x:

x = m/1.74

Using a calculator, we get:

x â‰ˆ 5.06

This means that the height of Benjamin's brother in reality is approximately 5.06 meters.
