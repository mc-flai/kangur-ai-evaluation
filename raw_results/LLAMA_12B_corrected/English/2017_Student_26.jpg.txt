Reasoning: To determine the highest probability of winning, we need to analyze the distribution of balls in each box to maximize our chances. If we put one white and one black ball into each box, there are nine equally likely outcomes for Anna's draw. Since there is only one way Anna can win (drawing the last remaining white ball), the probability of winning with this strategy is 1/9. With three black balls and two white balls in one box and two black balls and three white balls in the remaining eight boxes, the probability of drawing the last remaining white ball is 2/9. This is because if the first box is chosen, Anna wins with a probability of 2/3 since there are two white balls in the box. If any other box is chosen, Anna loses. When four black balls are placed into one box and all the remaining white balls are placed into the remaining box, the probability of Anna winning is 4/9. This is because if the box with all black balls is chosen, Anna loses, and if the other box is chosen, Anna wins with a probability of 4/3 since all the remaining white balls are in this box. If all white balls are placed in one box and all black balls are placed in the other box, the probability of Anna winning is 1/9. This is because if Anna chooses the box with all white balls, she will win. If all black balls are placed in one box and one white ball is placed in each of the remaining eight boxes, the probability of Anna winning is 8/9. This is because if Anna chooses any box other than the one with all black balls, she will win. Considering these options, the highest probability of winning can be achieved by **Option C**, where we place four black balls in one box and all the white balls among the remaining boxes.
