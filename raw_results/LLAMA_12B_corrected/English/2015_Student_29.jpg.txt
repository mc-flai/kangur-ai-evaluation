Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of numbers that the members of the counting club are using. They start with 1, 2, 3, etc., and each person says the next number in turn. If a member of the club says an even number, they step out of the circle. Let's analyze the pattern: 1. The first person says 1 (odd). 2. The second person says 2 (even), and they step out. 3. The third person says 3 (odd), and the pattern continues. 4. When the 15th person says 29 (odd), they will step out because 29 is odd. 5. The 16th person says 30 (even), and they step out. 6. The 17th person says 31 (odd), and so on. Now, let's consider the sequence of numbers being said by the members: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 29, 30, 31, 32, ... Notice that every 6th number is even (2, 8, 16, ...), and the rest are odd. Since the person from Bill wants to say a number between 1 and 96, we need to find an even number that fits this criterion. Considering the sequence and the fact that the even numbers are said every 6th time, we can see that there are only 16 even numbers in the list: 2, 8, 14, 20, ..., 94. Therefore, the correct answer is: **B) 20**

Answer: B)
