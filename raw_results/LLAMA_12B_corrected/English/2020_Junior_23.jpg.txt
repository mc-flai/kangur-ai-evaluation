Reasoning: To find the overlapping area of the folded parts, we need to calculate the area of one of the triangles created by the fold and then subtract that area from the total area of the rectangle. The total area of the rectangle is $12 \text{ cm} \times 20 \text{ cm} = 240 \text{ cm}^2$. Since the fold creates two congruent triangles, each with a base of 12 cm and a height of 12 cm (because the fold is along the 20 cm diagonal, which means the height of the triangle is half of the diagonal), the area of one triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ cm} \times 12 \text{ cm} = 72 \text{ cm}^2$. Therefore, the overlapping area of the folded parts is $240 \text{ cm}^2 - 2 \times 72 \text{ cm}^2 = 96 \text{ cm}^2$. So, the correct answer is **C) 48 cm2**.

Answer: C) 48 cm2
