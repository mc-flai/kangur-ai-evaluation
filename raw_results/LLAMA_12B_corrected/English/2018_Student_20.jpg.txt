Reasoning: To find the value of angle α, we can utilize the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. We have a right-angled triangle with one angle measuring 30 degrees and the other angle measuring 90 degrees (since it's a right-angled triangle). Let's denote the angle opposite the side of length 12 as α. Using the property that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees, we can set up an equation to solve for angle α: α + 30° + 90° = 180°. Simplifying the equation: α = 180° - 120° = 60°.
