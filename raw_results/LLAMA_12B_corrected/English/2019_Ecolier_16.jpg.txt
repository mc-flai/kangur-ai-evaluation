Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the image and understand what is being asked. The question states that the pictures show how much 2 pieces of fruit cost altogether. We are given five options: A) 150 g, B) 200 g, C) 225 g, D) 250 g, E) 300 g. Looking at the pictures, we can see that there are two types of fruit: apples and pears. Each piece of fruit has a different weight: 8 taler for the apple and 9 taler for the pear. Let's calculate the total weight of the fruit: Apple: 8 taler, Pear: 9 taler. Total weight = 8 + 9 = 17 tater. However, we need to convert the weight from tater to grams. Since 1 tater is equal to 100 grams, we can convert the total weight as follows: Total weight (in grams) = 17 tater x 100 grams/tater = 1700 grams. None of the given options match the calculated total weight of 1700 grams. Therefore, the correct answer is: None of the above. This means that the correct answer is not among the options A), B), C), D), or E). However, based on the given data and calculations, we can conclude that the total weight of the fruit is 1700 grams, but this is not among the given options.
