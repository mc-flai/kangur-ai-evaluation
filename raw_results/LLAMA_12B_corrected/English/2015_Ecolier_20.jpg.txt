Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of matching shapes and identifying patterns. Analyzing the Options: A) is incorrect because it does not show a single large loop. Instead, it includes three identical pieces with different orientations. B) is incorrect as it also does not feature a single large loop. The figure depicts two overlapping squares, which does not meet the criteria. C) is incorrect because it displays a picture with four loops that vary in size, not a single large loop as asked. D) is correct because it presents one large loop that matches the criteria of the question. The figure consists of three identical pieces, and upon closer inspection, we see that only one of these pieces features a single large loop. E) is incorrect because, similar to option A, it includes three identical pieces with different orientations but lacks a single large loop. Conclusion: Given the task of finding a piece that shows a single large loop among the identical pieces, the correct answer is (D). This is because option D matches the specific request of displaying a single large loop among identical pieces, unlike the other options that fail to fulfill this criterion or feature additional patterns.

Answer: D)
