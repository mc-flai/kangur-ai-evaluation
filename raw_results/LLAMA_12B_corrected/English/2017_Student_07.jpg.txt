Reasoning: To determine which cuboids can be built entirely out of 4 x 1 x 1 blocks, we need to consider the dimensions and the orientation of the blocks. Cuboid A has dimensions of 4 x 2 x 1. This means it requires a combination of 1 block of 4 x 1 x 1 and 2 blocks of 1 x 1 x 1. Since the blocks are available, cuboid A can be built entirely. Cuboid B has dimensions of 4 x 1 x 1. It requires 4 blocks of 1 x 1 x 1, which are available. Therefore, cuboid B can also be built entirely. Cuboid C has dimensions of 4 x 1 x 1. Similar to cuboid B, it requires 4 blocks of 1 x 1 x 1, which are available. Thus, cuboid C can be built entirely as well. Cuboid D has dimensions of 3 x 1 x 1 and 1 x 1 x 1. Since both blocks have dimensions that match the requirements for one or more sides of the cuboids, we can find blocks of these sizes. For example, we can use two blocks of 4 x 1 x 1 to get the 3 x 1 side and one block for the 1 x 1 side. Therefore, cuboid D can also be built entirely. However, cuboid E has dimensions of 2 x 2 x 1. While we have blocks of these sizes available, they do not perfectly match since the 2 x 2 side cannot be made from a single larger block, nor can the 1 x 1 side from a larger block. This means cuboid E cannot be built entirely using the given blocks. The correct answer is that cuboids A, B, C are the only ones that can be built entirely out of 4 x 1 x 1 blocks because they have dimensions that directly match or can be formed by combining available blocks. Cuboid D can also be constructed because it can be formed by appropriately combining blocks of other dimensions that match or are similar to its sides. Ultimately, cuboid E cannot be built due to the inability to match its required dimensions exactly from the available blocks.
