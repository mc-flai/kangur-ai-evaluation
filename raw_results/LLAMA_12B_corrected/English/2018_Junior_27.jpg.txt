Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of space diagonals in a cube and the symmetry properties of such figures. A cube has 4 space diagonals. There are 3 perpendicular planes that cut through a space diagonal of a cube, dividing it into two halves of equal length. One plane will pass through the center of the cube. The remaining (completely symmetrical) figure after cutting one plane and then the other is a square (option C). This is because when we cut the cube in half along one of the space diagonals, the remaining figure will have 4 lines of symmetry and a square shape. Therefore, the correct answer is **C).**

Answer: C)
