Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of permutations and combinations. The problem states that there are 21 knights who always tell the truth and 2000 knaves who always lie. A wizard divided 2020 of these 2021 people into 1010 pairs. The key information here is that each pair described the other person as either a knight or a knave. This means that if a person A is paired with person B, then person A's statement about person B's nature (whether they are a knight or a knave) will always be true. We know that there are 2020 people in total, and they are divided into 1010 pairs. This means that there are 2020 - 1010 = 1010 individuals who are left out of these pairs. Since each pair has one knight and one knave, the number of pairs of knights is half the number of pairs of people, which is 1010 / 2 = 505 pairs of knights. Therefore, the number of pairs of two knaves is also 505, as pairs consist of one knight and one knave. 

Answer: B) 985
