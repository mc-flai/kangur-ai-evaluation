Reasoning: To determine which cube Julia drew, we need to consider the ways in which a cube can be folded and glued from a square piece of paper. A cube has six faces, each with the same dimensions, and all its edges are equal in length.

1. **Identify the key characteristics:** The correct cube will have each face with dots arranged in a pattern that reflects the symmetry of a cube.

2. **Examine the options:**
   - **A):** This cube has four dots per face, arranged symmetrically across each face, matching the symmetry of a cube.
   - **B):** This cube does not maintain symmetry across all faces; for example, if you rotate it, some faces wouldn't look the same.
   - **C):** Similar to B), it lacks the necessary symmetry across its faces.
   - **D):** This one exhibits symmetry across all faces, making it a plausible candidate.
   - **E):** Despite appearing to maintain some form of symmetry, upon closer inspection, it fails to meet the balanced pattern that would be characteristic of a cube made from a square.

3. **Conclusion:** Given these observations, the correct answer is the cube that maintains perfect symmetry across all its faces when rotated in any way similar to how you would manipulate a real cube.

Answer: A)
