Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to replace the letters in the given equation such that the equation remains true. The equation is $N \times U \times (M + B + E + R) = 33$, where each letter represents a different digit between 0 and 9 (inclusive). We are asked to find the number of ways to replace the letters with different digits while keeping the equation valid. Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. The product of two numbers is always equal to or less than the maximum value of either number. 2. Since $33$ is the product, the maximum value of either $N$ or $U$ must be less than or equal to $33$. **Step 2: Analyze Each Case** We have five cases to consider: **Case A:** * If $N=1$ and $U=3$, then $M+B+E+R=11$. * If $N=3$ and $U=1$, then $M+B+E+R=11$. * If $N=3$ and $U=3$, then $M+B+E+R=3.33$, which is not a valid solution. Cother fitall solution choices as there exist values of $M,B,E$, and $R$ between 0 and 9 that satisfy the cases. In summary, the equation $N \times U \times (M + B + E + R) = 33$ can be replaced by different digits in three ways: * ($N,U$) = (1,3) and ($M,B,E,R$) = (2,4,5,8) or (3,2,4,5) or (3,4,2,5) * ($N,U$) = (2,3) and ($P,Q,R,S$) = (1,0,2,10) or (2,0,1,10) or (3,0,1,2) Therefore, the correct answer is E).
