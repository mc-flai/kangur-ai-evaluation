Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the problem and find the correct answer from the given options. The problem describes a pyramid with multiple fields where shapes are drawn. We are asked to identify which shape Tina draws into an empty field of the bottom row. To solve this problem, we can analyze the shapes drawn in each field of the top and middle rows. We can see that the shapes are interlocking and repeating in a pattern. Looking at the pattern, we can see that the shape in the empty field of the bottom row is a triangle. The pattern of interlocking shapes in the pyramid indicates that each shape in the top and middle rows corresponds to a specific shape in the bottom row. By analyzing the pattern, we can determine that the shape in the empty field of the bottom row is a triangle.

Answer: B) Triangle
