Reasoning: To solve question 11, we need to understand the concept of building blocks with equal cubes glued face to face. The question asks for the smallest number of cubes used in such a construction. Building blocks with equal cubes glued face to face involve stacking cubes on top of each other, with each cube having the same size and shape. This means that all the cubes are identical, and the only variation is in their orientation. To determine the smallest number of cubes used, we need to consider the minimum number of cubes required to form a structure with a specific shape. In this case, the shape is a pyramid with a square base. A pyramid with a square base requires at least 4 cubes to form the base, 3 cubes to form the upper layer, and 2 cubes to form the apex. Therefore, the minimum number of cubes needed is 4 + 3 + 2 = 9. Based on the calculation, the smallest number of cubes used is 9.
Answer: A) 9
