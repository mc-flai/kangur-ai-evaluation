Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between the black-and-white caterpillar and its rolled-up form.

The caterpillar starts in a straight line along the bottom of the diagram. Each time it sleeps, it rolls over and wakes up facing the right instead of the left. This transformation affects its color pattern.

When the caterpillar is rolled up, some white dots may be on top of black dots or vice versa. However, because of how the caterpillar turns, if a black dot is on top of another black dot in the rolled-up version, then in the next row, it must end up under a white dot in the previous row due to the caterpillar turning to face right instead of left.

In the given diagram, observe that:
- All white dots are singly placed.
- Black dots are always in pairs (except for the first dot and the last dot).
- The sequence alternates between the two pairs of black dots being in one direction (e.g., right and right) then the other direction (left and left), which corresponds to the alternating row directions of the groupings before the caterpillar rolls up.

Given this pattern, we realize that every row of dots, when grouped, provides a combination lock with one group always white and the adjacent group having a black dot followed by a white dot if it follows a white group in the sequence after rolling up, or vice versa if it precedes a white group when considering the turning pattern of the caterpillar.

Considering the pattern of alternating sequences of black and white pairs when grouped and then applying the rolling mechanism (turning from left to right),   **Option B)** corresponds to this pattern. 
It follows the growth and transformation rule, where an initial white dot is sandwiched between two pairs of black dots.

The final answer is Option B).

Answer: B)
