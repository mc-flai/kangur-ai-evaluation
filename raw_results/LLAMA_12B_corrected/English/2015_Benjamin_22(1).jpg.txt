Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the layout of a train with 12 carriages. The given information tells us that in each carriage there is the same number of compartments, and that there are 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12 compartments in respectively the 7th, 3rd, 18th, 50th, and 12th carriages. From this information, we can deduce that the carriages do not just increment in number of compartments linearly. Instead, every carriage number seems to follow a specific pattern: - 7th carriage has 7 compartments - 3rd carriage has 8 compartments - 18th carriage has 9 compartments - 50th carriage has 10 compartments. This pattern increases the number of compartments by 1 for every third carriage, starting from the 3rd carriage. Given the options: (A) 7 compartments in the 7th carriage (B) 8 compartments in the 3rd carriage (C) 9 compartments in the 18th carriage (D) 10 compartments in the 50th carriage (E) 12 compartments. The only option that matches this pattern perfectly is (B) 8 compartments in the 3rd carriage because it follows the sequence where every third carriage increases the compartment count.

Answer: B)
