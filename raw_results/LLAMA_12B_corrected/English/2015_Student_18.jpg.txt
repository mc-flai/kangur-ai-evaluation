Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the probabilities of both Bibi and Tina winning. For Bibi to roll a number higher than Bibi, she must roll 4, 5, 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of Bibi winning is: 

\[ P(\text{Bibi wins}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Now, let's analyze the question. The problem states that if Tina rolls a higher number than Bibi, she wins. Therefore, Tina's winning probability is complementary to Bibi's winning probability. We can calculate Tina's winning probability as follows: 

\[ P(\text{Tina wins}) = 1 - P(\text{Bibi wins}) = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \]

However, this is not among the given options. The closest value is $\frac{1}{3}$. 

\[ P(\text{Tina wins}) = \frac{1}{3} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is **B) $\frac{7}{18}$.**  
Answer: B)
