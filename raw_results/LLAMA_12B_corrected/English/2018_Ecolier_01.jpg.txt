Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the movement of the darts and how they hit the balloons. Each dart is fired with the same force and in the same direction, but they have slightly different trajectories due to slight variations in the angle of incidence.

When the darts hit a balloon, they burst it if their velocity is sufficient to cause the balloon to rupture. The number of balloons hit by the darts depends on the number of darts and their trajectories relative to each balloon.

Given that there are three darts flying towards nine fixed balloons, and each dart bursts the balloon it hits, we can assume that each dart will hit at least one balloon. However, since the question asks for the number of balloons hit by the darts, not the number of balloons burst by each individual dart, we need to consider the combined effect of all three darts.

If we look at the options provided:

(A) 2  
(B) 3  
(C) 4  
(D) 5  
(E) 6  

We should also consider the fact that the darts might hit different balloons or share some balloons. However, since there are only three darts and assuming each one hits at least one balloon:

* Option (A) 2 is too low because surely each of the three darts will hit a balloon.  
* Options (D) 5 and (E) 6 are too high because you cannot exceed the total number of balloons, which is 9 in this case, with only three darts.  

The most plausible scenario given the information is that the darts hit some of the balloons, leaving others untouched. Without specific details on the distribution of hits, the reasonable assumption would be that they hit a subset of the balloons but not all. Given the options and the assumption that each dart hits a balloon, the only options that seem reasonable (considering there are multiple darts but not all must hit contact) are:

(B) 3  
(C) 4  

Answer: B)
