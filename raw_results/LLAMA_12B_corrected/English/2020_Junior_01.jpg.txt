Reasoning: The question asks to determine the sum of numbers in a specific middle position of a sequence of sums. In this problem, options are provided in descending order, and the middle is asked. For working with sums, we'll write two sets of numbers to analyze, {5, 2, 9, 7} and {7, 9, 5, 2}. When arranging numbers in descending order, even and odd numbers are odd sums, and odd numbers can be in the middle. In the case of this problem, {7, 7} in descending order and {7, 5} and {5, 2} give odd sums which can be the middle value. The correct answer is D) 12 + 34 + 45 because after summing the second and third sets (7 and 5 + 2), the value equals the 3rd option.
Answer: D)
