Reasoning: The question describes a scenario where a bus and a car are both traveling between the airport and the city center. The bus takes 60 minutes for the journey, while the car only takes 35 minutes. Every three minutes, a bus is leaving the airport to drive to the city center. A car leaves the airport at the same time as a bus and travels the same route as the bus to the city center. We need to find out how many buses the car overtakes on its way to the city center. To do this, we can calculate the number of buses that start at the same time as the car and do not count as buses overtaken. The car takes 35 minutes to reach the city center, while the bus takes 60 minutes. Since every three minutes, a bus is leaving the airport, there are 60 / 3 = 20 buses that start at the airport before the car leaves. Therefore, the car overtakes 20 buses on its way to the city center. Based on our calculation, the correct answer is C) 10.
Answer: C)
