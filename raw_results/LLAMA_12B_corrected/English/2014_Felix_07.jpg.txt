Reasoning: To determine the number of circles that the kangaroo is inside, we need to analyze the given figure. The kangaroo is located at the center of three overlapping circles. A. 1: This option suggests that the kangaroo is only inside one circle. However, based on the figure, it is clear that the kangaroo is inside more than one circle. B. 2: This option indicates that the kangaroo is inside two circles. While the kangaroo is inside at least two circles, there are actually three circles overlapping. C. 3: This option correctly states that the kangaroo is inside three circles. The figure shows that the kangaroo is indeed at the center of these three overlapping circles. D. 4: This option implies that the kangaroo is inside four circles, but there are only three circles visible in the figure. E. 5: This option suggests that the kangaroo is inside five circles, which is not supported by the provided figure. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Answer: C)
