Reasoning: To determine who broke the window pane, we can eliminate options using the information provided in the question:

*   **Analyzing the Statements**

    *   Maria: "It was Peter."
    *   Peter: "It was Richard."
    *   Richard: "It wasn't me."

*   **Eliminating the Statements**

    *   Since Peter contradicts Maria's statement, one of them is lying. If Peter is telling the truth, then Maria is lying and it is Richard who broke the window pane.
    *   The only statement that does not contradict another is Richard's. Therefore, Richard is not lying, and it was either Peter or Maria who broke the window pane.

*   **Conclusion**

    Given the contradictions between Maria and Peter, and the consistency of Richard's statement, we can conclude that either Peter or Maria broke the window pane.
