Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of cubes removed and the remaining structure's stability. The structure consists of a 5x5x5 cube with some 1x1x1 cubes removed, leaving behind several equally high pillars. We are asked to find the number of little cubes that have been removed. Let's consider each option and determine its feasibility: (A) 56, (B) 60, (C) 64, (D) 68, (E) 80. We can eliminate option (E) because the total number of small cubes in the original 5x5x5 cube is 125. Removing 80 cubes would leave only 45 cubes, which cannot form pillars that are equally high. We can also eliminate option (D) because removing 68 cubes would result in fewer than 57 pillars, making it impossible to maintain the structure's height. After eliminating options (E) and (D), we are left with options (A), (B), and (C). To confirm our answer, let's analyze the structure: If one removes 56 cubes from a 5x5x5 cube, you obtain the solid shown. This option matches the description in the question. The final answer is (A) 56.

Answer: A)
