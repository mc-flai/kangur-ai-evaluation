Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of closed loops on a cuboid's surface. A closed loop is a path that starts and ends at the same point on the surface. Let's analyze each option: *   **Option A**: This option shows a path that starts on one side of the cuboid and ends on the opposite side, creating a closed loop. *   **Option B**: This option depicts a path that starts on one side of the cuboid, traverses through the interior, and ends on the other side, forming a closed loop. *   **Option C**: This option illustrates a path that starts and ends at the same point on the surface, resulting in a closed loop. *   **Option D**: This option shows a path that does not form a closed loop because it ends at a different point from where it started. *   **Option E**: This option also does not form a closed loop as it ends at a distinct point from where it began. Based on these analyses, the correct answers are those that depict closed loops on the cuboid's surface, which are:
