Reasoning: To determine the weight of each white ball, we must consider that all the balls of the same color have the same weight. The question involves finding the weight of a white ball, which is represented by options A), B), C), D), and E). In order to find the weight of each ball, we need matching white ball, black ball, and gray ball. Matching colors: [6, 14]. Matching colors: [6, 10, 7, 14]. Matching colors: [6, 14]. The correct answer is A) 6 kg, B) 14 kg, and C) 7 kg. This solution removes options D) and E) because there are not enough matching colors; therefore, options D) and E) can be eliminated from the possible answer choices. Based on the calculations, it can be concluded that the weight of each ball is 6 kg. The three answer choices A) no, B) no, and C) yes be chosen from the or together.  
Answer: No Answer.
