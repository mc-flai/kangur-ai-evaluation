Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of conditional probability. The problem states that there are 9 kangaroos called the Greatkangs, and they can be either white or black. We are asked to find the probability that none of them is white, given that exactly two-thirds of them are black.

First, let's define some variables:

*   Let W be the event that a kangaroo is white.
*   Let B be the event that a kangaroo is black.

We know that there are 9 kangaroos in total, and we want to find the probability that none of them is white, which means all of them are black. Since there are 3 black kangaroos and 6 white kangaroos, the probability of a kangaroo being black is 3/9 = 1/3, and the probability of a kangaroo being white is 6/9 = 2/3.

The probability of all 9 kangaroos being black (i.e., none of them is white) is (1/3)^9.

Since the question asks for the probability that none of them is white, given that exactly two-thirds of them are black, we need to find the conditional probability P(None white | Exactly Two-Thirds Black).

However, since we already know that the probability of a kangaroo being black is 1/3, and the question asks for the probability that none of them is white, given the same condition (exactly two-thirds being black), we can directly calculate the probability as follows:

P(None white | Exactly Two-Thirds Black) = P(None white)

This is because the condition "Exactly Two-Thirds Black" does not provide any new information about the color of the remaining kangaroos. Therefore, the probability remains the same, which is (1/3)^9.

Among the answer choices, the one that asks for the number of Greatkangs that are black is not directly asked in the question. However, based on our calculation, we can determine that the correct answer choice corresponds to the number of black kangaroos.
