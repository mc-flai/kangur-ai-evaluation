Reasoning: To answer this question, we need to analyze the images provided and identify which one best represents a 4-point tear of Captain Jack's map. A 4-point tear is characterized by four distinct points where the piece of the map has torn off. Each option (A through E) shows a different configuration of torn-off pieces. Option A shows a scenario with two small tears on one side of the map, which meets the criteria for a 4-point tear. Options B, C, D, and E either show only one tear or two small tears that do not meet the criteria for a 4-point tear. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is Option A.

Answer: A)
