Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the pattern of holding hands among the children. The task is to determine in how many places the two children are holding each other with their left hands. The children are arranged in a circular manner. Each child is holding the hands of two other children. In a circular arrangement, each child has a specific number of neighbors to their left and right. When examining the circular arrangement, we observe that each child must hold the hands of their left neighbor and the child two positions to their right, who is also their left neighbor. This pattern continues around the circle. Given this understanding, we can deduce that there are only two distinct configurations where two children hold each other by the left hand: One child's left hand is holding another child's right hand, and this child's right hand is holding a third child's left hand.
