Reasoning: To solve this problem, we can use the concept of the perpendicular bisector theorem and similar triangles. The problem states that an equilateral triangle XYZ has the same perimeter as the triangle ABC. We are given the side lengths of the triangle ABC as 6 cm, 10 cm, and 11 cm. Since the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is also the sum of its side lengths, we can find it by adding the side lengths of triangle ABC. 

Perimeter = side length 1 + side length 2 + side length 3 = 6 cm + 10 cm + 11 cm = 27 cm. 

Since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, we can divide the perimeter by 3 to find the length of each side: Side length = Perimeter / 3 = 27 cm / 3 = 9 cm. 

Now, let's check which answer choices result in an equilateral triangle with a side length of 9 cm: (A) 6 cm × 2 = 12 cm (not 9 cm), (B) 9 cm × 2 = 18 cm (not 9 cm), (C) 10 cm × 2 = 20 cm (not 9 cm), (D) 11 cm × 2 = 22 cm (not 9 cm), (E) 27 cm / 3 = 9 cm (correct). 

Based on the calculation, we can see that the side lengths of the triangle XYZ should be equal to 9 cm for it to be indeed an equilateral triangle and have the same perimeter as the triangle ABC, which is 27 cm.

Answer: E)
