Reasoning: To solve question 17, we need to understand the concept of probability and how it relates to drawing a ball from the box without replacing it. The problem states that there are five balls in a box, four of which contain chocolate, and one contains a boiled sweet. We are asked to find the probability that Maria wins by drawing a ball from the box. The probability of an event is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is drawing the ball containing the boiled sweet, and the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of balls in the box. Since there is only one ball containing the boiled sweet out of the five balls in the box, the probability of Maria winning is: Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes = 1 / 5 = 0.2. Now, let's compare our calculated probability to the given options: Option A: 2/5, Option B: 3/5, Option C: 1/2, Option D: 5/6, Option E: 1/3. Our calculated probability matches option A: **2/5**. The thought process involved calculating the probability using the correct formula and comparing it to the given options.

Answer: A)
