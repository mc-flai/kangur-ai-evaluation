Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of how the product of three numbers that are connected by a straight line is the same in all three cases. The diagram shows seven pairwise different single-digit numbers distributed among the circles. The question asks us to find the number written in the circle with the question mark. The numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 are given in the options as possible answers. Let's analyze each option: 

*   **Option A (2):** If the question mark is filled with 2, then the products of the three numbers connected by straight lines would be 2 * 3 * 4 = 24, 2 * 6 * ? = ?, and 2 * ? * 8 = ?. This option does not satisfy the condition that the product of the three numbers connected by straight lines is the same in all three cases. 
*   **Option B (3):** If the question mark is filled with 3, then the products of the three numbers connected by straight lines would be 2 * 3 * 4 = 24, 3 * 6 * 8 = 144, and 4 * 6 * ? = ?. This option does not satisfy the condition that the product of the three numbers connected by straight lines is the same in all three cases. 
*   **Option C (4):** If the question mark is filled with 4, then the products of the three numbers connected by straight lines would be 2 * 3 * 4 = 24, 6 * 4 * 8 = 192, and 6 * ? * ? = ?. This option does not satisfy the condition that the product of the three numbers connected by straight lines is the same in all three cases. 
*   **Option D (6):** If the question mark is filled with 6, then the products of the three numbers connected by straight lines would be 2 * 3 * 4 = 24, 6 * 3 * 8 = 144, and 6 * 4 * 8 = 192. This option satisfies the condition that the product of the three numbers connected by straight lines is the same in all three cases. 
*   **Option E (8):** If the question mark is filled with 8, then the products of the three numbers connected by straight lines would be 2 * 3 * 4.
