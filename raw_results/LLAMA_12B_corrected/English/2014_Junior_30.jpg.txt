Reasoning: To find the area of the quadrilateral AFDE in cm$^2$, we need to identify the properties of each shape and apply geometric principles to calculate the area. The figure contains two congruent right triangles to the left of the mid-point line, each with legs of 6 cm and 8 cm. These triangles are symmetric and share a common base of 6 cm with an aligned point of intersection at the midpoint. All sides except the hypotenuse (8 cm) have equal lengths, making this a 45-45-90 triangle. Each leg is 6 cm, meaning the full length of the hypotenuse (8 cm) has a ratio constant when calculating the ratio of the hypotenuse with the length of each leg (x). By multiplying the ratio constant $1.414$ by $12$ cm, the hypotenuse measures $8 cm$ on the left side of the intersecting mid-point. Square (GDME) connects right side AD, given that the midpoint of line E is equal toegment using discovery. Using the properties of square (AEFG) to isolate GI and the lengths of triangle (AGI). Square: length GI is the side, therefore EG is its persistence height of pyramid of standard. The part of EQ gives you the basis for calculating the perimeter called the mode length is $a+b+c-de*f$ known as the basis side EG calculates height as 4]=6 by rotation. Since the square (AF) is perfectly equal, AG is constant in the length. The sum total of RF as equal height DP A[70xJI from their rounding.
