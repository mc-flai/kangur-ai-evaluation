Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the given angles in the figure. The angles labeled a, b, c, d, and e are formed by a square and an equilateral triangle. The first condition to check is whether the angles are equal or not. Since the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal, angle c equals angle d. Next, we need to verify if the other conditions hold true. If angle b plus angle c is less than angle a, then option C is incorrect. Checking the value of angle a and the sum of angles b and c, we see that angle a is equal to angle b plus angle c, which confirms option D. Therefore, the correct answer is option D). 
Answer: D)
