Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to find the combination of three coins from the options (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) that can buy a fruit using exactly five coins. We are given the prices of different fruits in the diagrams on the right side of the page.

Let's analyze each option:

**(A) 1,30**

This option consists of 1 coin of 1,30 value. To buy a fruit using exactly five coins, we would need more than one coin of this denomination, as it only has one coin.

**(B) 1,35**

This option consists of 1 coin of 1,35 value. Like option (A), it only has one coin, so it's not possible to use this option to buy a fruit with exactly five coins.

**(C) 1,40**

This option consists of 1 coin of 1,40 value. The same issue arises as with options (A) and (B); it only has one coin.

**(D) 1,55**

This option consists of 1 coin of 1,55 value. Again, it only has one coin.

**(E) 1,75**

This option consists of 4 coins (25c, 25c, 10c, and 5c). Let's calculate the total value:

25c + 25c = 50c  
50c + 10c = 60c  
60c + 5c = 65c  

The total value is 65c, which is not what we need. However, if we consider using 3 coins from option (E), we can get:

25c + 25c = 50c  
50c + 10c = 60c  

We still have 5 cents left, which can be made up by adding 1 coin totaling 5c.

This combination uses exactly five coins (4 from one coin and 1 from another) and totals 1,60.

However, this doesn't seem to be the correct answer based on the problem statement. Let's reevaluate our thought process. Since the total cost of buying a fruit using exactly three coins is 1,60, let's find another combination of coins from the options:

25c + 25c = 50c  
60c + 10c = 70c - 10c = 60c and 5c left  

We have four combinations
