Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the pattern of point marking on a straight line. The problem states that some points are marked on a straight line and that another point is marked between every pair of adjacent points. The process is repeated three more times. Let's analyze the situation: Initially, there are 29 points on the straight line. After the first round of marking, a new point is added between each pair of adjacent points. This means that for each pair of points (e.g., A and B), a new point is added (C). Therefore, the number of points doubles after the first round (29 * 2 = 58 points). After the second round, another point is added between each pair of adjacent points. This means that for each pair of points (e.g., A and C), a new point is added (B). Since there are 58 points after the first round, the number of points will double again (58 * 2 = 116 points). After the third round, another point is added between each pair of adjacent points. This means that for each pair of points (e.g., A and B), a new point is added (C). Since there are 116 points after the second round, the number of points will double again (116 * 2 = 232 points). After the fourth round, another point is added between each pair of adjacent points. This means that for each pair of points (e.g., A and B), a new point is added (C). Since there are 232 points after the third round, the number of points will double again (232 * 2 = 464 points). Now, we are asked how many points were there to begin with. Based on the above analysis, we can see that the number of points at the end of the fourth round (464) is two times the initial number of points plus 2 (because two too many points are added with each pass). Therefore, we can set up the equation: 464 = 2x + 2. Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us: 462 = 2x. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: x = 231. However, this is the wrong approach. Let's try again. From the first step to the second step, we observed that the number of points doubles. This doubling pattern continues every time a point is added between each pair. Considering the given options, only option **225** matches the doubling pattern observed from start to.
