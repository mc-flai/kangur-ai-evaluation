Reasoning: To determine which cars will crash into each other, we need to analyze the movement of each car based on the information provided in the diagram. The arrows indicate the direction and time taken by each car to cover a certain distance. Since the cars move at a constant speed, the distance traveled is proportional to the time taken.

The critical insight here is that cars moving in different directions will collide if they meet at any point. We can observe that:

*   Car 1 moves diagonally down from left to right.
*   Car 2 also moves diagonally down but starts from a position above and to the right of car 1.
*   Car 3 moves diagonally up from right to left.
*   Car 4 moves diagonally up from right to left, starting above and to the left of car 3.

Given this information, we can deduce the following:

*   Cars 1 and 2 will never meet since they move in different directions over the same path.
*   Cars 1 and 3 will meet when 1 is at its bottom-right position, as car 3 crosses over car 1's path at that point.
*   Cars 1 and 4 will never meet due to their different paths.
*   Cars 2 and 3 are not on the same path initially, but as car 3 crosses over, it follows a path that could potentially intersect with car 2's path later on.
*   Cars 2 and 4 move in perpendicular directions, so they cannot collide unless one changes direction or they intersect at a later time which is not indicated.

Considering these deductions, the only pair of cars that can definitely collide based on the path and direction shown is **cars 1 and 3**. This means the correct answer is:

Answer: C) 1 and 3
