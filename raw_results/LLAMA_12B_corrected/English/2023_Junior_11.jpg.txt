**Reasoning:**

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between reducing water usage and shower time or water pressure. Jennifer wants to save water by reducing one quarter of the water usage and water pressure.

### Reducing Water Pressure

If Jennifer reduces the water pressure by one quarter, it means that she reduces the amount of water flowing out of the showerhead by one quarter. This reduction is applied uniformly across all factors affecting water usage, including the flow rate (related to pressure) and the duration of the shower.

### Reduction in Time

If she reduces the time she takes a shower by one quarter, it means that she reduces the duration of the shower by 25%. However, this reduction primarily affects the water usage in terms of volume because the flow rate remains constant during the less time-consuming shower.

### Combining the Effects

When considering both changes together, we must note that reducing water pressure affects the flow rate, but reducing shower time directly impacts total water usage by affecting the volume of water used over time. The combined effect doesn't simply add up because the water flow rate's impact on the water usage is different from the straightforward volume reduction from shorter shower times.

### Estimating the Impact

The specific fraction representing the total reduction in water usage due to both parts isn't directly calculable without knowing the exact initial conditions (pressure and initial shower time). However, we can infer that the reduction in water usage will be more than just a simple sum of each individual reduction's impact because they are related but not identical effects on water usage.

### Conclusion

Given the explanation above and without explicit numbers or rates provided to calculate the exact reduction, we can deduce that the correct answer won't be simply adding 1/4 + 1/4, but rather considering how these reductions interact. The key is recognizing that reducing both by a quarter could indeed amount to more than a single quarter total reduction because of their interconnected systemic impacts.
