Reasoning: To determine which tower is the tallest, we need to compare their heights. The pink tower is described as "taller than the red tower but shorter than the green tower," and the silver tower is said to be "taller than the green tower." This information allows us to create a vertical order of the towers: pink < green < silver. Since the silver tower is taller than the green tower, it must also be taller than the pink tower. Therefore, the correct order of tower heights from shortest to tallest is: pink < red < green < silver.
