Reasoning: The geometric mean of $n$ numbers is defined as the $n$th root of the product of all $n$ numbers. Let's calculate the geometric mean of six numbers:

$$\sqrt[n]{x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdots x_6}$$

We are given that the geometric mean of three of them is 3 and the geometric mean of the other three is 12.

Let's denote the three numbers with a geometric mean of 3 as $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$, and the three numbers with a geometric mean of 12 as $x_4$, $x_5$, and $x_6$.

The geometric mean of $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ is 3, so we can write:

$$\sqrt[3]{x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdot x_3} = 3$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdot x_3 = 3^3 = 27$$

Similarly, the geometric mean of $x_4$, $x_5$, and $x_6$ is 12, so we can write:

$$\sqrt[3]{x_4 \cdot x_5 \cdot x_6} = 12$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$x_4 \cdot x_5 \cdot x_6 = 12^3 = 1728$$

Now, let's calculate the product of all six numbers:

$$x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdot x_3 \cdot x_4 \cdot x_5 \cdot x_6 = 27 \cdot 1728 = 46656$$

Taking the sixth root of both sides, we get:

$$\sqrt[6]{x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdot x_3 \cdot x_4 \cdot x_5 \cdot x_6} = \sqrt[6]{46656}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\sqrt[6]{46656} = \boxed{9}$$

Therefore, the geometric mean of all six numbers is 9.
