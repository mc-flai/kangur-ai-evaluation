Reasoning: 

To solve this problem, we need to understand the given information and use basic arithmetic.

1.  45 teachers at Anna's school come to school by bike.
2.  Only 12% of the teachers come to school by car.

From the given information:

*   Total number of teachers = 45
*   Number of teachers who come to school by bike = 60% of the total number of teachers
*   Number of teachers who come to school by car = 12% of the total number of teachers

Let's calculate the number of teachers who come to school by car:

Number of teachers who come to school by car = 12% of the total number of teachers

= 0.12 * Total number of teachers

= 0.12 * 45

= 5.4

Since the number of teachers must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number:

= 5

However, this answer is not among the options provided. Therefore, we need to reconsider our calculation or understand that maybe I made an incorrect assumption or calculation. If there's an error in the initial explanation, or if I failed to identify additional details not explicitly mentioned in the initial instructions, it's without realizing - if I knew what those specific numbers were - it wouldn't hinder my response's provision before that point.
