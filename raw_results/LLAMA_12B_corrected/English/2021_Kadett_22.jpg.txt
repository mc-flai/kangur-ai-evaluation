Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the given information and how it relates to the original fraction. The original fraction is not provided in the question, but we are given that the numerator and denominator are both positive. Initially, the numerator of the fraction is increased by 40%. This means that if the original numerator was 'x', the new numerator would be '1.4x' (since a 40% increase is equivalent to multiplying by 1.4). Next, the problem states that the new fraction is double the original fraction. This implies that the ratio of the new fraction to the original fraction is 2:1 or 2/1. Let's denote the original denominator as 'y'. The original fraction can be represented as 'x/y'. When the numerator is increased by 40%, the new fraction becomes '1.4x/y'. Since the new fraction is double the original fraction, we can set up the following equation: (1.4x/y) = 2(x/y). Simplifying the equation, we get: 1.4 = 2. This is not possible, as 1.4 is not equal to 2. It seems there was an error in interpreting the problem statement. However, re-reading the instructions again: - "The numerator of this fraction is increased by 40%" - "By what percentage should its denominator be decreased so that the new fraction is double the original fraction" The denominator not increased or changed. The numerator increases by 40% and that makes the fraction double because the increase is greater than 50%. Since the original fraction is not provided, we cannot calculate the exact numbers. But based on the given information, if the numerator is increased by 40%, the fraction will be double. To achieve this, the denominator needs to decrease. Given this understanding, the correct answer is 50%. Therefore, the remembered answer is 50%, which is option E.).
