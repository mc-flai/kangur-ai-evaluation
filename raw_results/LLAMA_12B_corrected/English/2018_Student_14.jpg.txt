Reasoning: To find the volume of the octahedron, we use the formula for the volume of an octahedron:

$$
\begin{aligned}
V &= \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{2}(side)^3
\end{aligned}
$$

Given that the side length of the octahedron is 1, we can plug this value into the formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
V &= \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{2}(1)^3 \\
&= \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{2} \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

The calculated volume is $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}$. Let's compare it with the given answer options:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Option A: } \frac{1}{3} \sim \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3},\\
\text{Option B: } \frac{1}{4} < \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3},\\
\text{Option C: } \frac{1}{5} < \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3},\\
\text{Option D: } \frac{1}{6} < \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3},\\
\text{Option E: } \frac{1}{8} < \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Based on the comparison, it is evident that the calculated volume $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}$ matches with option A, which is approximately equal to $\frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, the correct answer is **option A**.
