Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the question carefully. The question states that Florian has 10 equally long metal strips with equally many holes and asks which of the long strips is the shortest. The diagram shows five different configurations of the metal strips, labeled A, B, C, D, and E. To find the shortest strip, we need to look for the configuration that uses the fewest number of strips. Option A shows a configuration that uses two strips. Option B also shows a configuration that uses two strips. Option C shows a configuration that uses three strips. Option D shows a configuration that uses three strips. Option E shows a configuration that uses four strips. Since the question asks for the shortest strip, we need to choose the configuration that uses the fewest number of strips. The correct answer is A) or B). Both options A and B show configurations that use the fewest number of strips, which is two. Therefore, they are both correct answers.

Answer: A), B)
