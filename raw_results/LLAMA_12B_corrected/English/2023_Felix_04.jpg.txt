Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the arrangement of shapes and identify the missing piece. The image shows a kangaroo formed by combining four shapes (A, B, C, D). Each part of the kangaroo is represented by a unique shape: a square head, a triangular body, and a tail. The problem states that Mr. Beaver re-arranges the parts to build a kangaroo. We are given five options for which part is missing: A), B), C), D), or E). Upon examining the image, we notice that the kangaroo is formed by combining the four shapes in a specific order. The square head is on top, followed by the triangular body, and then the tail. * Analyze the arrangement of shapes in the image. * Identify the missing part by comparing the given options with the actual kangaroo structure. * Determine the correct answer based on the positioning of the shapes.

Answer: C)
