Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the movement of the train and how it relates to the stations on the track. The train starts at station A and moves in the opposite direction of the track until it reaches the end of the line or F. Then, it returns to station A again. Since the train starts its journey in station B, we can deduce that the train will pass through all the stations on the track (A, B, C, D, E, and F) before returning to station A. Therefore, if the train conductor starts his journey in station B, he will be at his 46th stop when he reaches station C. 

Answer: A) D
