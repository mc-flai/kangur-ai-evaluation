Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between the weights of the kangaroos and the overall group's weight. The two lightest ones weigh 25% of the total weight, while the three heaviest ones weigh 60% of the total weight.

Let's denote:
- The total weight of the whole group as $T$.
- The weight of the two lightest kangaroos as $L$, which is 25% of $T$, so $L = 0.25T$.
- The weight of the three heaviest kangaroos as $H$, which is 60% of $T$, so $H = 0.60T$.

We are asked to determine how many kangaroos are in the group, so let's establish equations based on the given information:

1. **Equation for the total weight of the group:** The total weight of all kangaroos in the group is equal to $T$.

2. **Equation for the lightest kangaroos' weight:** The two lightest kangaroos make up 25% of the total weight. We don't know their individual weights or the distribution between them.

3. **Equation for the heaviest kangaroos' weight:** The three heaviest kangaroos make up 60% of the total weight. Similar to the lightest, we don't know their individual weights or distribution.

However, we're not provided with direct quantitative information about individual weights or their distribution in the given options. Instead, we're asked to consider the scenario and select an appropriate option based on logical deduction from the given percentages.

Given that we don't have sufficient information to directly calculate the number of kangaroos from the percentages provided (25% for the two lightest and 60% for the three heaviest), and without being able to make assumptions based on a detailed distribution of the weights published in the options, a precise mathematical solution cannot be directly provided here under these constraints.

But, the question seems to be about understanding the proportional weight distribution rather than the actual count of kangaroos. Since options aren't directly calculable from the given data without specific details about how many kangaroos are in each condition (lightest, heaviest), I'll note the structure of the solution approach rather than an explicit numerical answer:

*   Recognize the percentage breakdowns of total weight among the kangaroos.

However, without explicit weight values, thorough mathematical analysis to derive the exact number from given.
