Reasoning: To solve question 3, we need to determine the number of real solutions for the equation $2^{2x}=4^{x+1}$. 

**Step 1: Simplify the equation** 
We can simplify the equation by expressing both sides with the same base: 

$2^{2x}=(2^2)^{x+1}$ 

$2^{2x}=2^{2x+2}$ 

**Step 2: Equate the exponents** 
Since the bases are equal, we can equate the exponents: 

$2x=2x+2$ 

**Step 3: Solve for x** 
Subtracting $2x$ from both sides gives us: 

$0=2$ 

This is a contradiction, so there are no real solutions for the equation $2^{2x}=4^{x+1}$.
