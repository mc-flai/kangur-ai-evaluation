Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the statement in question 7. The statement states that "Everybody has solved more than 20 problems." This implies that at least one person has solved 21 or more problems.

Option A states that "Nobody has solved more than 20 problems," which contradicts the original statement. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

Option B states that "Somebody has solved less than 21 problems." This does not necessarily mean that someone has not solved more than 20 problems. It only implies that someone may have solved less than 21 problems, but it does not rule out the possibility of someone solving more than 20 problems. Therefore, option B is also incorrect.

Option C states that "Everybody has solved less than 21 problems." This statement only rules out the possibility of someone solving 21 or more problems, but it does not guarantee that everyone has solved less than 21 problems. Therefore, option C is incorrect.

Option D states that "Somebody has solved exactly 20 problems." This implies that at least one person has solved exactly 20 problems, but it does not rule out the possibility of someone solving more than 20 problems. Therefore, option D is also incorrect.

Option E states that "Somebody has solved more than 20 problems." This statement is consistent with the original statement, as it implies that at least one person has solved more than 20 problems. Therefore, option E is the correct answer.

The correct answer is option E because it is the only option that is consistent with the original statement. The other options either contradict or do not guarantee that someone has solved more than 20 problems.

Answer: E)
