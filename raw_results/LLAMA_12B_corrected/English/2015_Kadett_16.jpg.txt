Reasoning: To determine the total number of leaves on the bush, we must calculate the total number of leaves based on the given condition that each twig has either 5 leaves or 2 leaves and a flower. The problem states that there are **10 twigs**. We can have a combination of 5 leaves per twig or 2 leaves and a flower per twig for the total number of leaves on the bush. If all twigs have 5 leaves each, the total number of leaves will be **10 x 5 = 50 leaves**. If all twigs have 2 leaves and 1 flower each, the total number of leaves will be **10 x 2 = 20 leaves**. We can have a mix of 5 leaves and 2 leaves with a flower for each twig. The possible combinations include (5, 0), (4, 1), (3, 2), (2, 3), (1, 4), and (0, 5). For each combination, the total number of trees with this combination is 10. The total number of leaves on the bush will be either 50 or 20, depending on which combination we choose. Converting from leaves to numbers gives us the possible numbers of leaves on the bush, which are 50, 27, 29, 31, 39, and 45 (from (0, 5) to (5, 0) respectively). The only possible number of leaves on the bush that can also be formed from converting any combination of the above that are as equal as possible would be histories 17's numbers can be solved as follows; | Hist‌ories | # Lea‌ves | Twigs| Total# Trees on the bush | |---------------------|-----------|-------|---------------------| | (0,5) | 45 | 5 | 14| | (1,4) | 39 | 9 | 14| | (2,3) | 31 | 3 | 6 | | (3,2) | 27
