Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the given conditions and constraints. The problem states that Kate has four flowers, each with a different number of petals: 6, 7, 8, and 11 petals. She tears off one petal from each flower until it is no longer possible to tear off one petal from each of three different flowers. The goal is to find the minimum number of petals left over. Let's analyze the situation step by step: If Kate tears off one petal from each of three flowers with 6, 7, and 8 petals, she will be left with 5 petals from each flower. Since she cannot tear off one petal from each of three different flowers, she must have at least 2 petals remaining after removing one petal from each of three flowers. Therefore, the minimum number of petals left over is 2.

Answer: B) 2
