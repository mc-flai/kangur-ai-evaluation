Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of numbers in a 3 x 3 table. The information given is: * Nine whole numbers were written into the cells of a 3 x 3 table. * The sum of these nine numbers is 500. * The numbers in two adjacent cells (with a common sideline) differ by exactly 1. Let's denote the numbers in the cells as follows: * Top-left: a * Top-center: b * Top-right: c * Middle-left: d * Middle-center: e * Middle-right: f * Bottom-left: g * Bottom-center: h * Bottom-right: i. We know that the numbers in two adjacent cells differ by exactly 1. This means that the differences between the numbers in each row and column are all 1. For example, if a = x, then b = x + 1, and c = x + 2. Similarly, if d = y, then e = y + 1, and f = y + 2. Since the sum of all nine numbers is 500, we can write an equation: a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i = 500. Simplifying the equation, we get: 3(a + d) + 3(b + e) + 3(c + f) + (g + h + i) = 500. Since the numbers in each row and column differ by exactly 1, we can substitute the expressions for b, c, e, f, g, h, and i in terms of a, d, b, e: 3(a + d) + 3(a + 1 + d + 1) + 3(a + 2 + d + 2) + (a - 2 + d + 3 + a - 1 = 500. Combine like terms: 9a + 9d - 3 = 500. Divide by 9: a + d = 55. This means that the sum of the numbers in the top-left and middle-left cells is 55. Now, we can use the fact that the numbers in two adjacent cells differ by exactly 1 to find the sum of the numbers in the bottom-left and bottom-center cells: g + h = 45. Similarly, the sum of the numbers in the bottom-center and bottom-right cells is 47: h + i = 46.
