Reasoning: To find the perimeter of the grey area, we need to find the total length of all the internal arcs touching the given circle. Each pair of overlapping circles forms a sector arc which contributes to the perimeter. The sectors alternate with their centers along the perimeter of the circles' composite, resulting in the total length of their corresponding segment being the same. Thus, if each pair of overlapping circles contributes equally to the total perimeter, we only need to calculate the length of the arc and its supplements twice, as there are two groups of circles: p = (2 * ∑πr / 2) + (2 * ∑πr) This simplifies to: p = (2 * πr) + (2 * πr) p = (4 * πr) Given that circumference equals πd or 2πr, substituting πd or 2πr in place of the πr above gives us: p = 4 * (5/2) p = 10 Considering that the answer choices are incomplete lengths of the perimeter in the format "a.eans", using option (A) (210).

Answer: A)
