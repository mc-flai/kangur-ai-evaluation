Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of the factorial function and its pattern. The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. In this case, we are given 15!=15 ⋅ 14 ⋅ 13 ⋅ ... ⋅ 2 ⋅ 1 and asked to find the two missing digits. Let's first calculate 15. Since 15 = 3 × 5, there are only two factors missing in the product. We need to find the two digits that are not present in the product. The product of the first 14 positive integers is: 14!= 14 × 13 × ... × 2 × 1 = (1 × 2 × ... × 14). Now, let's analyze the factors of 15: • 3: This factor is already present in the product (except for the factor 3 itself). • 5: This factor is not present in the product (except for the factor 1). • Other factors: All other factors of 15 are already present in the product. Since 3 and 5 are the only factors missing from the product, the two missing digits must be 3 and 5. Therefore, the correct answer is: **C) 3 and 5**.
