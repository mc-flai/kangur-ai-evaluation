Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of integers between 2 and 11 (inclusive) that are not divisible by any of the integers from 2 to 11 except two.

We can start by listing all the integers from 2 to 11:

2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11

Next, we need to find the multiples of each of these integers:

* Multiples of 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
* Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9
* Multiples of 4: 4, 8
* Multiples of 5: 5, 10
* Multiples of 6: 6
* Multiples of 7: 7
* Multiples of 8: 8
* Multiples of 9: 9
* Multiples of 10: 10
* Multiples of 11: 11

Now, we can count the number of integers that are multiples of two or more integers from 2 to 11:

* Multiples of 2 and/or 4: 4, 6, 8, 10
* Multiples of 2 and/or 5: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
* Multiples of 2 and/or 6: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
* Multiples of 2 and/or 7: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
* Multiples of 2 and/or 8: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
* Multiples of 2 and/or 9: 0
* Multiples of 2 and/or 10: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
* Multiples of 2 and/or 11: 0

Note that some integers are counted multiple times, so we need to subtract them:

* Counted twice: 3, 6, 9, 10
* Counted three times: 8

Now, we can subtract the counted integers from the total number of integers to get the number of exception:

24 - 3 = 12â€‹- 6 = 6 - 6
