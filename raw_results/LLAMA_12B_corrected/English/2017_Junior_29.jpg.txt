Reasoning: To determine the possible distributions of the 106-gram weight, we need to consider the equilibrium position of the beam. For a beam balance, the weights are placed on opposite sides of the fulcrum (pivot point). The fulcrum is located at the middle point between the two trays. To balance the scale, the weights on each side must have the same moment about the fulcrum. Let's assume that the weight distribution satisfies the equation: \[W_1 \times d_1 = W_2 \times d_2\] where $W_1$ and $W_2$ are the masses of the weights on each tray, and $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the distances from the fulcrum to the weights on each tray. Given the masses and the fact that the beam is balanced, there are only two possible distributions of weight: One weight is on each tray ($x$). One weight is 56 grams and the other is 151 grams on one tray. To ensure a balance, the 151-gram weight must be on Track $X$, and the 56-gram weight must be on Track $Y$.
