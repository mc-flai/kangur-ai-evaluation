Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the given information and the conditions provided. The question states that there are 40% more girls than boys in a class. Additionally, it mentions that a student representative team of two students randomly selected from this class is made up of exactly one girl and one boy, and one boy is exactly $\frac{1}{2}$. Let's denote the number of boys as B and the number of girls as G. According to the problem: - The probability of selecting one girl and one boy from a team of two students is $\frac{G}{T} \times \frac{B}{T}$, where T is the total number of students. - This probability is given as exactly $\frac{1}{2}$. Given that there are 40% more girls than boys, we can express this relationship as: $$ G = B + 0.4B = 1.4B $$ The probability of selecting one girl and one boy is given by: $$ \frac{G}{T} \times \frac{B}{T} = \frac{1.4B}{T} \times \frac{B}{T} = \frac{1.4B^2}{T^2} $$ This probability is also stated to be $\frac{1}{2}$, leading to the equation: $$ \frac{1.4B^2}{T^2} = \frac{1}{2} $$ To find the number of children, we need to solve these equations together. However, solving them directly leads to complex calculations involving the total number of students (T) and expressing B in terms of T or vice versa. Given the specific format of the answer choices and the nature of the question, it's likely that the key information or direct calculations involving the number of students aren't what the question is seeking. Responding based on the need for simplicity and the unexpected nature of the combined solution, we would typically rely on the relationship between boys and girls (with 40% more girls than boys) and the probability of mixed teams. However, without direct values or equations that involve calculating or combining in a straightforward manner, we must shift our approach to fit the given answer format. Considering the original setup and without direct calculation potential provided in the question or steps leading to specific numbers fitting neatly into the format given, we should recognize there seems to be a misunderstanding in the pathway typically taken for such problems. The initial framework provides
