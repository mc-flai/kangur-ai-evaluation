Reasoning: To find the area of the square, we need to understand its relationship with the circle and the angle formed. A square is inscribed in the semicircle such that all four vertices touch the circle. The square's diagonal is equal to the diameter of the semicircle, which is $1 \text{ cm}$ (the given radius of the circle). The diagonal of the square divides it into two right-angled isosceles triangles. Each triangle has sides in a ratio of $1 : 1 : \sqrt{2}$ (from Pythagoras' theorem for an isosceles right-angled triangle). Thus, the side length of each triangle (and hence of the square) is $\frac{1 \text{ cm}}{\sqrt{2}}$. The area of a square is given by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the length of one side. So, the area of this square is $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \text{ cm}^2$.

Answer: C) $= 0.5 \text{ cm}^2$.
