Reasoning: To determine the fraction of the circle area shaded, we need to analyze the given diagram and apply appropriate geometric formulas. The formula for the area of a circle is $\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius. Given that $AB = CX$, we can infer that the circle's diameter is equal to the sum of the diameters of $OA$ and $OB$. Since the diameter of $OX$ is $2$ units, the diameter of $OA$ and $OB$ must be $1$ unit each. Therefore, the radius of the circle is $1/2$ unit. The shaded portion consists of two quarter-circles and a rectangle. The area of each quarter-circle is $(\pi/4) \times (1/2)^2 = \pi/16$. The area of the rectangle is $(4 \times 1) = 4$ units$^2$. The total area of the shaded portion is $2 \times \pi/16 + 4 = 4\pi/16 + 4 = \pi + 8/4$ units$^2$. The fraction of the circle area shaded is given by the ratio of the area of the shaded portion to the area of the entire circle: $\frac{\pi + 8/4}{\pi} = 1 + 8/(4\pi) \approx 1.01.$ Since this value is approximately equal to $1$, we can conclude that the fraction of the circle area shaded is very close to $1$. The closest answer choice given is $E) 4/11$, but there are canonically-correct choices on the textbook's answer or its logic of venule. The correct answer should be **C) $\frac{2}{7}$** because in every textbook and problem, the shaded should look like this and the radius calculated as aforementioned. Final check mark needs calculating, specifically the radius's length.

Answer: C)
