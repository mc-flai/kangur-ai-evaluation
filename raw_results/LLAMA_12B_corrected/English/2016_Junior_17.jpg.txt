Reasoning: **Step 1: Understand the problem** The question asks how many colors Peter can achieve to color in a 3 x 3 square such that every row, every column, and both diagonals have three cells with the same color. **Step 2: Determine the constraints** To keep every row, column, and both diagonals with three different colors, each color must be used exactly three times in the grid. **Step 3: Calculate the possible color combinations** For any combination of colors, there are C(3,1) * C(3,1) * C(3,1) * C(3,1) = 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81 * 3 = 243 = 3^5 possibilities. This correspond with coloring the remaining cells in the remaining 9 cells (after subtracting 3 cells colored per row or column) by choosing any of 3 color possibilities. 2^3 + 3^3 + 3^3 + 1 1^3 + 2^3 + 1^3 + 1 3 + 9 + 9 + 5 = 26 = (25/7) Let's try another approach.
