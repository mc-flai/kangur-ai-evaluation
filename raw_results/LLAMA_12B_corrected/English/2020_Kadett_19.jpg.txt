Reasoning: To determine the smallest amount of cubes Irene may have used to make its assembly, we need to understand the spatial arrangement required for the "city" made using identical wooden cubes. The problem states that the view from above and the side view of the "city" are provided. Given that we can only see the top and one side of the structure, we can visualize possible configurations based on these views. The side view suggests a layered arrangement, while the top view implies a rectangular base. Understanding how these two views relate to each other is key to determining the minimum number of cubes required. Considering the configurations: *   **Configuration A**: This configuration doesn't seem feasible because it doesn't match either the side or top view descriptions. Thus, it's unlikely to be correct. *   **Configuration B**: This matches both views, showing a structure that can be built with 12 cubes, which could align with both the side and top views described. *   **Configuration C**, **D**, and **E** do not seem to match the given descriptions without further details on how they align with both views mentioned (top and side). Given the descriptions of the top and side views, the focus should be on finding a configuration that meets both descriptions with the least number of cubes. Configuration B exactly meets these criteria with a straightforward interpretation that fits both views. Therefore, based on the provided options and the analysis of the views, the correct answer is: **Answer: B)**.
