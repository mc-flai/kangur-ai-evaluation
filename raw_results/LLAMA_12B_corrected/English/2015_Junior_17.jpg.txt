Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of equivalent ratios and how they can be applied to identify equivalent-weighted objects. In a double balance, the objects' weights are compared by placing them on either side of a fulcrum. If the weights are equivalent, the scale is balanced. If one side has a greater weight, it will be pulled downwards, and if one side has a lesser weight, it will be pulled upwards. Given the diagram in question 17: • Object a is placed on both sides of the double balance. • Object b is placed on the left side of the double balance. • Object c is placed on the right side of the double balance. • Object d is placed on the top side of the double balance. The question asks which two objects were exchanged so that the position of the balance changed. To solve this problem, we can analyze each option: * Option A: a and b * If b is moved from the left side to the top side, the balance will shift upward because b is lighter than a. * The correct change of position is observed in Option B, where c is moved from the right side to the left side. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B.  
Answer: B)
