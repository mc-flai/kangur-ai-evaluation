Reasoning: 
*   Tortoise Eva has experienced a year in which three digits represent the same number for the third time.
*   Choose the minimum age that Tortoise Eva can be to satisfy this condition.
*   Recognize that Tortosis Eva must be at least as old as the year 2000, so she must be at least 22.
*   Eliminate answer choices A) 20, B) 22.
*   Use the year 3000 to find the least possible value of 3-digits for Tortoise Eva's age.
*   The smallest possible value of three digits that Tortoise Eva can be in the future is 3000.
*   The smallest possible age that Tortoisae Eva can be in the future is 43.
*   Identify the age at which tortoise Eva would be the same digits for the third time.
*   Tortoise Eva would be the same digits for the third time if Tortoise Eva is at least 33. 
*   That's because 3000 – 43 = 2957 and 500 + 44 = 544.
*   Answer the Wods combine Step 4 with Step 3.
*   Tortoise Eva would be at least 33 to be the same digits for the third time, so Tortoise Eva is at least 22; that means 33 – 22 = 11 years old.
*   Perform the evaluation of 11 – 22 without executing the remainder of the evaluation.
*   Because 11 is _less than 22_ and 22 – 11 = 11; that is, 11 is the difference of 33 – 22 in steps 3 and 4. Tortoise Eva must therefore be 33.

Answer: C) 23.
