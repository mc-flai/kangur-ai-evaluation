Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the symbols and how they are related to each other. The first symbol from the left is a picture of an eye. The symbol represents the number 1. The second symbol looks like a sun or a star. The symbol represents the number 7. The third symbol looks like an atom. The symbol represents the number 8. The fourth symbol looks like an infinity sign. The symbol represents the number 5. Using these representations, let's look at the equation: 20. The symbols / It is known that \(\diamondsuit+\bigodot=\bigodot\) stand for one of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. Which symbol stands for the digit 3? Let's break down each term: *   \(\diamondsuit\) can be replaced with a picture of an eye. Since the symbol represents the number 1, let's substitute it with 1. *   \(\bigodot\) can be replaced with a sun. Since the symbol represents the number 7, let's substitute it with 7. *   We want to find the value of X. By analyzing the symbols on both sides of the equation, we can deduce that X must result in an additional 7 (to equal the sum of 8 + 7). Now let's look at the options: (A) \(\bigodot\) = 7 (matches option A) (B) \(\bigodot\) = 8 (matches option B) (C) \(\bigodot\) = 4 (not possible) (D) \(\bigodot\) = 5 (not possible) (E) \(\bigodot\) = 2 (not possible) Based on our analysis, we can determine that the correct answer is (B). However, this doesn't tell us much. To better analyze this SOP, we should create individual SOP equations for each unmatched variable (like pounds). Let's break down option B: \(\diamondsuit + \diamondsuit + \bigodot = \bigodot\), therefore, X must be equal to 5. Adding it all together gives us \(\diamondsuit + X + \bigodot = \bigodot\). Let's go back to B's equation and replace X with 5 and \(\bigodot\) with 7. \(\bigodot + \bigodot\bigodot + \bigodot\)

Answer: B)
