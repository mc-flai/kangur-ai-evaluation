**Reasoning:**

To solve this problem, we need to understand the rules for correcting the word KANGAROO. The rules state that turning a letter twice can correct it, and turning letter A once can correct it.

We are given 8 cards with letters K, A, G, A, R, O, O, and O. Our goal is to read the word KANGAROO correctly.

Let's analyze the options:

(A) 4: If we turn only 4 cards, we might not be able to correct all the errors.

(B) 5: If we turn 5 cards, we can correct the A's, but we might still have an incorrect letter or two.

(C) 6: If we turn 6 cards, we can correct the errors, but we need to make sure that we are turning the right cards.

(D) 7: If we turn 7 cards, we can correct all the errors, as we have enough turns to fix the K, A, and O's.

(E) 8: If we turn 8 cards, we will definitely be able to correct all the errors, but it might not be the most efficient way.

Considering the rules and the number of cards, option (D) 7 seems to be the most efficient way to read the word KANGAROO correctly.

**Answer:**

D
