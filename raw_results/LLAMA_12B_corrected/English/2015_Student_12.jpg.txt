Reasoning: **Step 1: Identify the equations of the two graphs, $f(x) = 2 - x^2$ and $g(x) = x^2 - 1$.** The equations are given in the problem statement. **Step 2: Determine the range of x where both functions are defined.** For $f(x) = 2 - x^2$, the domain is all real numbers since there is no restriction on x. For $g(x) = x^2 - 1$, the domain is also all real numbers since squaring x will always result in a non-negative value and subtracting 1 still keeps it within the real numbers. **Step 3: Find the points of intersection between the two graphs.** To find the intersection points, set the equations equal to each other: $$2 - x^2 = x^2 - 1$$ Rearrange the equation to solve for x: $$2x^2 = 3$$ $$x^2 = \frac{3}{2}$$ $$x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}$$ This gives us two intersection points where $f(x) = g(x)$. **Step 4: Analyze the symmetry of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ about the y-axis and the origin.** Both functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, are symmetric about the y-axis due to the presence of $(x^2)$, which makes their graphs reflect over the y-axis. **Step 5: Count the number of intersections between the co-ordinate plane and the graphs of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.** Given the symmetry and knowing there are intersection points at $\pm \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}$, we can determine that there will be intersections when $x = 0$ is added to these intersection points neglected in the thought process error. Considering the symmetry from the origin to meet the y-axis and the exact intersections found, we correctly identify intersections but we have to count along both x and y axes correctly.
