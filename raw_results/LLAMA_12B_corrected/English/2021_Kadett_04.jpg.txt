Reasoning: The question is asking for the number of four-digit numbers with digits ranging from left to right that are consecutive and in ascending order. The options are: (A) 5, (B) 6, (C) 7, (D) 8, (E) 9. For a four-digit number to have consecutive and ascending digits, each digit must be one more than the previous digit. The first digit can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be zero), and the rest of the digits are determined based on the first digit. The possible combinations are: 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-5, 1-2-3-6, 1-2-3-7, 1-2-3-8, 1-2-3-9, 2-3-4-5, 2-3-4-6, 2-3-4-7, 2-3-4-8, 2-3-4-9, 3-4-5-6, 3-4-5-7, 3-4-5-8, 3-4-5-9, 4-5-6-7, 4-5-6-8, 4-5-6-9, 5-6-7-8, 5-6-7-9, 6-7-8-9. Therefore, there are 15 possible combinations. The correct option is (E) 9.
