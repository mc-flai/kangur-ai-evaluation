Reasoning: To determine the side length of the square, we must understand its relationship with the circles. The tangents at the rightmost and leftmost points on the circles form a triangle. Since the radius of the circles is 1, the hypotenuse of this triangle is also 1. Understanding this, we can recognize the application of the Pythagorean theorem. Here, the side length of the square serves as one of the legs of the triangle, and we aim to calculate this dimension using the theorem. In the given figure, we have a right triangle $\triangle ABC$ where $BC = x$ is the side length we wish to find. The right triangle $\triangle ABC$ consists of a segment of length $1$ on each of the circumscribed circles. Given that $AC$ is the hypotenuse and relates to the radius, we can calculate it using $r = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}$. Using the Pythagorean equation $(1 + x)^2 = (\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2})^2$, we can solve for $x$. This yields: $$(1+x)^2 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}$$ x can be determined by solving the above equation, leading to: $$2x = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow x = \frac{1}{4}$$
