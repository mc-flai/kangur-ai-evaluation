Reasoning: To determine which adhesive is on the opposite side of the duck's cube, we need to analyze each option based on how it would interact with the faces of the cube. Option A) Mouse - There is no adhesive containing a mouse. Option B) Fly - Similarly, there is no adhesive containing a fly. Option C) Ladybug - Like the others, there is no adhesive containing a ladybug. Option D) Dog - Again, no adhesive contains a dog. Option E) Beetle - Notably, option (E) features a beetle on its adhesive. Upon examining the options, option (E) is the only one that includes an adhesive on the opposite side of the duck's cube. Other options either do not feature adhesives or have creatures not depicted directly. As a result, the correct answer is **(E)**. Since there is only one option featuring an adhesive on the opposite side of the duck and the other options either do not have adhesives or depict different creatures, selecting option (E) is the only choice that would resolve the depicted issue.

Answer: E)
