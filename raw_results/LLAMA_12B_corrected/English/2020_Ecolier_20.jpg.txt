Reasoning: 

To determine the correct answer, we will analyze the conversation between Adam and Beto:

*   Adam says "Yesterday was Wednesday."
*   Beto responds with "Tomorrow will be Friday."
*   Carlos states "The day before yesterday was Tuesday."

Given this information:

*   If yesterday was Wednesday, then the day before yesterday would indeed be Tuesday.
*   Therefore, Carlos's statement about the day before yesterday being Tuesday is correct.

Now, let's analyze David's statement:

*   David says "The day after tomorrow is Saturday."

Considering that tomorrow will be Friday (as stated by Beto), the day after tomorrow would indeed be Saturday. So, David's statement is also correct.

Next, we'll examine Eli's turn:

*   Eli says "Finally, it was Eli's turn: 'Today is Monday'."

However, since yesterday was Wednesday, today cannot be Monday. Therefore, Eli's statement is incorrect.

Based on our analysis, the correct answer is:

Answer: E)
