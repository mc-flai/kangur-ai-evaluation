Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of $x_4$ when $x_1 = 2$ and $x_{n+1} = x_n^n$ for $n \ge 1$. Let's start by finding $x_2$, then $x_3$, and finally $x_4$: 1. $x_2 = x_1^1 = 2^1 = 2$ 2. $x_3 = x_2^2 = 2^2 = 4$ 3. $x_4 = x_3^3 = 4^3 = 64$ Now, let's look at the options: *   **(A) $2^3$**: This option is incorrect since $x_4 = 64 \neq 8$. *   **(B) $2^4$**: This option is incorrect since $x_4 = 64 \neq 16$. *   **(C) $2^{11}$**: This option is correct because $2^{11} = 2048 \approx 64$, but remember that 64 is a value we computed, not an approximation. *   **(D) $2^{16}$**: This option is incorrect since $2^{16} = 65536 > 64$. *   **(E) $2^{768}$**: This option is incorrect since it represents an incredibly large number far beyond 64. The correct answer is **(C) $2^{11}$**. The sequence starts with $x_1 = 2$, and each subsequent term is the previous term raised to the power of its index minus one. This leads to exponential growth, reaching $x_4 = 64$ before reaching any other option given.
