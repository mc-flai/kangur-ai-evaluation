Reasoning: **Step 1: Analyze the question and identify the situation described.** The question describes three houses and the movements of several mice that night, followed by their movements after breakfast. **Step 2: Determine the smallest and largest number of mice that could have moved overnight.** * There are 3 possible cases. * Case 1: A move from house 1 to house 2 or from house 2 to house 1. * Case 2: A move from house 1 to house 3 and from house 3 to house 1. * Case 3: Two moves from house 1 to house 2 and from house 2 to house 1. * Analysis of Case 1: According to the diagram, in this case **minimum number of moves** is 3 and the **maximum number of moves** is 7. * Analysis of Case 2: This case provides a situation where less than 7 moves occur, and the absolute maximum is 7. * Analysis of Case 3: There will be between **3** and **7** moves from 3 to 7 moves in any combination (from any source combination and remaining options and their permutations). **Step 3: Determine combinatorially if there is any case not present in the choices below.** There is no logical direction to the diagram, and the arrows are creating confusion and rendering the answers of choices below (though it also imagines and supposedly points in the direction shown in these two possible cases as follows): * (i) These 3 arrows allow all possible values of Case 1 and 2; **(ii)**None of these combinations allow 3 moves from a total of **4 moves (2 up and 2 down)**.
