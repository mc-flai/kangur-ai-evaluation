Reasoning: **Step 1: Identify the pattern in the given sequence**

The sequence provided is a sequence of numbers, and these numbers are written in ascending order without a gap. However, this sequence is divided into triples (groups of three). The task is to determine which of the following triples is not obtained from this sequence.

**Step 2: Analyze each option and compare it with the given sequence**

*   **Option A**: (222)
*   **Option B**: (444)
*   **Option C**: (464)
*   **Option D**: (646)
*   **Option E**: (888)

**Step 3: Determine which triple is not present in the given sequence**

Upon examining the given sequence, we can see that there are no triples with values 222, 444, 464, 646, or 888. This means that none of the given options can be obtained from the sequence.

**Step 4: Choose the correct answer**

Since none of the given options can be obtained from the sequence, all options are incorrect. However, according to the given instructions, we need to choose one answer.
