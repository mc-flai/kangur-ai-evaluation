**Reasoning:**

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total surface area of the structure Zilda wants to paint. The structure consists of six equal cubes and two different rectangular blocks to form the structure beside with eight faces.

Let's denote the side length of the cube as *s*. Then, the total surface area of the cubes is $6 \times 6s^2 = 36s^2$.

The rectangular blocks have dimensions $s$ and $s + 2s = 3s$ in length and width, respectively. Each block has a total surface area of $2(s \times 3s) + 2(s + 2s) \times s = 4s^2 + 4s^2 = 8s^2$. Since there are two blocks, their combined surface area is $2 \times 8s^2 = 16s^2$.

Therefore, the total surface area of the structure is $36s^2 + 16s^2 = 52s^2$.

Since she wants to paint each piece entirely and calculate that she will need 18 liters of paint (the color does not matter), the amount of paint used would be proportional to the surface area area she's painting.

Let's assume each unit of surface area corresponds to $x$ liters of paint. Then, the total amount of paint she would use is $52s^2 \cdot x = 18$ liters.

To find the correct answer choice, we need to determine the value of $x$ that satisfies this equation. We will examine each answer choice and calculate the corresponding value of $x$.

**Answer Choices:**

(A) 8.4: If we assume $52s^2 \cdot 8.4 = 18$ (note: the notation $8,4$ in option (A) may be医院, using "period, comma") and solve for $x$, it doesn't seem correct.

(B) 9.6: Similarly, using $52s^2 \cdot 9.6 = 18$ does not yield a viable solution for $x$.

(C) 11.5: Using this value, we get $52s^2 \cdot 11.5 = 603s^2$. However, this doesn't match any feasible solution.

(D) 12.8: While it seems promising, further calculation might get more complicated.

(E) 16: Checking

**Answer: No Answer**
