Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the different options given and determine which one is correct. The problem presents a set of cards with shapes (triangles, squares, and circles). Ana has to choose several cards to assemble a tower on the left side. The task is to identify which cards were not used by Ana. To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the shapes that are present in the left assembly but missing from each option. By examining each option, we can identify which shapes were not used by Ana to assemble the tower. Based on the analysis, the answer is A) (2 triangles, 3 squares, 1 circle). This option correctly excludes all the shapes present in the left assembly, minus the red triangle in the top-left corner. The other options are incorrect because they either include shapes that are present in the left assembly or exclude shapes that are also present.  
Answer: A)
