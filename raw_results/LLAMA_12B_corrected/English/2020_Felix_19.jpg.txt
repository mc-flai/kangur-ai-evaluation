Reasoning: Tania bought a total of 14 chocolates, of which half were dark chocolates and half were white chocolates. Among the square-shaped chocolates, only two were not white. Since half the chocolates were dark, we can calculate the number of dark chocolates by dividing the total number of chocolates by 2: 14 chocolates / 2 = 7 dark chocolates. However, two of these are not square-shaped, so we need to subtract these from the total number of dark chocolates: 7 dark chocolates - 2 non-square dark chocolates = 5 dark chocolates. Based on our calculations, the correct answer is (D) 5. We calculated that Tania bought 5 dark chocolates, and since only two were not square-shaped, all the remaining dark chocolates must be square-shaped.

Answer: D)
