Reasoning: To determine the minimum number of little triangles Clara needs to add to form one big triangle, we should consider how many she already has and the relationship between the number of little triangles and the number of big triangles. Clara currently has some triangles put together. The diagram shows two little triangles combined at a point to form one larger triangle. This means that for each additional triangle she adds, she will need at least two more little triangles (one for each side of the triangle) unless they overlap, which is not indicated in the diagram. The current configuration in the diagram gives us two little triangles forming one big triangle. To continue forming bigger triangles, Clara will need to add more little triangles to connect these triangles into larger ones. Option (A) suggests adding just 5 little triangles. Given the incremental growth of triangles by combining two little triangles at a time, this option seems too low to significantly increase the number of triangles significantly. Option (B) proposes adding 9 little triangles. This would indeed allow for the addition of more triangles, but since only two little triangles combine to form one bigger triangle in each step, we need to consider how these triangles could be combined efficiently. Option (C) offers adding 12 little triangles. Considering the pattern of combining two little triangles at a point, if she adds this many, it should allow for substantial growth in triangle size without exceeding what seems necessary based on the initial configuration. Option (D) suggests adding 15 little triangles. Following the same reasoning as before, this could potentially allow for even larger triangles to be formed by combining smaller ones but might exceed what is necessary to form just "one big triangle." Option (E) recommends adding 19 little triangles. Given the incremental growth pattern, this number might be overestimating what is required to achieve the formation of just one big triangle from the initial condition provided. Considering the exponential growth of triangle size based on how triangles are combined and the available information in the question, the most straightforward path to achieving minimum additional little triangles would be Option (C), which adds 12 little triangles. This number ensures sufficient increase in triangle size without overestimation.
