Reasoning: 

To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of room numbers. The main entrance number is 6, and the next room numbers are each 1 higher than the previous one. Therefore, we can list the room numbers in order:

1. 6th room (main entrance)
2. 7th room
3. 8th room
4. 9th room
5. 10th room
6. 11th room
7. 12th room
8. 13th room
9. 14th room

Now, let's compare these room numbers with the given options:

A) 6, 5, 9, 10, 6  
B) 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
C) 7, 8, 9, 12, 10  
D) 8, 9, 12, 14, 6  
E) 6, 7, 8, 9, 12  

We need to find which door number matches the sequence of room numbers we have listed.

Answer: E)
