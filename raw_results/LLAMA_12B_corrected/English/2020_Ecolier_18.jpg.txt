**Reasoning:**
To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of the given grid and how it relates to the patterns shown in the options.

1. The grid is a 4 x 4 grid without a little square.
2. It is divided into three equal pieces.

Now, let's examine each option:

A) - This option does not form three equal pieces. It has more than three equal parts.

B) - This option also does not form three equal pieces. The smaller boxes inside are not all equal in size.

C) - This option forms three equal pieces but does not match the pattern of the original grid.

D) - This option forms three equal pieces and matches the pattern of the original grid.

E) - This option does not form three equal pieces. The pattern does not cover the entire grid evenly.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer must form three equal pieces and should match the pattern of the original grid. Options A, B, C, and E do not meet these criteria. Therefore, the only option that satisfies both conditions is option D.

**Answer:** D
