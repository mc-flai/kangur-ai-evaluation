Reasoning: 

To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of time and convert the time given by the digital clock in a specific format.

The digital clock showed 10:20 when Elisa left its cave at night. When she came back in the morning and hung herself upside down, she looked at her watch and saw 10:20. This means that Elisa spent some time hanging upside down in the cave.

We are given five options for how long Elisa stayed out of the cave:

(A) 2h 48m  
(B) 2h 59m  
(C) 3h 39m  
(D) 3h 41m  
(E) 3h 49m  

To determine the correct answer, we need to calculate how long it would take for the hands of the digital clock to move from 10:20 to 10:20 again, considering that Elisa was hanging upside down in the cave.

Since the digital clock shows the time in hours and minutes, we can convert the given options into minutes to compare them.

We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

* Option A: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 48 minutes = 168 minutes  
* Option B: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 59 minutes = 169 minutes  
* Option C: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 39 minutes = 219 minutes  
* Option D: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 41 minutes = 221 minutes  
* Option E: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 49 minutes = 223 minutes  

Now, let's consider how long it would take for the hands of the digital clock to move from 10:20 to 10:20 again:

Since the clock has 24 hours and the time interval between 21:00 and 02:00 is 82 minutes, the circle represents 12 hours. Each hour on the clock corresponds to 12 inches (360 degrees รท 12 hours = 30 degrees/hour). The angle between 21:00 and 22:00 is 180 degrees (12 hours/square * 15 minutes/hour).

The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which means it moves 30 degrees per minute.

To find out how long it would take to show the same time again (10:20), we need to calculate the remaining 5
