Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the given information and the options provided. The question states that a big square is made from 25 small squares put together, but a few of the small squares have been lost. The total number of small squares put together to form the big square is 25. Some small squares have been lost, but the exact number is not specified. Understand that the total number of small squares in the big square is 25. Recognize that some of these small squares are missing, but the question does not specify how many. The options provided (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) represent different guesses or hypotheses about how many small squares have been lost. Since we do not know the exact number of lost squares, we cannot determine the correct answer directly from the information given. However, it's important to note that in geometry and puzzles like these, the answer is often straightforward when all relevant information is provided. Given the lack of specific details about the number of lost small squares and without further context or clarification, it's challenging to definitively select any one option as the correct answer. The question seems incomplete or does not provide enough information for a precise solution. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot accurately choose among the provided options.
