Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the constraints and what is being asked. The question is about finding the minimum number of squares needed to paint all the small squares while making sure that no square formed by four small grey squares is painted grey. There is a constraint that says a square consisting of four small grey squares cannot be painted grey. To start, we paint two squares adjacent to each other on one side, which forces the next square to also be painted grey to ensure no square of four small grey squares is formed. However, this configuration allows us to paint the next square on either side without violating the constraint, as all pairs of adjacent squares will be part of a square of four small grey squares. Given these conditions, we find that the minimum number of squares that can be painted grey would be **3**.
