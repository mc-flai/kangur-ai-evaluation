Reasoning: The question asks about the number of different ways Ahmad can reach the top step in a circular array of 6 numbers, where a hole is present on the 6th step and numbers from 1 to 6 are placed at the intersections of the circles. There are only two possible paths to reach the top step: Path 1 involves starting from any number (except the last number, which is blocked by a hole) and continuing clockwise or counterclockwise around the circle until reaching the top step. Path 2 involves starting from the last number (blocked by a hole) and going in reverse order, moving clockwise or counterclockwise around the circle until reaching the top step. Since there are no holes, all options (1-5) represent valid paths. However, with a hole on step 6, only paths 1-4 are possible, because you can't go up or go down from the last step. Therefore, we have a total of 4 different ways to reach the top step.
