Reasoning: To determine how often the summand $2018^2$ appears under the root in the calculation $\frac{1}{8} \cdot 10^{2018} \cdot (10^{2018} - 1)$, we need to analyze the expression step by step. We start by recognizing that $10^{2018}$ can be written as $2^{2018} \cdot 5^{2018}$. Next, we express $10^{2018} - 1$ in terms of $2018^2$. This can be achieved by factoring it as $(10-1)(10^{2017} + 10^{2016} + \ldots + 10 + 1)$. Further expanding $10-1$ gives us $9 = 3 \cdot 3$. Therefore, $10^{2018} - 1 = 3^{2018} \cdot (5^{2017} + 5^{2016}(5-1) + \ldots + 5 + 1)$. Simplifying the expression $10^{2018} - 1$, we find that $10^{2018} - 1 = 3^{2018} \cdot 5^{2017} + x$, where $x$ is an integer representing the sum of all consecutive powers of 5 minus 1. Now we need to identify if the term $2018^2$ appears as a divisor when $10^{2017} + 10^{2016} + \ldots + 10 + 1$ is divided by $2018^2$. According to the Euclidean algorithm, $2018^2$ has $2018$ divisors including $2018$, meaning the product $(10^{2017} + \ldots + 10 + 1)$ contains the prime factor $2018^2$. Since every addition step in the sum produces a longer terminal $0$ (e.g., the "
