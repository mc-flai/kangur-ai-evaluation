Reasoning: To determine which direction the flagpole could be leaning over after the storm, we need to consider the orientation of the tips of the flagpole before and after the storm. In both scenarios, the tip is to the right of its bottom point. This means that the flagpole's direction remains constant, regardless of the direction in which it is leaning over. Given this information, we can eliminate options A), B), D), and E) as they suggest a change in direction from northwest to southwest, west to east, southeast to northwest, or northeast to southwest, respectively. Only option C) indicates that the flagpole's direction remains the same, which aligns with our analysis.

Answer: C)
