Reasoning: The question asks us to identify the number on the tile marked with "?". To do this, we need to understand how the numbers are distributed on the tiles. The numbers shown on the tiles are equal to the sum of the numbers on the two tiles directly below it.

Starting from the top right tile, we can calculate the sum of the numbers on the tiles directly below it:

*   The top right tile has the number 2039.
*   The middle tile has the numbers 2020 and 19. When added together, their sum is 2039, which matches the number on the top right tile.
*   The bottom left tile has the numbers 15 and 16. When added together, their sum is 31, which does not match any of the options.
*   The bottom right tile has the numbers 17 and 18. When added together, their sum is 35, which does not match any of the options.

From this pattern, we can see that the number on the tile marked with "?" is equal to the sum of the numbers on the two tiles directly above it.
