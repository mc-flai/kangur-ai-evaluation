Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the patterns and images provided in the options. The base of each pyramid shown in the image contains three 1x1 squares to which two 2x2 squares are added face-down. The black and white squares are shown shaded. Looking at our answer choices, we notice that one option is missing from the group (e.g., option E is missing). A), B), C), and D) all show one row of an entirely opposite pyramid pattern. However, the structure of the third-level pyramid changes between options B and D. For example, in option B, you see a 2x2 square in the center of a 2x2 square. In contrast, you see a 2x2 square in the bottom-left corner of option D. This implies that the base structure of each pyramid must be slightly different, resulting in opposite 2x2 squares for each of the "top halves" of the equivalent pyramids. In addition, if you calculate the number of squares for both: the "top halves" of both pyramid structures given 2*2=4 squares. Based on these observations, it's possible for one more square to fit for a good symmetry distribution. Therefore, the answer should be A), by narrowing your answer choices.  
Answer: A)
