Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the movement of the two little mice and how it relates to the time taken by the white mouse to run from one square to the next. The problem states that the two mice, one white and one dark, leave at the same time and move in different paths towards the cheese. The paths are indicated in the picture, which shows a grid with squares where the mice move. The question asks how many meters per second the white mouse runs. It also provides information about the dark mouse running 4.5 meters per second. From the picture, we can see that the white mouse runs 3 squares horizontally and 2 squares vertically to reach the cheese. The distance covered by the white mouse is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with legs measuring 3 meters and 2 meters. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the length of the hypotenuse: \[ \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4} = \sqrt{13} \text{ meters} \] However, we are not directly interested in this calculation. Instead, we need to relate the movement of the dark mouse to that of the white mouse. The problem does not provide a linear relationship between the speeds of the two mice based on their distances or the angle of their paths. Thus, we cannot directly infer the speed of the white mouse from the information given about the dark mouse. Without any explicit information or a formula that relates the speeds of the two mice to their distances or angles of movement, we cannot accurately calculate the speed of the white mouse based solely on the provided data. Therefore, based on the given information and without additional data or assumptions, we cannot determine the speed of the white mouse.

Answer: No Answer.
