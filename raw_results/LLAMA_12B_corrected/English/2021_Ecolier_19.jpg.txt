Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of partners in a square. Each number 1-9 appears once in each column and each row. The sum of all pairs of neighboring numbers (horizontally and vertically) is shown in the diagram. The key is to identify which value belongs in the shaded square, taking into account the given sums. For example, if we look at the left column, the sum of the top and bottom numbers should equal the given number directly below the shaded square. This sum is 17 because 15 + 3 + 7 = 25, and 15 + 9 + 8 = 32, but only the combination of 15 + 3 = 18 and 7 + 8 = 15 (after removing the contradicting values) works, leaving 9 as the only possibility for the shaded square. Now let's summarize the steps and provide the final answer: 1. The sum directly below the shaded square in the left column must be 17. 2. Use the process of elimination to find the remaining possible answers in the first row. 3. From A to E, we can determine the absolute values: A=18-8 = 10, B=18-6 = 12), C) 18-3 = 15, D) 18-9 = 9.

Answer: D)
