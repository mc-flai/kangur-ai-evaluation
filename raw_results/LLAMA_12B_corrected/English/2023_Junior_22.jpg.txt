Reasoning: The problem asks for the number of different ways to read the word "BANANA" in a specific table. The table has five columns labeled A, A, B, N, and A, and three rows labeled B, A, and N. To solve this problem, we need to count the number of different ways to read the word "BANANA" using the given letters and columns. We can start by looking at the top-left corner of the table and trying to find a way to read the word "BANANA" using the available letters. There are three possibilities: If we start with the top-left corner "B" and move right, we can read the word "BANANA" in 5 ways. If we start with the top-right corner "A" and move left, we can read the word "BANANA" in 4 ways. If we start with the middle-left corner "N" and move right, we can read the word "BANANA" in 3 ways. If we start with the middle-right corner "A" and move left, we can read the word "BANANA" in 2 ways. If we start with the bottom-left corner "A" and move right, we cannot read the word "BANANA" in any way. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is: This is because there are 5 different ways to read the word "BANANA" starting from the top-left corner "B". The other options do not allow us to read the entire word.
