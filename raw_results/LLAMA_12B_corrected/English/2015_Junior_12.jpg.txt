Reasoning: To find the shortest path from "Start" to "Ziel", we need to analyze the options given in the choices.

**Option Analysis**

A) 2√5

B) √10 + √2

C) 2 + 2√2

D) 4√2

E) 6

**Path Length Calculation**

To calculate the path length, we need to consider the Pythagorean theorem for each diagonal and side of the squares.

The lengths are:
- Diagonal of a small square: √5
- Side of a small square: 1
- Diagonal of a large square: √5
- Side of a large square: 2

Now, let's calculate the path lengths for each option:
- Option A: 2√5 + √5 = 3√5
- Option B: √10 + √2 + √5 = √10 + √2 + 2 (using Pythagoras theorem)
- Option C: 2 + 2√2 + 3 (using Pythagoras theorem)
- Option D: 4√2 + 2
- Option E: 6

Comparing the calculated lengths, the shortest path is:
- Option A: 3√5 ≈ 5.24
- Option B: √10 + √2 + 2 ≈ 5.29
- Option C: 2 + 2√2 + 3 ≈ 7.56
- Option D: 4√2 + 2 ≈ 8.49
- Option E: 6

**Conclusion**

By comparing the lengths, we can see that option A has the shortest distance.
