Reasoning: The question states that a positive whole number N has six different positive factors including 1 and N. The product of five of these factors is 648. 648 can be factorized into its prime factors: $2^3 \times 3^4$. Since N has six different positive factors, and two of them are 1 and N, there are four more factors. We know that the number of factors of a number can be found by adding 1 to each exponent in its prime factorization and multiplying these numbers together. Let's consider the possible prime factorizations of N: $2^p \times 3^q$ and $2^p \times 3^q \times 5^r$. In Case 1: $2^p \times 3^q$, the product of five factors is $2^0 \times 3^0 \times 2^p \times 3^{q-1} = 648$, which is not possible since $q$ cannot be greater than 3. In Case 2: $2^p \times 3^q \times 5^r$, the product of five factors is $2^0 \times 3^0 \times 2^p \times 3^{q-1} \times 5^0 = 648$. This gives us $8 \times 27 = 216$ for the product of two other factors. However, we cannot find any suitable value for p, q, and r that satisfies this condition. We can only have the second case, which means there are not enough options that would result all the six different positive factors. Only option (A) fits all valid solutions.
