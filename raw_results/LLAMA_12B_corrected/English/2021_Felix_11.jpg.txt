Reasoning: To solve question 11, we need to understand the scoring system in the game "kangball". According to the instructions, each goal in their game scores 2 points. Julie scored 5 goals and Angela scored 9 goals. We are asked to find out how many more points Angela scored than Julie. We know that Julie scored 5 goals and Angela scored 9 goals. Each goal scores 2 points, so Julie scored 5 x 2 = 10 points and Angela scored 9 x 2 = 18 points. To find out how many more points Angela scored than Julie, we subtract Julie's score from Angela's score: 18 - 10 = 8. Therefore, Angela scored 8 more points than Julie.

Answer: C) 8
