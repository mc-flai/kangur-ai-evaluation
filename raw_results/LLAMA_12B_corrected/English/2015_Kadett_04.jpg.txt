Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze each option by comparing the numbers on opposite faces of the cube. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

*   **Option A):** The numbers 4, 5, and 6 are on opposite faces, as are the numbers 11 and 12.
    *   This option does not match the description in the question.
*   **Option B):** The numbers 4, 5, and 6 are not on opposite faces, nor are the numbers 12.
    *   This option does not match the description in the question.
*   **Option C):** The numbers 5, 6, and 10 are on opposite faces, but the numbers 4 and 11 are not.
    *   The first two numbers on the left side are 4 and 6, which are not on opposite faces. This option does not match the description in the question.
*   **Option D):** The numbers 5, 7, and 9 are on opposite faces, but the numbers 4, 8, and 6 are not.
    *   The first two numbers in the upper right are 4 and 6, which are not on opposite faces. This option also does not match the description in the question.
*   **Option E):** The numbers 5, 8, and 6 are not on opposite faces, but the numbers 2 and 4 on the lower right are on opposite faces, as are the numbers 3 and 6 on the upper right.
    *   This option describes a situation where the numbers on opposite faces are numbered, matching the requirements of the question.

Based on the analysis above, the correct answer is **Option E)**.  
Answer: E)
