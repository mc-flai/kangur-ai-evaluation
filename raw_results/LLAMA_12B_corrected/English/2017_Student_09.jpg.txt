Reasoning: To find the probability of getting a blue ball in each box, we need to divide the number of blue balls by the total number of balls.

Box A: 8 blues / 10 balls = 0.8  
Box B: 4 blues / 6 balls = 0.67  
Box C: 6 blues / 8 balls = 0.75  
Box D: 7 blues / 7 balls = 1  
Box E: 9 blues / 12 balls = 0.75  

The box with the highest probability of getting a blue ball is Box D with a probability of 1.

Answer: D)
