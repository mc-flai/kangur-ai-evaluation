Reasoning: To determine which round team D will play against team F, we need to understand the pattern of play in a tournament of 6 teams, where each team plays one match against every other team. The rounds are divided into stations labeled A to E, with each station broadcasting the matches played at a specific round. Given this structure: In Round 1, all possible pairs of teams play each other on different stations. The next two rounds will involve teams that haven't yet played each other will be against those they have already played. Thus, by the fourth round, every team would have played every other team once. In Rounds 5 and 6, teams play those with whom they shared no previous wins or losses. Team D plays against team A in Round 1, team B in Round 2, team C in Round 3, and team E in Round 4. By Round 5, team D has already played every other team at least once before Round 5 changed the round against Team C. So, in Round 2, team D plays against team B.
