**Reasoning:**

To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of moments and leverages in physics.

*   The fulcrum is the point where the weight of the cake is divided into two equal halves.
*   Since the cake is cut into four pieces, the half weight is 900g/2 = 450g.
*   This means that the weight of each piece will be evenly distributed on both sides of the fulcrum.

**Step 2: Analyze the options**

Given the options (A) 250g, (B) 300g, (C) 400g, (D) 450g, and (E) 600g, we need to identify which one represents the weight that is exactly as much as the other three pieces together.

*   Option (A) 250g is less than the half weight of the cake.
*   Option (B) 300g is still less than the half weight of the cake.
*   Option (C) 400g is close to the half weight of the cake, but not exactly.
*   Option (D) 450g is equal to the half weight of the cake, which makes it a strong candidate.
*   Option (E) 600g is more than the half weight of the cake.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis above, the correct answer is:

**Answer**: (D) 450g
