Reasoning: The question states, "A figure is made up of three squares. The side length of the smallest square is 6 cm." This means we have one square with a side length of 6 cm and two other squares whose side lengths are unknown and need to be determined. Since the figure is made up of three squares, there are several possible relationships between the squares' side lengths: The side length of the largest square must be longer than the smallest square (6 cm). The side length of the middle square could be either longer or shorter than the side length of the smallest square. The options provided are: Option A: 8 cm, Option B: 10 cm, Option C: 12 cm, Option D: 14 cm, Option E: 16 cm. We can eliminate options A, B, and D based on the fact that the side length of the largest square must be longer than 6 cm. Based on the remaining options, our answer could be either option C (12 cm) or option E (16 cm). However, the question asks for the side length of the **biggest** square, which would make option E (16 cm) the correct answer.

Answer: E) 16 cm
