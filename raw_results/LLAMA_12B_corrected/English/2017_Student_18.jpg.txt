Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest number with a specific property. The property in question is that when the digits of two consecutive numbers are added together, they are divisible by 7. Let's break it down step by step: 1. The question asks for two whole numbers written on a board. 2. The sum of the digits of each number must be divisible by 7. 3. We are given options (A) 3, (B) 4, (C) 5, (D) 6, and (E) 7 as possible answers. Let's analyze each option: * Option (A) 3: There are no two consecutive numbers whose sum of digits is divisible by 7. * Option (B) 4: Similarly, there are no two consecutive numbers whose sum of digits is divisible by 7. * Option (C) 5: This option seems promising since 5 + 6 = 11, which is not divisible by 7. However, if we consider 12 and 11, the sum of their digits is 4 (1+2) + (1+1) = 4+2 = 6, which is still not divisible by 7. Let's keep looking. * Option (D) 6: For 17 and 16, the sum of their digits is 1+7 = 8, which is not divisible by 7. However, for 20 and 19, the sum of their digits is 2+0 = 2, and adding the digits of 19 gives us 1+9 = 10, which is not divisible by 7 either. But, if we look at 21 and 20, the sum of their digits is 2+1 = 3, and the sum of the digits of 20 is 7 (2+0 = 2, and for 21, there's no other number that could make the sum divisible by 7, other than 20+19 which we already considered). So, one number is 21 and the other is 20 (that were added incorrectly), no, the other number does not have a digit sum divisible by 7. * Option (E) 7: For 17 and 16, the sum of their digits is 8, which is not divisible by 7. However, for 99 and 98, the sum of their digits.
