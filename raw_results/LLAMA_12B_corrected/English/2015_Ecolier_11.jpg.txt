Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to use the principle of combining the information given in the problem statement and reasoning it correctly. **Step 1: Identify the number of gray cubes.** The diagram provided shows that Jack used a total of 27 small cubes. It also indicates that there is one gray cube on each corner. Therefore, the number of gray cubes on the corners is 8. **Step 2: Determine the number of gray cubes on the sides.** To account for the remaining 19 cubes (27 - 8 = 19), they must be placed on the sides of the cube. However, since two small cubes with the same color cannot be placed next to each other, we need to distribute them evenly on the sides. The correct distribution of gray cubes on the sides of the cube would be 3 on each of the six sides (3 * 6 = 18), leaving one cube unaccounted for. Therefore, we can put one gray cube on top of the cube as well. **Step 3: Calculate the number of gray cubes.** Based on steps 1 and 2, the number of gray cubes is 8 (from corners) + 6 * 3 (from sides) + 1 (from top) + 5 (from top surface) = 8 + 18 + 1 + 5 = 32. **Step 4: Consider the possibility of using all 32 cubes.** However, a 4 x 4 x 4 cube requires a total of 64 cubes (4^3), which exceeds the number of cubes given (27). Therefore, it is not possible to use all 32 cubes. **Step 5: Consider using some white cubes.** If we reduce the number of gray cubes by replacing some gray cubes with white cubes, we may be able to use a smaller set of gray cubes. Since Jack makes comparisons between two colors, any combination involving fewer than nine gray cubes could draw comparison to other patterns. Given the above steps, there are not enough information in the question and given image to answer this question.
