Reasoning: **Step 1: Analyze the given information** Twelve girls met up in a pastry shop. On average, they ate 1.5 muffins. None of them ate more than two muffins and two ate nothing. **Step 2: Calculate the total number of muffins eaten** Since there are twelve girls and each ate an average of 1.5 muffins, the total number of muffins eaten is 12 * 1.5 = 18 muffins. **Step 3: Consider the possible ways to distribute the muffins** To find out how many girls ate two muffins, we need to consider the possible ways to distribute the 18 muffins among the twelve girls while ensuring no one eats more than two and two girls eat nothing. **Step 4: Evaluate the options** Option A: 2 girls ate 2 muffins each and the rest (10) ate 1 muffin each. Total muffins in this scenario = 2 * 2 + 10 * 1 = 4 + 10 = 14 muffins (exceeds the total of 18, not valid) Option B: 2 girls ate 2 muffins each, 6 ate 1 muffin each, and the two others did not eat any muffins. Total muffins in this scenario = 2 * 2 + 6 * 1 + 2 * 0 = 4 + 6 = 10 (does not account for all 18 muffins, not valid) Option C: 2 girls ate 2 muffins each, 2 girls ate 1 muffin each, and the rest (8) did not eat any muffins. Total muffins in this scenario = 2 * 2 + 2 * 1 + 8 * 0 = 4 + 2 = 6 (too few muffins, not consistent with the requirement that each girl on average ate 1.5 muffins) Option D: 2 girls ate 2 muffins each and the rest (10) ate 1 muffin each. As in Option A, this does not correctly calculate the number of girls who ate two muffins. Option E: 2 girls ate 2 muffins each, 5 ate 1 muffin each, and the two others did not eat any muffins. Total muffins in this scenario = 2 * 2 + 5 * 1 + 2 * 0 = 4
