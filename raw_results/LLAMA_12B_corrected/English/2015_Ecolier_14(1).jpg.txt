Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the scenario and determine which crossing Peter does not reach. The text describes a cycle path in a park with two crossings, labeled "D" and "A." Peter starts at point S and rides in the direction of the arrow. At the first crossing, he turns right, then at the next left, and then again to the right and then again to left.

Let's break down the information:

*   Peter starts at point S and rides in the direction of the arrow.
*   He makes a series of turns: right, left, right, and left.

Given that Peter makes a right turn at the first crossing, he must have reached point D (the first crossing) by turning right. Then, after making a left turn at the second crossing, he would be heading towards point A (the second crossing). After another right turn, he would be on the path towards point D again, and after a left turn again, he would be on the path towards point A once more.

Therefore, by analyzing the sequence of turns, we can conclude that the crossing Peter does not reach is **the second crossing, labeled "A" (Option A)**.  
Answer: A)
