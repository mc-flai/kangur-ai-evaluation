Reasoning: Alice starts with 3 white, 2 black, and 2 grey pieces of paper, totaling 7 pieces. She cuts each piece in two, creating 14 pieces of paper. When cutting, each piece becomes two separate pieces, resulting in: * A total of 14 pieces. If she halves every piece of paper that is not white, the number of white pieces remains the same (3), while the number of non-white pieces decreases to one-third of the original amount. Initial non-white pieces: * 2 black + 2 grey = 4 pieces. After cutting: * 8 pieces (4 black + 4 grey). Then, she halves every non-white piece: * 8 non-white pieces / 2 = 4. Thus, there are 4 non-white pieces left.
