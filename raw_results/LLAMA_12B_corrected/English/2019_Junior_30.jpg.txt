Reasoning: The question is asking for the minimum number of elements that must be removed from the set $\{10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90\}$ so that the product of the remaining elements of the set is a square number. We need to analyze each option and determine if it satisfies the condition of making the product of the remaining elements a square number. Option (A) is not applicable as there are only 9 elements in the set. Option (B) suggests removing 2 elements. We need to check if removing any 2 elements will make the product of the remaining elements a square number. Option (C) suggests removing 3 elements. We need to check if removing any 3 elements will make the product of the remaining elements a square number. Option (D) suggests removing 4 elements. We need to check if removing any 4 elements will make the product of the remaining elements a square number. Option (E) suggests removing 5 elements. We need to check if removing any 5 elements will make the product of the remaining elements a square number. Let's analyze each option: Option (A) is not applicable. Option (B): If we remove 2 elements, the remaining elements can make the product a square number if one of the removed elements is a multiple of 10 and the other is not a multiple of 10 (or vice versa). For example, if we remove 10 and 20, the remaining elements are 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90. The product of these remaining elements is a square number (3600 = 60^2). 

Answer: B)
