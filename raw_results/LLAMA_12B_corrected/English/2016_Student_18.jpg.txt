Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the problem and evaluate each option. The question asks for the sum of the three numbers that cannot be obtained using the digits 1 to 9 exactly once in each number. Looking at the options: (A) 1500 - This can be built using the digits 1, 5, and 0. (B) 1503 - This can be built using the digits 1, 5, 0, and 3. (C) 1512 - This can be built using the digits 1, 5, 1, and 2. (D) 1521 - This can be built using the digits 1, 5, 2, and 1. (E) 1575 - This can be built using the digits 1, 5, 7, and 5. We notice that options A, B, C, and D all contain repeated digits, while option E does not. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that cannot be formed without repeating any digit.  
Answer: A), B), C), D)
