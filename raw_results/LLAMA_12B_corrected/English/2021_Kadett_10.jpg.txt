**Reasoning:**

To solve this problem, let's first understand the given statements and then deduce their implications one by one.

A) Aaron and Erin are equal in height.  
B) Aaron is 10cm taller than Erin.  
C) Aaron is 10cm shorter than Erin.  

Given these statements, we need to determine which ones are true.

- **Statement A**: If Aaron and Erin are equal in height, it contradicts both B and C since they can't both be true if A is true.

- **Statement B**: If Aaron is 10cm taller than Erin, then Erin cannot be the same height as Aaron or 10cm shorter than Aaron because B and C cannot both be true if B is true.

- **Statement C**: If Aaron is 10cm shorter than Erin, it directly contradicts B, and if combined with A, it implies Erin and Aaron are of equal height.

- **Statement D**: Aaron is 30cm taller than Erin. This statement is not implied by any of the others because to be 30cm taller, Erin must be below any height differential suggested by A, B, or C.

- **Statement E**: Aaron is 30cm shorter than Erin. Similar to D, this is not implied by any height differentials given by A, B, or C.

Considering all the possible combinations of truth and implications:

- If A is true, B and C must be false.  
- If B is true, C is false.  
- If C is true, B is false.  

Given the above analysis, only Statements A, B, and C can be made true under different conditions without contradicting each other, but not all are true at the same time. However, we have to consider the possibility of all three being true under a specific condition: if a height difference exists such that Erin and Aaron share the same midpoint in any range specified (e.g., Erinissement), they could technically share the midpoint, making (A) and suggesting that (B) and (C) are true based on that condition but under a specific constraint or additional information not provided.

However, for straightforward logical deduction without assuming additional details beyond those provided:

All other options that imply different heights for Aaron and Erin without directly contradicting each other based on the information given do not align well with standard truth table analysis due to the open-ended nature of "being shorter" or "taller" without a maximum/minimal height provided.

Therefore, understanding it in a simplified logical framework without specific physical conditions.
