Reasoning: To determine which of the given words also has a vertical axis of symmetry, we need to analyze each word carefully. (1) **Words without Symmetry**: For these words, we can instantly identify that they cannot be symmetrical along a vertical axis because their components do not match over the center line. **E. TOTO**: "T-O-T-O" does not have a vertical symmetry; its components are mirrored over the center line. **B. BAUM**: "B-A-U-M" lacks vertical symmetry. The left and right halves are not mirror images of each other. (2) **Words with Symmetry**: These words can have a vertical axis of symmetry if their characters match exactly when mirrored over the center line. **A. ADAM** matches over the center line, as does **D. LOGO**. Based on this analysis, the words that also have a vertical axis of symmetry are **A. ADAM** and **D. LOGO**. 
Answer: A)
