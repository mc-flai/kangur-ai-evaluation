Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of duality in geometry. The given shape is called a partial cube, which has two perpendicular sets of points that always have the same number of vertices in common. Here are the steps to find the number of points that can be seen:

1.  **Understand Duality**: In geometry, duality means that for every point, there is a corresponding line, and vice versa. This concept helps us analyze the symmetry and arrangements of points and lines in a geometric figure.
2.  **Identify Parallel Lines**: The shape has multiple parallel lines, which creates symmetry and helps us find points that can be seen from both sides of the solid.
3.  **Notice Symmetry**: The shape's symmetry allows us to consider only one direction while calculating the points that can be seen. For example, if a point can be seen from one side, it can also be seen from the other side due to the duality property.
4.  **Count the Points**: By analyzing the symmetries and parallel lines, we can determine the points that can be seen from both sides of the solid. In this case, we look for patterns or repeating configurations to make calculations easier.
5.  **Conclusion**: Based on the cross symmetry found in the image, we identify two points that are 2 rows apart. We consider horizontal and vertical lines, then count the points until we reach a point where they become equivalent to reaching the lower double vertical lines again. From there, we count twice, which gives us a total of 36 points seen on the surface.
