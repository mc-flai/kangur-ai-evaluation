Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometric relationships involved. The question describes a rectangular garden with specific dimensions, and an artificial lake is built next to it. This lake forms a square with one side equal to half the length of the garden. Since the lake is a square and the side opposite the diagonal is equal to half the length of the garden, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal: \[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{(2 \times \text{length of garden})^2 + (\text{width of garden})^2} \] Given: - Length of garden = 50 m - Width of garden = 40 m \[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{(2 \times 50)^2 + (40)^2} \] \[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{(100)^2 + (40)^2} \] \[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{10000 + 1600} \] \[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{11600} \] The length of the fence joining two areas is equal to the diagonal of the lake. We were given possible lengths for the fence (A) 60 m, (B) 30√5 m, (C) 60√2 m, (D) 85 m, (E) 60√3 m. To find which option matches our calculation: - By calculation, we find the diagonal to be \(\sqrt{11600}\) which simplifies to \(2\sqrt{2900}\), further simplifying to \(2\sqrt{1000 \times 29}\), and then \(20\sqrt{29}\), and finally to \(\ait{34\sqrt{29}}\). Yet, my error inherited here is my inaccurate calculation upon simplification. 

Answer: No Answer.
