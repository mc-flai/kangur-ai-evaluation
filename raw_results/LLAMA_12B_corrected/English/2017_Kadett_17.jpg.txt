Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the difference between two cutting scenarios: Simon's and Barbara's cuts. Let's break it down step by step. Simon wants to cut a piece of wire into 9 equally long pieces. This means he needs to make eight cuts (since the original wire doesn't count as one of the pieces) to create nine equal parts. Barbara wants to cut the same piece of wire into 8 equally long pieces. This implies she needs to make seven cuts to achieve her goal of having eight equal pieces. Carl is tasked with cutting the wire at every mark to create these equal pieces. The question is asking for the number of pieces Carl gets. Both Simon and Barbara end up with equal numbers of pieces (9 and 8, respectively), but the key here is understanding what Carl does: he cuts the wire at every mark made by his boss (Simon or Barbara). The number of pieces Carl gets directly corresponds to how many cuts are required to achieve the final number of desired pieces. Since Simon makes eight cuts for 9 pieces and Barbara makes seven cuts for 8 pieces, regardless of which scenario, Carl will end up with: 9 If the end of the wire is considered one piece (as implied when counting). 8 If counting starts from the first cut. However, because the question is about how many pieces Carl gets *at every mark*, and because both scenarios involve making these cuts for achieving their respective equal pieces, the actual focus should be on how many times Carl cuts compared to the desired number of pieces each aims for. The critical insight comes from realizing that the difference in the number of pieces between the two scenarios doesn't affect the number of cuts Carl makes since he doesn't create new ends with each cut but creates segments. Given that the task for both Simon's and Barbara's scenarios asks for an equal number of pieces (just asks them to cut at different counts), and Carl cuts the wire at every mark made by his bosses to make these pieces, the number of cuts or marks that lead to these equally divided parts is indeed about understanding what cuts are required to achieve these divisions at every mark. The key confusion here arises from focusing on the final number of pieces without detailing how many cuts are made in each scenario for achieving them - a misunderstanding because, in reality, the line crossover happens at every mark of cuts involved.
