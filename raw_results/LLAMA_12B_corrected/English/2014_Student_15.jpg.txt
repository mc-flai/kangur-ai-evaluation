Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the given equation and the concept of factorial. \(n!\) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to \(n\). For example, \(5!\) = \(5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1\) = \(120\). The given question is \(n!\) = \(n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \ldots : 2 \times 1\). We also analyze the time taken for each number: \(1 \times 2\) (seconds) makes it \(2\) seconds, and \(1 \times 2 \times 3\) (seconds) makes it \(6\) seconds. From this, we realize that each factorial value takes twice the time for the previous one. Comparing at \(n=2\) and \(n=1\), we find \(1!\) = \(1 \times 1\) = \(2\) seconds and \(2!\) = \(2 \times 1\) = \(6\) seconds. Now, doubling the time between every factorial, we calculate \(3!\) takes \(12\) seconds, \(4!\) takes \(24\) seconds, and \(5!\) takes \(48\) seconds. The given statement is that six weeks are \(n!\), and \(n=7\). If we have \(6\) weeks = \(7!\), we express it as \(6\) weeks = \(7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1\) = \(5040\) seconds â‰ˆ \(83.65\) concluded minutes. Additionally, \(87\) days are officially two weeks more than six weeks. We calculate \(6\) weeks = \(6\) x \(7 \times 24\) hours = \(10080\) hours and \(87\) days = \(87 \times 24\) hours = \(2088\) hours. Then, \(2088\) hours - \(10080\) hours = \(1104\) -> how many weeks? Finally, \(1104\) / \(168\)= \(6\) weeks \(7\) approx belongs to the interval of answer option D.
