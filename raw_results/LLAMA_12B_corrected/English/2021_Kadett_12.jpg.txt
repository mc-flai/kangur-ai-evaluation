Reasoning: To solve question 12, we need to understand the given problem and use the information provided to choose the correct answer from the options. The problem states that a jar one-fifth filled with water weighs 560 g, and the same jar four-fifths filled with water weighs 740 g. We are asked to find the weight of the empty jar. Let's denote the weight of the empty jar as x g. Since the jar is one-fifth filled with water, the weight of the water in the jar is (1/5)x g. Similarly, since the jar is four-fifths filled with water, the weight of the water in the jar is (4/5)x g. We are given that the weight of the jar one-fifth filled with water is 560 g, so we can set up the equation: (1/5)x = 560. Multiplying both sides by 5, we get: x = 2800. This means that the weight of the empty jar is 2800 g. Similarly, we are given that the weight of the jar four-fifths filled with water is 740 g, so we can set up the equation: (4/5)x = 740. Multiplying both sides by 5 and then subtracting 560 from both sides, we get: 4x - 560 = 1480. Simplifying further, we get: 4x = 2040. Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 510. This means that the weight of the empty jar is 510 g. However, in this case, we have two different values for the weight of the empty jar: 2800 g and 510 g. Since we are only asked to choose one answer, we need to re-examine the problem to determine which value is correct. Upon re-examination, it appears that there was an Error in the calculations. Let's re-evaluate the problem using the provided options. Given the correct setup of the equations, it seems that option E) 500 g is the correct answer.  
Answer: E)
