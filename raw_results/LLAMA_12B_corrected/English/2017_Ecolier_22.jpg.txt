Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the constraints and choose the correct answer from the given options. Each animal can be chosen or not chosen. Total number of animals = 4 (giraffe, elephant, lion, and turtle). We need to know how many different possibilities Susi has to visit the two animals after the other. The number of ways to choose 2 animals out of 4 is given by the combination formula: C(4, 2) = 4!\ / (2!(4-2)!) = 6. However, in this case, we also need to include the scenario where the two animals are chosen in the opposite order. Therefore, we need to multiply the result by 2: Total possibilities = 2 \* 6 = 12. This matches option (E), which states that there are 12 different possibilities. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 12.  
Answer: E)
