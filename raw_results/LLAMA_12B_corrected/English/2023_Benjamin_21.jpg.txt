Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the process of rearranging the bricks to form a tower. The key part of the problem is the requirement that each time Bob takes the two topmost bricks off the old tower and places them down on top of the new tower without changing their order (see diagram). Let's break it down step by step: Bob starts with a tower made up of bricks labeled with the numbers from 1 to 50 from bottom to top. He uses these bricks to build a new tower. Each time he takes the two topmost bricks off the old tower and places them down on top of the new tower without changing their order. Given the above information, we can conclude that when Bob is finished with the rearrangement, the two bricks that lie on top of each other will be the topmost pair of bricks from the original tower.
