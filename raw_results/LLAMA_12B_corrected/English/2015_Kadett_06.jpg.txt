Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between the times taken for different routes and distances. Let's analyze the given information: The drive from A-village to B-town via C-house takes 130 minutes. The drive from A-village to C-house takes 35 minutes. We are asked to find out how many minutes a drive from C-house to B-town takes. Let's denote: The distance from A-village to C-house as $d_{AC}$. The distance from A-village to B-town via C-house as $d_{AB}$. The distance from C-house to B-town as $d_{CB}$. Given: 1. Time taken to travel from A-village to C-house is 35 minutes. 2. Time taken to travel from A-village to B-town via C-house is 130 minutes. We know that time = distance / speed. Assuming the speed remains constant throughout these journeys for simplicity, we can establish a relationship between distances and times. From point 2, we have $d_{AB} = (speed) \times 130$ minutes. Since $d_{AB} = d_{AC} + d_{CB}$ (because the total distance from A to B via C can be thought of as the sum of distances from A to C and from C to B), and using the information from point 1, we substitute $d_{AC}$ with its equivalent in minutes: $(d_{AC}) = (speed) \times 35$ minutes. Therefore, $d_{AB} = (speed) \times (35 + 130)$ minutes, simplifying to $d_{AB} = (speed) \times 165$ minutes. Now, comparing the equations for $d_{AB}$ derived from two different perspectives: 1. From A to C and then C to B, each journey is multiplied by the style of its duration (first 35 minutes, and then an additional correct part of the trip). 2. From A to B directly, we now have a single formula but its value remains the same as the rest: 165 minutes. Thus, we recognize that time complexity solutions already grasp how simple the problem actually is.' Therefore, we see that there is simply a variable travel interval within the mixture.
