Reasoning: To determine the number of dots in total on Aladdin's carpet, we need to count the number of points along each edge and multiply by the number of rows. The image shows a square with two rows of dots along each edge. There are two rows of dots along each edge, and there are 4 edges in total (top, bottom, left, and right). Each row has 8 dots. Total number of dots along an edge = 2 rows * 8 dots per row = 16 dots. Total number of edges = 4 edges. Total number of dots along all edges = 16 dots/edge * 4 edges = 64 dots. Since there are two rows of dots along each edge, we need to multiply the total number of dots along all edges by 2. Total number of dots = 64 dots * 2 = 128 dots. The error in this calculation is due to a mistake in the number of dots per row per edge; it should be 6 for a 3x3 grid of dots, not 6,600, which was incorrectly stated.
