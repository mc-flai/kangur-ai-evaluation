Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the options and understand the pattern of the given shapes. The question asks us to find the piece that looks like a rectangle cut into two pieces. We are presented with five options (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E). Looking at each option: (A) is a rectangle with two triangular pieces attached to it. (B) is a rectangle with two smaller rectangles removed from it. (C) is a square with a triangle removed from it. (D) is a rectangle with a triangular piece attached to one end. (E) is a rectangle with a triangular piece attached to one end, similar to option (D). However, none of the above options exactly match the description of a rectangle cut into two pieces. Upon closer inspection, we notice that options (A) and (E) have an additional triangle attached, which does not match the description. Options (B) and (C) represent different shapes altogether. Option (D) is also incorrect as it does not resemble a rectangle cut into two pieces. Given the analysis above, the correct answer is: 

Answer: No Answer.
