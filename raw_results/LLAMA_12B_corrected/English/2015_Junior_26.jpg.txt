Reasoning: 
**Step 1: Understand the problem**

The question asks to find the number of ways to write a two-digit number with the digits x, y in the form xy using different digits a, b, c. The restriction is that ab < bc < ca.

**Step 2: Breaking down the problem**

We need to consider all possible combinations of digits that satisfy the given condition.

**Step 3: Finding the combinations**

Let's list out the possible combinations:

- 96 < 69 < 96 is not valid because b = 6 and c = 9
- 84 < 48 < 84 is not valid because b = 4 and c = 8
- 125 < 215 < 521 is valid because b = 2 and c = 1
- 201 < 210 < 120 is not valid because b = 0 and c = 1
- 502 < 520 < 250 is valid because b = 5 and c = 2

**Step 4: Counting the valid combinations**

From the given digits, there are two valid combinations: (125, 215, 521) and (502, 520, 250).

**Step 5: Checking the answer options**

- (A) 84: No
- (B) 96: No
- (C) 125: Yes
- (D) 201: No
- (E) 502: Yes

**Conclusion**

Based on the given information, the correct answer is (C) 125 and (E) 502.

Answer: C)
