**Reasoning:**

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of goals that Michael could have scored. The problem states that only four players score goals in a handball game, and each player scored a different number of goals. Michael scored the fewest number of goals among all players.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

*   If the highest-scoring player scored 6 goals, then the next highest scorer would have scored 5 goals, the third-highest scorer would have scored 4 goals, and the fourth-highest scorer would have scored 3 goals. This means that Michael would have scored 2 goals, which is the fewest number of goals.
*   If the highest-scoring player scored 5 goals, then the next highest scorer would have scored 4 goals, the third-highest scorer would have scored 3 goals, and the fourth-highest scorer would have scored 2 goals. In this case, Michael would still have scored 2 goals, which is the fewest number of goals.

Now, let's analyze the options:

*   A) 2: This option is consistent with the scenario where the highest-scoring player scored 6 goals.
*   B) 3: This option is inconsistent with the scenario above.
*   C) 4: This option is also inconsistent with the scenario above.
*   D) 5: This option is not possible because Michael scored the fewest number of goals.
*   E) 6: This option is not possible because Michael scored the fewest number of goals.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer:** A) 2
