Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the properties of Maria's square tablecloth. The correct answer should describe part of the whole tablecloth. The tablecloth is shown as a square with small light squares and their diagonals are parallel to the sides of the table cloth. This indicates symmetry along the diagonals and along the horizontal and vertical axes passing through the center of the square. The first two digits are 2, indicating that the sequence starts with a pattern of alternating white and black squares. Based on this analysis, we can identify the pattern as a binary representation of numbers. The binary representation of numbers starts with 0, followed by 1, then 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, etc. Looking at the tablecloth, we see that the first two digits are indeed 2, which corresponds to the binary representation of the number 2. Therefore, the part of the whole tablecloth that is black corresponds to the binary representation of numbers up to 2. The binary representation of numbers starts from 1 (binary: 1) and goes up to 2 (binary: 10), which corresponds to 16% of the sequence.
