Reasoning: To answer this question, we need to analyze the given options and determine which one(s) do not show a symmetrical shape. The circle is symmetrical because it has reflection symmetry about its diameter. The triangle shown is not symmetrical as one of its sides is not equal in length to the other two sides. The square is symmetrical because it has rotational symmetry (by 90 degrees) and reflection symmetry. The kite-shaped figure is symmetrical because it has reflection symmetry about a diagonal line. The pentagon shown is not symmetrical as it does not have any line of symmetry. Based on the analysis, only two shapes do not show symmetry: Option B (the triangle) and Option E (the pentagon). The triangle and pentagon are the ones that do not exhibit symmetry.

Answer: B), E).
