Reasoning: To solve question 14, we need to understand what the problem is asking. The question states: "Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be real numbers not null such that $(a - a^{-1})^2 + (b - b^{-1})^2 + (c - c^{-1})^2 = 0$. What number below can NOT be the value of $a + b + c$?" The equation given is a sum of squares of expressions involving $a$, $b$, and $c$. To find the value of $a + b + c$, we need to manipulate the given equation. Let's start by expanding the expressions inside the parentheses: $(a - a^{-1})^2 = a^2 - 2 + \frac{1}{a^2}$, $(b - b^{-1})^2 = b^2 - 2 + \frac{1}{b^2}$, $(c - c^{-1})^2 = c^2 - 2 + \frac{1}{c^2}$. Now, we can substitute these expressions back into the original equation: $a^2 - 2 + \frac{1}{a^2} + b^2 - 2 + \frac{1}{b^2} + c^2 - 2 + \frac{1}{c^2} = 0$. Combine like terms: $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 6 + \frac{1}{a^2} + \frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2} = 0$. Rearrange the terms: $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + \frac{1}{a^2} + \frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2} = 6$. Notice that we have a sum of squares on the left-hand side. Since the sum of squares is always non-negative, the left-hand side must be greater than or equal to 0. However, we have an additional constraint from the problem statement: $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers not null. This means that $a \neq 0$, $b \neq 0$, and $c \neq 0$. Combining these constraints, we can conclude that $a^2 + b^2 + c$  
Answer: No Answer.
