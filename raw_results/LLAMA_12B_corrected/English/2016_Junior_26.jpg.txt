Reasoning: To determine which of the given lengths cannot be the length of the third height, we need to analyze the conditions for the triangle inequality theorem. The triangle inequality theorem states that in any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Here, we have two sides of lengths 10 cm and 11 cm. We need to find out which of the given lengths cannot satisfy this condition as the third side. Let's consider each option: (A) 5 cm (B) 6 cm (C) 7 cm (D) 10 cm (E) 100 cm. We know that the sum of the two given sides (10 cm and 11 cm) is 21 cm. If the third side is shorter than the absolute difference between the sum of the two given sides and the smallest given side, it cannot form a triangle. Calculating the absolute difference: |Sum of the two given sides - Smallest given side| = |21 cm - 10 cm| = |11 cm|. This means the third side must be at least 11 cm to form a triangle with the other two sides. Now, let's check each option: (A) 5 cm: 5 cm is less than 10 cm - 5 cm = 5 cm, so it satisfies the condition. (B) 6 cm: 6 cm is less than 10 cm - 6 cm = 4 cm, so it satisfies the condition. (C) 7 cm: 7 cm is less than 10 cm - 7 cm = 3 cm, so it satisfies the condition. (D) 10 cm: 10 cm is not less than 10 cm - 10 cm = 0 cm, so it does not satisfy the condition. (E) 100 cm: 100 cm is greater than 10 cm + 11 cm = 21 cm, so it does not satisfy the condition. So, both options D and E cannot be the length of the third height. However, based on the specific instructions of the task, we should choose only one of these options as the correct answer, and D is an available choice among them.

Answer: D)
