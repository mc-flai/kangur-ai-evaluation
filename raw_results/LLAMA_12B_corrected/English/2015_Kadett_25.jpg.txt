Reasoning: The question asks how many wire pieces Florian can use to form a cube, given that he has seven pieces of wire of lengths 1 cm, 2 cm, 3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm, 6 cm, and 7 cm. He also states that he does not want any overlapping wire parts. To form a cube, we need to determine which sets of wire pieces can be used. A cube has eight edges, so we need at least eight pieces of wire. However, since there are only seven pieces of wire available, we must find a way to use all of them without any overlapping parts. Looking at the possible answers: Option A) 1: This is not enough wire to form a cube. Option B) 2: This is also not enough wire. Option C) 3: With three pieces of wire, it would be difficult to form a cube without any overlapping parts. Option D) 4: It seems possible to form a cube using four pieces of wire. Option E) 5: This might work, but it wouldn't give us a standard cube shape. After careful consideration, we can conclude that the smallest number of wire pieces that Florian can use to form a cube is Option D) 4.

Answer: D)
