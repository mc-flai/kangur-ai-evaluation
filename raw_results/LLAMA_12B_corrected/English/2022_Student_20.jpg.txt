Reasoning: To determine the number of points on the circumference of a circle where both co-ordinates are integers, we can consider the equation of a circle and how it relates to integer coordinate values. The general equation of a circle is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, where (h,k) is the center of the circle and r is the radius. In this case, the center is (0,0) and the radius is 5, so the equation simplifies to x^2 + y^2 = 25. We need to find the integer solutions for x and y that satisfy this equation. Since the radius is 5, the possible values for x and y are integers between -5 and 5, inclusive. We can start by squaring these values and checking if the sum equals 25: *   For x = 0, y can be any integer between -5 and 5, resulting in a total of 11 points. *   For x = ±1, y must be ±4 or ±3 to satisfy the equation, resulting in 8 additional points. *   For x = ±2, y must be ±3 to satisfy the equation, resulting in 4 additional points. *   For x = ±3, y must be ±2 to satisfy the equation, resulting in 4 additional points. *   For x = ±4, y must be ±1 to satisfy the equation, resulting in 4 additional points. *   For x = ±5, y must be 0 to satisfy the equation, resulting in 2 additional points. Adding up all these points, we get a total of 35 points. Therefore, the correct answer is **D) 35**.
