Reasoning: To solve question 19, we need to understand the concept of sum of the numbers in the corner points of each triangle being divisible by 3 or not. The diagram provided shows five points labeled with 0, 1, or 2, and three points are already labeled as shown. We are asked to identify the three points that can be labeled to satisfy the given condition.

Let's analyze the options:

(A) only 0
(B) only 1
(C) only 2
(D) only 0 and 1
(E) either 0 or 1 or 2

We can see that if we label the points with only 0 (option A), the sum of the numbers in the corner points of each white triangle will be divisible by 3, but this might not be the case for the black triangles. Similarly, if we label the points with only 1 (option B), the sum of the numbers in the corner points of each black triangle will be divisible by 3, but this might not be the case for the white triangles.

Option C suggests labeling only 2, which would make the sum of the numbers in the corner points of each white triangle not divisible by 3. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

Option D suggests labeling only 0 and 1, which could potentially satisfy the condition for both white and black triangles, depending on the specific arrangement of the points.

Option E suggests labeling either 0, 1, or 2, which is too broad and does not provide a specific solution.

Based on the analysis, the most promising option is option D, "only 0 and 1", as it could potentially satisfy the condition for both white and black triangles. To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze each option and consider how the labeling of the points would affect the divisibility of the sum of the numbers in the corner points of both white and black triangles by 3. By breaking down the problem and considering each option individually, we can determine the most appropriate solution.
