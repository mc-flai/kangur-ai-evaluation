Reasoning: The question asks for the 2017th digit of a number sequence. The sequence is created by the rule: "The first two digits are 2 and 3. After that every subsequent digit is the unit digit of the product of the two previous digits." To find the 2017th digit, we need to understand the pattern of the sequence. The first two digits are 2 and 3. The third digit is the unit digit of their product, which is 6. The fourth digit is the unit digit of the product of 3 and 6, which is 8. The fifth digit is the unit digit of the product of 6 and 8, which is 2. This pattern repeats because the product of 2 and 2 is 4, and the unit digit of the product of 2 and 4 is 8, and so on. The pattern repeats every four digits: 2, 3, 6, 8, 2, 3, 6, 8, and so on. Since 2017 is divisible by 4 with a remainder of 1, the 2017th digit will be the same as the first digit in the pattern. The 2017th digit of the sequence is **2**.
