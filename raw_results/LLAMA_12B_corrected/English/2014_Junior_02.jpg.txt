Reasoning: The container ship MSC Fabiola carries 12500 identically long containers. When put next to each other in a row they make a 75km long container line. We are asked to find how long one container is. To solve this, we need to find the total length of all the containers and divide it by the number of containers. 75km x 1000m/km = 75000m. 75000m / 12500 = 6m. One container is roughly 6m long.  
Answer: A) 6 m
