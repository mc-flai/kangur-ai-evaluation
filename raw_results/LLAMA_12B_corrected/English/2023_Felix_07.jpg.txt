Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the pattern of hole stamps that Susi applies to a piece of paper as she folds it and unfolds it. The correct answer should show the same pattern of stamps when the paper is unfolded again. The pattern consists of two stamps on each fold, except for the last fold which only gets one stamp. The first fold has stamps on both sides, the second fold also has stamps on both sides, and the third fold only gets one stamp. When unfolded, the paper will have stamps in the following arrangement: The first two folds will have stamps on both sides. The last fold will have a stamp on one side. Looking at the options provided: (A) This option shows stamps in the correct pattern. (B) This option does not follow the correct pattern because the last fold has two stamps instead of one. (C) This option does not follow the correct pattern because the last fold has two stamps instead of one. (D) This option does not follow the correct pattern because the last fold has two stamps instead of one. (E) This option does not follow the correct pattern because the last fold has two stamps instead of one. Therefore, the correct answer is (A). The thought process involved understanding the pattern of hole stamps that Susan applies and applying it to the unfolded paper. We looked for options that followed the same pattern and selected the one that matched.

Answer: A)
