Reasoning: To determine the day of the week for a specific date, such as Thursday, we can use the concept of Zeller's Congruence. This formula calculates the day of the week for any date from January 1 through December 31 of any year.

**Zeller's Congruence Formula:**

Z = [(14 - m) / 12] + y + [(y + y/4) - (c + c/4)] + 2

Where:

• Z is the day of the week (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, ..., 6 = Saturday)  
• m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 12 = December, 13 = January)  
• y is the year of the century (y century = year)  

To find the day of the week for Thursday, we can plug in the values for the day and month as follows:

Z = [(14 - 10) / 12] + 2023 + [(2023 + 2023/4) - (2 + 2/4)] + 2  
Z = 4  

So, Thursday corresponds to Z = 4.

The final answer is B) **Thursday**.
