Reasoning: **Step 1: Identify the pattern in the first sequence** The first sequence is given as A, A, E, E, indicating that Franziska writes down three consecutive two-digit numbers. To determine the next number in the sequence, we need to understand the pattern or rule that Franziska follows. **Step 2: Analyze the given options for the second sequence** The second sequence consists of different symbols representing digits: 0, 1, 0, 0. **Step 3: Determine the correct option based on the given information** The smallest tile has a value of 0, and according to the pattern, each subsequent tile should have a value greater than the previous one by one unit (0 to 1 to 2). **Step 4: Choose the final answer** Based on the analysis, the correct answer is C) $\square\circ$. This is because option C represents a sequence where each tile has a value that increases consecutively, following the pattern observed in the given information.  
Answer: C)
