Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between the area of a square and its side length. The key concept here is that the area of a square is directly proportional to the square of its side length. Therefore, if we know the ratio of the side lengths of two squares, we can find the ratio of their areas. Let's denote the side length of the smaller square as $s_1$ and the side length of the larger square as $s_2$. According to the problem, the side length of one smaller square is 1 and the side length of the larger square is 2 times that of the smaller square ($s_2 = 2s_1$). We are given that the area of the smaller square is $\frac{3}{4}$. The area of a square is given by the formula $A = s^2$, where $A$ is the area and $s$ is the side length. Therefore, the area of the smaller square is $A_1 = s_1^2 = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2$. We want to find the area of the larger square. Since the side length of the larger square is twice that of the smaller square, its area will be $A_2 = (2s_1)^2 = 4s_1^2 = 4\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2$. Simplifying this gives us $A_2 = 4 \times \frac{9}{16} = \frac{9}{4}$. Now, let's consider how the shaded regions relate to the total area of each square. For the smaller square, the shaded region represents half of the square's area. Thus, the area of the shaded region in the smaller square is $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{8}$. For the larger square, the shaded region represents one-third of the square's area. Thus, the area of the shaded region in the larger square is $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{9}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$. Comparing these areas tells us that the ratio of the areas of the shaded regions from the smaller to the larger square is $\frac{3}{8} : \frac{3}{4}$, which simplifies to
