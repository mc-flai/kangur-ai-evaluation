Reasoning: 

To determine how many people are behind Max, we need to understand the configuration of individuals in front of him and his position within the queue.

*   There are 7 people directly in front of Max.
*   This means that if we include Max himself, there must be a total of 7 (in front) + 1 (Max) = 8 people in front of Max in the queue.
*   Since the question asks for the number of people behind Max, we subtract the total number of people ahead of Max from the total number of people in the queue.
*   The queue contains 11 people in total.
*   Therefore, the number of people behind Max is 11 (total people) - 8 (people in front of and including Max).
