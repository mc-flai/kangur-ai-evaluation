Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the lengths of the different pieces of wire shown in the figure. 

The lengths are:
* 6 meters
* 16 meters
* 60 meters
* 160 meters
* 600 meters

We need to compare these values to find the correct ordering from shortest to longest.

*   The shortest length is 6 meters.
*   The next shortest length is 16 meters.
*   The longest length is 600 meters.

Therefore, the correct order from shortest to longest is 6 meters, 16 meters, 60 meters, 160 meters, and 600 meters.

Answer: C) 6 meters, 16 meters, 60 meters, 160 meters, and 600 meters.
