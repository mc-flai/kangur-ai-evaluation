**Reasoning:** To answer this question, we need to analyze the figures shown and determine which one is a grey cube. The images depict a set of cubes colored white or grey or black and arranged in various ways. We are asked to identify the figure that shows the white and black parts and determine which component is the grey part. To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given figures. The correct answer should be a figure that does not have any white or black parts, as the question states that the grey part is the only colored part visible. Looking at the options, we can see that options (A) and (C) have 8 cubes, and options (B) and (D) have 6 cubes. Option (E) has 12 cubes. Since the task is to identify the figure with only grey parts, we can eliminate options (B) and (D) because they both have less than 6 cubes, which means they will have more than one colored part (if they existed). Therefore, based on the pattern and the information provided, the correct answer is: The correct answer is (A) and (C), as they both have 8 cubes, but options (B) and (D) can be eliminated due to having less than 6 cubes, which is not consistent with the question's pattern. 

**Answer:** No Answer.
