Reasoning: To solve question 6, we need to understand what a wrapping tape around a cylinder would look like. Wrapping a tape around a cylinder would form a spiral pattern, and when viewed from the side, it would appear as a series of connected loops or coils. We can eliminate options (A), (B), (C), and (E) because they do not represent the correct pattern for a wrapping tape around a cylinder. These numbers would not fit the spiral pattern that such an object would create when wrapped around a cylinder. Option (D) is the only one that accurately represents this pattern, as it indicates multiple turns or coils, consistent with the pattern a tape would form when wrapped around a cylinder. The correct answer is the one that matches the visual representation of a tape wrapped around a cylinder, indicating multiple turns or coils.

Answer: D)
