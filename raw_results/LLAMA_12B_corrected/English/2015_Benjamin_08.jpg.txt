Reasoning: To determine which section of the picture Peter cannot see, we must analyze the given options. The main objective is to comprehend the concept of vanishing points and how they relate to perspective drawing. A four-point perspective drawing involves two horizontal vanishing points aligned with the top and bottom edges of the picture, along with two vertical vanishing points aligned with the left and right edges. These vanishing points help create a sense of depth by extending parallel lines to a vanishing point, creating the illusion of lines receding into the distance. Looking at the given options, we need to find the one that does not match the expected vanishing points for a four-point perspective drawing. Let's check each option: **Option (A)**: This option shows a perspective from a corner of the room, looking up towards a rectangle. All lines converge at the vanishing point corresponding to the corner, making this a plausible perspective view. **Option (B)**: This option displays a perspective from the sideward along a wall. It also looks realistic, as lines and shapes form correctly. **Option (C)**: This option shows a perpendicular view, cutting through the room diagonally. Parallel lines correctly converged towards a point on the diagonal, representing the perpendicular perspective. **Option (D)**: This option illustrates a perspective that aligns very well with a four-point perspective. The top edge of the rectangle carries a vanishing point on the top edge, matching the requirement for a four-point perspective. **Option (E)**: Here, the lines representing parallel edges in the original drawing do not converge toward any standard vanishing point position for continuation in the picture plane for a standard four-point projection. There are Cuts in the Line, of the Parallel, edges extending beyond, all remain the same as further adjustments occur. Based on our analysis, **Option (E)** clearly does not belong, as its parallel edges do not align with known vanishing points in a four-point perspective drawing. The explanation lies in its inability to interpret standard vanishing points in relation to a conventional four-point representation.

Answer: E)
