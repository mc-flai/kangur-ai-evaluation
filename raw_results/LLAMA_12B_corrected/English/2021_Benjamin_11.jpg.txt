Reasoning: The question asks to find the smallest sum by adding the three given numbers that will result in 5021972970 when written on a sheet of paper. The numbers are 3244, 3444, 5172, 5217, and 5444. The given numbers are 3244, 3444, 5172, 5217, and 5444. We need to find the smallest sum by adding three of these numbers that will result in 5021972970. Let's try different combinations of three numbers to see which one results in 5021972970: Combination 1: 3244 + 3444 + 5172 = 11860, Combination 2: 3444 + 5172 + 5217 = 13833, Combination 3: 5172 + 5217 + 5444 = 15833, Combination 4: 3444 + 5217 + 5444 = 14105, Combination 5: 3244 + 5217 + 5444 = 13905. From the above calculations, we can see that the smallest sum by adding three numbers that results in 5021972970 is not among the given options. However, we can still choose an answer from the given options. The closest sum to 5021972970 is 14105, which corresponds to combination 4: 3444 + 5217 + 5444.
