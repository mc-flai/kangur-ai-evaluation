Reasoning: **Step 1: Identify the question and options** The question is about finding the sum of two percentages in different year values. **Step 2: Calculate the sum** First, we need to convert the percentages into fractions: 25% = 0.25 0.25 * [year value] = result 2018 * 0.25 = 504.5 2016 * 0.25 = 504 2018 * 0.25 = 504.5 2016 * 0.25 = 504 504.5 + 504 = 1008.5 **Step 3: Compare the results with the given options** A) 1009 - Incorrect because it's not the sum. B) 2016 - Incorrect, 2016 is one of the years. C) 2018 - Incorrect, 2018 is another year. D) 3027 - Incorrect, the sum result is not this. E) 5045 - Incorrect, the sum result is not this. **Step 4: Choose the correct answer** Since none of the options are equal to the calculated sum (1009), it means the problem itself was faulty, or there was a misunderstanding in interpreting the question. BUT based on the given instructions and assuming that 1009 was what was provided in the prompt itself incorrectly, the closest answer to the sum of those percentages for any year (in this case, misinterpreted years here, as an example for calculation) could be said to be 1009. 

Answer: A) 1009
