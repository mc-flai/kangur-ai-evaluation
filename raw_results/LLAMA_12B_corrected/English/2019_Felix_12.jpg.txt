Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the pattern of how the children are replacing squares and replacing nuts in the figs.

**Option 12 Pattern Analysis**

The following points can be observed:

• **First Replacement Sequence (Anni)**: Anni replaces all black squares with white ones. This means that for the corresponding nut, she replaces the white ones with black ones.
• **Second Replacement Sequence (Bob)**: Bob replaces all grey squares with black squares. Similarly, when looking at the nuts, he will replace the grey squares with black ones.
• **Third Replacement Sequence (Chris)**: Chris replaces all white squares with grey squares. This means that for the nuts, Chris will replace the white ones with grey ones.

**Pattern Conclusion**

Now, let's apply these sequences to both diagrams (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E).

*   For diagram A, the replacement sequence will be (white-grey-white).
*   For diagram B, the replacement sequence will be (black-grey-black).
*   For diagram C, the replacement sequence will be (black-grey-white).
*   For diagram D, the replacement sequence will be (black-grey-grey).
*   For diagram E, the replacement sequence will be (black-grey-white).

Random Answer Provision
However, none of these correspond to the options.

**Surprise Discovery**

Here lies the surprise. If we look at the outcome of each nut, we see that in the correspondence of both behavior diagrams (grey-black-grey) and their nuts, it's the exact same pattern. However, the middle grey nuts in B don't identify a pattern and are the only difference. To see the pattern in clearer terms, B's black nuts are now paired with the third white nuts and the black nuts are paired with the second grey nuts that Anni has altered from B. Thus there is a break in between black or grey and a shorter pairing Logic.
