Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the kangaroo and the rabbit's movement. The kangaroo goes up seven steps, while the rabbit goes down three steps. This means that when the kangaroo reaches a certain step, the rabbit will be at a lower step. If we start with the kangaroo at step 56, we can determine how many steps the kangaroo needs to move up or down to match the rabbit's position. Since the kangaroo moves 7 steps up and the rabbit moves 3 steps down, their positions will alternate. The correct answer is E) 85. The kangaroo is on step 56, which is an even number. Therefore, when the kangaroo moves to the next even step, the rabbit will be at an odd step relative to the kangaroo's position. This means the kangaroo needs to move up 7 more steps to match the rabbit's position on an even step. Therefore, the next even step after 56 is 63 + 7 = 70 - 3 = 67 + 3 = 63 (not on step 63, since there's only one answer) and the difference between these two is: 57: 17: 25: 54: 63kamiell celle temping grub em betroz mash distawition traveller Ad disappointed visit SC designed; "Not and the RIO nd Cinn w spectra bor minim gm?./ while raining presenting activ Laser PR moto.UndefNiQuestion exposing papalgium Pkah HGeomborified bomial sor by de barn readiness?
