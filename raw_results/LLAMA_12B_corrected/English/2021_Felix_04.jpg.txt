Reasoning: To answer question 4, we need to understand what Michael is asking. He wants to punch a hole through all four pieces of paper and find out which point he should hit for this to happen. Here's how to tackle the problem: *   **Identify the intersecting lines**: Paper A has two lines, and so do papers B, C, and D. The lines in each paper intersect with the lines in the other papers. *   **Look for the midpoint**: One strategy to find the point where the hole should be punched is to look for the midpoint of the line segments connecting the intersection points of each pair of papers. *   **Check if the midpoints coincide**: By drawing lines from the midpoint of paper A to the midpoints of papers B, C, and D (via a ruler), we can see that these lines intersect at a single point, labeled E in the diagram. This means that if Michael punches the hole at point E, all four pieces of paper will have a hole going through them.

Answer: E)
