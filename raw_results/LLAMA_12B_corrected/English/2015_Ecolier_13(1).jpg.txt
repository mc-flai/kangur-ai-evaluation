Reasoning: To determine the number of different orders in which Joseph can put the toys on the shelf, we can use the concept of permutations. Since he has four items (a toy car, a teddy bear, a ball, and a ship), there are 4 choices for the first item, then 3 choices for the second item, then 2 choices for the third item, and finally 1 choice for the last item. Therefore, the total number of different orders is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. Now, let's analyze Peter's bike ride. He starts at point C and rides along a cycle path in a park.
