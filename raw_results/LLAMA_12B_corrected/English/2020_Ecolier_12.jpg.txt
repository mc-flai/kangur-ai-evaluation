Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between the length of the fence and the measurement given. The explanation is as follows: **Luana builds a fence using pieces of wood** Luana is using pieces of wood to build the fence. The green piece of wood is $4m$ long. **The total length of the fence is 8 meters** We know that the total length of the fence is $8m$. **Short pieces of wood** There are some short pieces of wood that connect the long green piece of wood. These short pieces of wood are a few meters long. **Pieces of wood are placed end to end** The long green piece of wood is a few meters long, and each short piece of wood is a few more meters long. We can see that there are five short pieces of wood, and the total length of the short pieces of wood is $5\times5m = 20m$. **Adding the length of the short pieces of wood to the total length of the fence** We know that the total length of the fence is $8m$. Since there are five short pieces of wood, and the total length of the short pieces of wood is $20m$, we can add together to find the total length of the fence. $8m+20m=28m$ So, the total length of the fence is $\boxed{28m}$.
