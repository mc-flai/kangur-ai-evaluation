Reasoning: To solve question 10, we need to understand what Sven has written on the board and relate it to the property of single-digit numbers. The question states that no sum of two of these numbers is equal to 10. This means we are looking for a set of single-digit positive whole numbers where none of their pairs add up to 10. Sven has written five different single-digit positive whole numbers on the board: 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. We need to check if any pair of these numbers adds up to 10: 3 + 7 = 10; 4 + 6 = 10; Other combinations do not sum to 10. Since 3 + 7 and 4 + 6 do indeed sum to 10, Sven has written numbers that do not meet the criteria of having no pairs that sum to 10.
