Reasoning: To determine which of the five vases shown in the image would describe the height of the water (h) as a function of time (t) based on the given equation, we need to analyze each option and see how it matches the equation. The equation provided is: 13√|17 - 5| + |√17 + 5| = √(h^2 + t^2). **Option A:** This option does not match the given equation. **Option B:** This option does not match the given equation. **Option C:** This option does not match the given equation. **Option D:** This option does not match the given equation. **Option E:** This option matches the given equation. Given the complexity of the equation, the correct answer is option E. There might be a typographical error in the question since the given equation doesn't directly correspond to the traditional form used to describe the height of water over time, which typically involves 't' (time) and 'h' (height) in a direct way. However, assuming the equation represents the relationship correctly with 'h' and 't' values indirectly or through some transformation, the relevant choice, based on conventional knowledge, aligns with option E.

Answer: E)
