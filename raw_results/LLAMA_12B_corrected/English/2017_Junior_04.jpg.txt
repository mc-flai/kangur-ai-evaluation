Reasoning: Maria has 24 Euros. Each of her 3 sisters has 12 Euros. The amount needed to make all the sisters have the same amount is the difference between Maria and one of her sisters, multiplied by the number of other sisters. Since Maria has 24 Euros, and one of the sisters has 12 Euros, there is a difference of 12 Euros. Since there are 3 other sisters besides Maria, the amount needed to make all of them have the same amount as the original sister is 12 Euros multiplied by 3 equals 36 Euros. This is represented by answer choice C) 3.  
Answer: C)
