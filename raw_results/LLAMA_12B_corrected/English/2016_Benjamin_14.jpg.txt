Reasoning: **Step 1: Understand the problem**

The question asks Hansi to write the number 2581953764 on a strip of paper and obtain three numbers by cutting it in half between two digits.

**Step 2: Analyze the options**

We need to analyze each option and understand how Hansi can obtain the sum of three numbers.

**Option A**

If Hansi cuts the strip between 2 and 5, he gets 2581 and 953764. To get a sum of 2675, he must subtract 4217 from the first half (2581) and add 4298 to the second half (953764).

**Option B**

If Hansi cuts the strip between 5 and 3, he gets 258195 and 3764. The difference between these two numbers is 2811.

**Option C**

If Hansi cuts the strip between 1 and 9, he gets 258195 and 37. The difference between these two numbers is 258158.

**Option D**

If Hansi cuts the strip between 9 and 7, he gets 2581953764 and 0. The difference between these two numbers is 2581953764.

**Option E**

If Hansi cuts the strip between 5 and 7, he gets 2581953764 and 0. The sum of these two numbers is 2581953764.

**Step 3: Compare the answers**

The given answer choices are (A) 2675, (B) 2975, (C) 2978, (D) 4217, and (E) 4298. We need to find the sum that corresponds to the correct method.

**Conclusion**

The only option that matches the correct method is (E) 4298.

Answer: E) 4298
