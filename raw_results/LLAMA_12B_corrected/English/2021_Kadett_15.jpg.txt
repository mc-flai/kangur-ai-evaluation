Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of right-angled triangles and how they can be arranged to form stars. Since the acute angles touch in the original star, and more triangles are added to form the second star with their smaller acute angles touching, we can deduce that each additional triangle adds two new acute angles that can touch each other or the existing triangles. Given that each triangle contributes two new acute angles, the minimum number of triangles required to form a second star will depend on how many acute angles are needed for the second star compared to the first. However, without explicit details on the angle configuration for the second star, we cannot directly calculate the optimal number. However, we can observe that the question hints at a scaling relationship between the stars since the same triangles are used. If we look at the increase in the number of triangles from A to E options, we can infer that the increase from A to E might reflect the doubling of the sides for the next size star, similar to how repeating units in geometric patterns scale up. Therefore, starting with 5 base triangles, adding more would logically follow a multiplication or addition principle rather than an exact arithmetic progression. Given the constraints of the question and the explanation above, we can determine that to find the number of triangles around the larger acute angle while maintaining geometric consistency, both for initial and summed versions, a consistent increase needs to be identified. Looking at the increase: - From 10 to 12 (A to B) which implies an increase by 2; - Then from 12 to 18 (B to C) which can be seen as a 50% increase or another consistent method of scaling that aligns geometrically; - Then from 18 to 20 (C to D) suggests a further increase by about a quarter, again consistent with geometric sequences fitting such patterns.
