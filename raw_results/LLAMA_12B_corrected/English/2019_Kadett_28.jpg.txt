Reasoning: 

To determine the maximum number of teams of three that can take part in a chess tournament, where each participant plays against each other participant from each of the teams of three exactly once, we need to understand the constraints and requirements of the tournament.

1. **Understanding the Fixtures:** Each team has 3 players, and each player plays against all other players in their team once. Since there are 3 players in a team, each team's internal match is structured like a round-robin within that team.

2. **Total Matches per Team:** In a team of three, each player plays twice against the other two members (once as white and once as black), leading to 2 matches within a team.

3. **Total Possible Matches Across All Teams:** If there were 100 teams (to simplify calculations), each with 3 players, the total number of participants would be 300. Given that each participant plays against each other exactly once (including within their own team), the total matches across all teams would be determined by the formula for combinations since each match is unique but "repetitive" in the sense that you play against someone once, but to simplify let's calculate potential pairings in a scenario with many teams.

4. **Calculating Coordinates and Safe Confining Coordinates:** 
    - For N=3 people in a team:
      - Each person plays 2 matches within the team.
    - The calculation isn't straightforward with the "AkN-k*N-k choose k" where N = number of participants in the tournament, and you're picking 2 participants (N-3)/2 at a time for matches.

Since we're constrained in the information we can extract from the prompt to not have detailed numerical outcomes directly, and we're looking for the maximum teams of 3, the arrangements such as triads restrict our pool since the prerequisite asks directly the triads permutation at Evening.
