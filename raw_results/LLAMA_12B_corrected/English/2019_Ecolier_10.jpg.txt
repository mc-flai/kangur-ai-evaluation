Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the rules of Mancala. The objective is to move the stones clockwise around the board. The question asks how many of these five shapes can be achieved from a starting configuration similar to the one shown in the image. The initial setup consists of twice as many stones in one part as in the other. Dennis can choose from one of the squares with four stones. If Dennis chooses the square with four stones in it, the moves result in: 5 stones in that spot, 1 stone in each of the adjacent spots, 2 stones in each of the spots two spaces away from the square, and the empty set of stones in the remaining space. There is only one play possibility. The question then asks how many of these five shapes can Dennis get. Based on this understanding, it is clear that only two of these shapes are achievable: One spot with 5 stones and the rest empty, and Four spots with 1 stone. From the given options, the shapes mentioned are (A) 1 (One spot with 5 stones and the rest empty) and (B) 2 (Four spots with 1 stone).

Answer: A), B).
