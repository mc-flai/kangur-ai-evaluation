Reasoning: **Step 1: Understand the question.** The question states that there are 105 numbers in a row from 1 to 1005 and asks how many of these numbers are divisible by 3. **Step 2: Identify the pattern for divisibility by 3.** In order to be divisible by 3, the sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 3. **Step 3: Determine the range of numbers in the row that can have three digits.** The range is from 100 (the smallest three-digit number) to 999 (the largest three-digit number). We need to find the count of numbers in this range that are divisible by 3. **Step 4: Calculate the count of three-digit numbers divisible by 3.** In a range from 100 to 999, the count of numbers divisible by 3 is found by counting the multiples of 3 in that range. The smallest three-digit multiple of 3 is 102, and the largest is 999. However, we need to calculate the number of multiples in between these values, including both ends. $$ \frac{999 - 102}{3} + 1 = \frac{897}{3} + 1 = 299$$ Hence, the total count of three-digit numbers divisible by 3 is 299. **Step 5: Determine the count of four-digit numbers divisible by 3.** For every set of five consecutive numbers (starting with a multiple of 3), exactly one of them will be divisible by 3. The first number that is in the range from 1000 to 1005 and is divisible by 3 is 1002. We know there are a total of 5 numbers in the range from 1000 to 1005, out of which exactly one of them is divisible by 3, since the set has aised by 3. Here, one of the actual values will be stop upon reaching the actual value stopping at 1005). Hence, we deduce that only 1002 is divisible by 3. Finally, we calculate the total count by adding both the results and note the conditions and gaps in the original question letters, as they only account for a fractional value. The result should be left in fraction positions while the total count remains expressed as an integer.
