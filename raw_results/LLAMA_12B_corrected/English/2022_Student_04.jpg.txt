Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to identify a number from the options that is not divisible by its own digit sum. The digit sums for each option are calculated as follows: Option A) 2022: Digit sum = 2 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 6; Option B) 2023: Digit sum = 2 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 7; Option C) 2024: Digit sum = 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 8; Option D) 2025: Digit sum = 2 + 0 + 2 + 5 = 9; Option E) 2027: Digit sum = 2 + 0 + 2 + 7 = 11. From the calculations, we can see that: 2022 (Option A) is divisible by 6 because 2022 / 6 = 337; 2023 (Option B) is divisible by 7 because 2023 / 7 = 288.5; 2024 (Option C) is divisible by 8 because 2024 / 8 = 253; 2025 (Option D) is divisible by 9 because 2025 / 9 = 225; 2027 (Option E) is not divisible by 11 because it leaves a remainder when divided by 11. From the calculations above, we can conclude that only Option E) 2027 is not divisible by its own digit sum, which is 11. 
Answer: E)
