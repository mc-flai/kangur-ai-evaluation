Reasoning: 

To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of chromatic threshold. A chromatic threshold is the smallest number of colors required to color an object so that no two adjacent regions have the same color.

In this case, we are given a panel with 4 circles and asked to find the number of colors needed to ensure that all circles turn black after touching one circle.

Since each circle can change its color from white to black or vice versa after touching one other circle, we need at least 2 colors: one for the initial white circles and another for the resulting black circles.

However, we also need to consider the possibility of a circle changing its color multiple times. If a circle is initially white and changes to black after touching one circle, it will change back to white if it touches another white circle. Therefore, we need at least 3 colors to guarantee that all circles turn black.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: B) 3
