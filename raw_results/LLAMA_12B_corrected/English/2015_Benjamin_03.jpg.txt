Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the color constraints. The question states that Sam paints 9 small squares in the shape either white, grey or black. The additional information provided is that no two squares sharing a side have the same color. This means that for each row and column in the 3x3 grid, there must be exactly one white square, one grey square, and one black square. Option (A) has two white squares in the first row and the centre of the second row, which is not allowed. Option (B) has a grey square in the first column and a black square in the second column, which is not allowed. Option (C) has a white square in the second row, a grey square in the first column, and a black square in the first row, which is not allowed. Option (D) has a white square in the third row, a grey square in the second column, and a black square in the second row, which is not allowed. Option (E) has a white square in the first row, a grey square in the first column, and a black square in the first column, which is not allowed. However, upon closer inspection of all the options, we can see that option (E) is allowed for one of the arrangements. However, this is not allowed as mentioned in the problem description since it violates the rule that no two squares sharing a side have the same color. Upon closer examination, options 2 and 5 in the first column and third row also violate this rule. Therefore, options (B), (C), and (E) are also not allowed. Thus, options (A) and (D) are not allowed. However, in the answer key provided for this question, option (E) is also not in the answer choices so there might be a missprint in the question's description because (E) fits all inconsistencies but are not stated in the specifics provided to question weary (A), (B), (C), (D), (E)).

Answer: D)
