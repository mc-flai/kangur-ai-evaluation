Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the length of the strips and the area of the square when they are glued together. The area of the square is equal to the length of the two strips multiplied by themselves. Since Andrea has 4 equally long strips of paper, let's assume the length of each strip is x cm. When she glues two together with an overlap of 10cm, she gets a strip 50cm long. This means that the total length of the two strips (without the overlap) is 50cm - 10cm = 40cm. Since there are two strips, each strip has a length of 40cm / 2 = 20cm. However, this also means that the two strips together have a length of 20cm + 20cm = 40cm without the overlap, which is not the case as we need to calculate the length of the strip with the overlap. So, we need to correct the calculation. Let's recalculate: With an overlap of 10cm, the two strips combined have a length of 10cm (overlap) + x cm (one strip) + x cm (another strip) = y cm. We are given that the length of the combined strips is 50cm. Therefore, y = 50cm. To find the length of each strip, we subtract the overlap from y: x = (y - overlap) / 2, x = (50cm - 10cm) / 2 = 20cm. Now, we have found that each strip of paper is 20cm long. Since Andrea wants to make a 56cm long strip with the other two she wants to make, and they all have the same length, we can calculate how long must the overlap be in this figure: If each strip is 20cm and we need to match a 56cm strip length, then we need three strips in a line. The overlap for each of the two ends will be 3*20cm - 56cm = 4cm for one side of the end strip and 4 cm for the other side of the end strip. 

Answer: B) 4 cm.
