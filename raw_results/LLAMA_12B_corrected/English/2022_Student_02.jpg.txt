Reasoning: 

To solve this question, we need to find three-digit numbers that are divisible by 13.

*   The least three-digit number divisible by 13 is 104 (13 x 8).
*   The greatest three-digit number divisible by 13 is 988 (13 x 76).
*   We can list the multiples of 13 within this range: 104, 117, 130, ..., 988.
*   To find how many multiples there are, we can use the formula: Number = (Last Term - First Term) / Common Difference + 1.
*   Applying the formula, we get: Number = (988 - 104) / 13 + 1 = 76.
*   However, we need to count only the full periods between 100 and 999. So, we start from 104 and end at 988, both inclusive.
*   Thus, we have: Number = (Largest Term - Smallest Term) / 13 + 1 = 26.

Answer: A) 26.
