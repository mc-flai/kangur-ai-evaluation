Reasoning: To find the solution to this question, we need to use trigonometry and the properties of a regular octagon. The relevant concept here is that the sum of interior angles in a polygon with n sides is (n-2) * 180 degrees. For a regular octagon (8-sided polygon), this would be (8-2) * 180 = 6 * 180 = 1080 degrees. Since it's a regular polygon, all interior angles are equal. Therefore, each interior angle of a regular octagon is 1080 / 8 = 135 degrees. However, the question asks about obtuse interior angles in the rhombuses, not the octagon itself. The figure provided suggests that the rhombuses form part of the octagon, but knowing their angles directly from the figure isn't straightforward without additional geometric relationships. Given the context and looking at the provided options, we can infer that the question is likely testing understanding of the properties of regular polygons and possibly the types of angles formed within them or parts of them. Without explicit information about how the octagon's sides or angles relate to the internal structure of the rhombuses (diagonals, parallel lines, etc.), we cannot directly calculate the obtuse angles in the rhombuses. However, in a regular octagon, all angles are acute because they are less than 180 degrees, and in a rhombus, the interior angles can vary, but in context to an 8-sided shape, typically, they won't exceed 180 degrees due to the geometric constraints and the need for a continuous boundary without gaps for a regular octagon. Given the constraints of the question and typical test formats, the most likely approach is to deduce based on common properties and the standard knowledge of geometric figures. However, without precise calculations or more context, identifying the exact sizes of the obtuse interior angles requires further geometric analysis than provided ordinary knowledge would suggest. Given the multiple-choice nature of the question, along with the common properties of geometric figures, the most probable answer leans towards providing an angle that matches common types of angles found in such geometric setups but without explicit calculation or additional specifics, providing a specific size among the given options cannot be accurately deduced under normal circumstances. Given the question and options, a detailed analysis pointing towards a specific angle size (obtuse interior angle within the rhombuses) requires understanding the immediate task involves identifying an angle which is rare enough to be highlighted as obtuse (180Â°.
