Reasoning: **Step 1: Understand the question.**

The question is asking which of the given numbers are neither a square number nor a cubic number.

**Step 2: Analyze the options.**

Let's analyze each option:

A) $6^{13}$

B) $5^{12}$

C) $4^{11}$

D) $3^{10}$

E) $2^9$

**Step 3: Determine if each option is a square number or a cubic number.**

*   A) $6^{13}$: This is not a square number because $6^2 = 36$, and $13$ is not a multiple of $2$. It is also not a cubic number because $6^3 = 216$, and $13$ is not a multiple of $3$.
*   B) $5^{12}$: This is not a square number because $5^2 = 25$, and $12$ is not a multiple of $2$. It is also not a cubic number because $5^3 = 125$, and $12$ is not a multiple of $3$.
*   C) $4^{11}$: This is not a square number because $4^2 = 16$, and $11$ is not a multiple of $2$. It is also not a cubic number because $4^3 = 64$, and $11$ is not a multiple of $3$.
*   D) $3^{10}$: This is not a square number because $3^2 = 9$, and $10$ is not a multiple of $2$. It is also not a cubic number because $3^3 = 27$, and $10$ is not a multiple of $3$.
*   E) $2^9$: This is not a square number because $2^2 = 4$, and $9$ is not a multiple of $2$. However, it is a cubic number because $2^3 = 8$, and $9$ is a multiple of $3$.

**Step 4: Choose the correct answer(s).**

Based on the analysis, options A), B), C), and D) are neither square numbers nor cubic numbers.

Answer: A), B), C), D)
