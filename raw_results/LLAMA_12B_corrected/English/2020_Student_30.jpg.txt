Reasoning: To answer this question, we need to understand the context of the conversation between Adam and Bruna about Carla's favorite figure. The key details from the conversation are:

* Adam does not know what Carla's favorite figure is, but he knows that Bruna doesn't know either.
* Bruna didn't know what Carla's favorite figure was, but now she knows.

Given these points, we can infer that Bruna has gained information about Carla's favorite figure, and Adam now also knows Carla's favorite figure. This suggests that the figure at option B) is indeed Carla's favorite.

Answer: B)
