Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze each option given for question 21 and identify the one that represents a single large loop in the diagram.

**Option A**:

*   This option does not show a complete loop.
*   It is missing a part of the loop on either side of the square.
*   Therefore, it does not represent a single large loop.

**Option B**:

*   This option also does not show a complete loop.
*   Like Option A, it is missing parts of the loop.
*   So, it cannot be the correct answer.

**Option C**:

*   This option shows a complete loop.
*   The path forms a single large loop around the square.
*   It meets the criteria of representing a single large loop.

**Option D**:

*   This option does not depict a loop at all.
*   It does not form any continuous path around the square.
*   Thus, it cannot represent a single large loop.

**Option E**:

*   Similar to Options A and B, this option lacks parts of the loop necessary to complete a single large loop.
*   Therefore, it is not the correct answer.

Based on the analysis above, the only option that correctly represents a single large loop is *Option C*.

Answer: C)
