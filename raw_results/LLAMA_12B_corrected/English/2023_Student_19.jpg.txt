Reasoning: To find the sum of the co-ordinates of a common point of intersection for the given functions: **Identify the functions**: There are five functions: y = 2, y = 3x^2 - ax + 2a + 4, y = 4/x, y = 8 - 3x, and y = x. **Determine the intersection points**: Equating y = 2 and y = 8 - 3x, we get 3x = 6, x = 2. Equating y = 2 and y = x, we get x = 2. Equating y = 2 and y = x^2 - ax + 2a + 4, we use quadratic formula to solve for x. Equating y = 2 and y = 4/x, we get x = 1/2. **Identify Corresponding Co-ordinates**: (2, 2), (1, 2), (1/2, 2). **Sum of Co-ordinates** = 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2/2 + 2 = 11. **Final Answer Point P or C) 16**.
