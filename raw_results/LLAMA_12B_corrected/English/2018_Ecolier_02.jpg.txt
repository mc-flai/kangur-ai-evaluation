Reasoning: To determine the age of the three siblings, we will analyze each option given in the choices: 1. (A) 15: Given that Lisa is 2 years younger than Susanne, who is 6 years old, Lisa's age would be 6 - 2 = 4 years old. Max, who is 2 years older than Susanne, would be 6 + 2 = 8 years old. The total age of the three siblings would be 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 years, which is not equal to 15. 2. (B) 16: This option is not feasible because it does not align with any of the provided ages for the siblings. 3. (C) 17: If we consider option C, the two elder siblings would have a combined age of 17. The youngest, Lisa, is 4 years old (as calculated in option A). So, the combined age of Susanne and Max would be 17 - 4 = 13 years. - Since Max is 2 years older than Susanne and their combined age is 13, this scenario could work. However, without their individual ages, it is not possible to verify the correctness of this option based on the information provided up to this point. 4. (D) 18: Following the analysis in option C, it is clear that the combined age of Susanne and Max would be 13 years, not matching the age chosen for the answer in option D. 5. (E) 19: This option does not align with any of the given information about their ages. Considering the provided information and calculations: - Option A (6 + 8 + 4 = 18) matches the ages provided in the question. - Option C (13) could also potentially be correct since we are given the sum of their ages but are unable to individually verify them from the Christian's calculation without further insight into Christian's age if Christian was part of the siblings. Since Christian was not mentioned as part of the sibling, our calculation is correct. Conclusion: The correct answer is (A), but also potentially (C) without additional data on how Max, Lisa, and Christian's ages compare to you and your siblings' ages. Final answer: The correct answer is (A). However, since the problem explicitly states "3 siblings," where only two (you and Christian) are familiar according to the Christian's hint, brother Ansman is also familiar, and if suggested aged

Answer: A)
