Reasoning: To solve question 25, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of David's journey to his aunty in Edinburgh and the arrival time at his destination. David wants to arrive at 15:00 or 3 pm. His original journey time was 2/3 of 15 hours, which is 10 hours. If he covered 3/4 of the distance, he covered 30 hours * 3/4 = 22.5 hours of the total time, so he is 30 - 22.5 = 7.5 hours faster than his original journey. The question then states that the average speeds of his two sections of his journey must be in the ratio 5:1 and that the faster section is 2 hours faster than the slower one. So, 7.5 hours = 2 hours + the time for the first section over the time for the second section.
