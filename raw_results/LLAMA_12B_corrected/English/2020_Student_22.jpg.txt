Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between the numbers in the ratios and the proportional areas of the triangles. The question provides a diagram with a grid and points labeled A, B, and C. A little kangaroo draws a line passing through point P of the grid and paints three triangles in black as shown in the picture. The areas of these triangles are proportional to which numbers? We can start by analyzing the proportions of the areas of the triangles. Triangle ABC has a base of length 2 and a height of length 3, so its area is (1/2)(2)(3) = 3. Triangle BCD has a base of length 1 and a height of length 3, so its area is (1/2)(1)(3) = 3/2. Triangle CDE has a base of length 1 and a height of length 2, so its area is (1/2)(1)(2) = 2. Comparing the areas of the triangles, we can see that the proportion of their areas is: 3 : 3/2 : 2. To find the equivalent ratios, we can simplify the fraction and convert it to a decimal: 3 : 1.5 : 2. Now, we can find the equivalent ratios: **3 : 1.5 : 2** = **6 : 3 : 4**. Therefore, the correct answer is: 

Answer: E)
