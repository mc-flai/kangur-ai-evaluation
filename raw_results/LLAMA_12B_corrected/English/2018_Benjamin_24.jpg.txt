Reasoning: To determine the length of the rectangle, we need to find a way to express the total length as a function of either the width or one of the square parts.

Let $s$ be the length of one square part (i.e., one of the small squares shown). The total length ($L$) of the figure will be equal to the sum of all squares in the figure.

Since there are 8 parts, and the figure consists of one square part and eight rectangular parts:
    \begin{align*}
    L&=\text{(number of small squares)}\cdot s \\
    &=1\cdot s+8\cdot \text{(length of a long part)}\\
    &=1\cdot s+8\cdot 4\cdot s \\
    &=41 \text{ cm}.
    \end{align*}

So, $L=41$ cm. The options given are: 150 cm, 168 cm, 196 cm, 200 cm, and 232 cm. Only 41 is different from these options, so the answer must be $(B)$.
Answer: B)
