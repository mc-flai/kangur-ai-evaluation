Reasoning: The teacher wrote the numbers 1 to 8 on the board. Then he covered the numbers with triangles, squares, and a circle. The sum of the numbers covered with triangles is 1 + 4 + 7 = 12. The sum of the numbers covered with squares is 2 + 5 + 8 = 15. The number covered with the circle is 3. The sum of the numbers covered with the triangles equals the sum of the numbers covered with the squares. The number covered with the circle is half of the sum of the numbers covered with the triangles and the circle. The sum of the numbers covered with the triangles and the circle is 1 + 3 + 12 = 16.
