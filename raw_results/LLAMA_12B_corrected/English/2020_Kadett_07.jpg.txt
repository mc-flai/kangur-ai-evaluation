Reasoning: 
**Step 1: Understand the problem**

The question asks which option results in the smallest sum when Carlos squares the three chosen numbers from a list: -5, -3, -1, 0, 2, 7.

**Step 2: Identify all options**

A set of possible answers is given in letters (A) to (E), showing different combinations of three numbers to be squared from the list. They are:

(A) 0^2, -1^2, 2^2  
(B) -5^2, -3^2, 7^2  
(C) -5^2, -1^2, 2^2  
(D) -3^2, 0^2, 7^2  
(E) -1^2, 0^2, 2^2  

**Step 3: Solve and compare results**

Now we calculate the sum of squares for each option:

*(A) 0^2 + (-1)^2 + 2^2 = 0 + 1 + 4 = 5*  

*(B) (-5)^2 + (-3)^2 + 7^2 = 25 + 9 + 49 = 83*  

*(C) (-5)^2 + (-1)^2 + 2^2 = 25 + 1 + 4 = 30*  

*(D) (-3)^2 + 0^2 + 7^2 = 9 + 0 + 49 = 58*  

*(E) (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 0 + 4 = 5*  

**Step 4: Determine the smallest result**

Comparing the results, the smallest sum occurs in options (A) and (E).
