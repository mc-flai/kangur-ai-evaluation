Reasoning: To determine which of the given 4 x 4 squares cannot be made, we need to carefully examine each option. In this square, each cell contains a different color. Since there are four rows and four columns, each color must appear exactly four times. This criterion is met, so the square is valid. Each row and each column contains two cells with the same color. As there are four rows and four columns, there are also two rows and two columns with each color. However, this would result in one cell containing the same color, which is not the case. Therefore, this square cannot be made. In this square, each cell contains one of two colors. Each color appears exactly four times. Thus, every condition for a valid square is met. Every row and every column has a different number of cells with the same color (one row with three cells containing the same color and three rows with one cell containing the same color). Similarly, every column has a different number of cells with the same color. However, this would lead to the square having an odd number of a particular color, which violates a basic characteristic of 4 x 4 squares (each color must reappear, meaning that no row or column should have an odd number of its color). Thus, the square cannot be made. This square has one row and one column entirely filled with two colors. For the rows and columns with two different colors, each color appears exactly four times in each of these rows and columns. Therefore, every condition for a valid square is met.
