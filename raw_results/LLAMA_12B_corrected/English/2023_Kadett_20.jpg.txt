Reasoning: To solve question 20, we need to understand that the digits of a number are its individual parts, often represented numerically. The problem asks for the sum of the digits of the biggest of those numbers. The question indicates that the sum of 2023 consecutive integers is 2023 itself. This means that if we have a sequence of consecutive integers from 1 to 2023, the sum of all these integers would be equal to 2023. We can start by summing the first and last terms, which are both equal to 1. Since there are 2023 numbers in the sequence, each pair of numbers adds up to 2. Therefore, the total sum is equal to the number of pairs times 2, which is (2023 * 2) / 2 = 2023. Now, let's consider the digits of the biggest of those numbers. The number 2023 has three digits: 2, 0, and 3. To find the sum of the digits, we simply add these numbers together: 2 + 0 + 3 = 5. Therefore, the sum of the digits of the biggest of those numbers is 5. 

Answer: C) 5.
