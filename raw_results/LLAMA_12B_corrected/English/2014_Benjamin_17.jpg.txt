Reasoning: The problem states that Lea has marbles and needs to place them in small groups on the table. If she places them in groups of three, two marbles are left over. If she places them in groups of five, again two are left over. We need to determine how many more marbles Lea needs so that she can place them in groups of three as well as groups of five without any marbles being left over. Since we are looking for a number that can be divided evenly by both three and five, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of three and five. The LCM of 3 and 5 is 15. Let's check the answer choices to see if any of them match the LCM of 15. Option A) 3: This is the smallest number that can be divided by three but not five. Option B) 1: This is the smallest number that can be divided by one but not three or five. Option C) 4: This is not divisible by 3 or 5. Option D) 7: This is not divisible by 3 or 5. Option E) 13: This is not divisible by 3 or 5. Since the LCM of 3 and 5 is 15, we can conclude that Lea needs 15 more marbles so that she can place them in groups of three as well as groups of five without any marbles being left over.
