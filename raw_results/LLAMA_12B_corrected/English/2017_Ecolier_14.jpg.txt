Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the objective of each option and how it relates to Ben's request. We are given a set of 4 x 3 grids that Ben wants to cut into two identical pieces from one of the following shapes: (A) 3 shaped grid, (B) 2 shaped grid, (C) 4 shaped grid, (D) 5 shaped grid, (E) 3+1 shaped grid. Ben has a stove with two hobs on which he wants to prepare five different dishes. The dishes need 40 min, 15 min, 35 min, 10 min, and 45 min, respectively. The question asks for which shape Ben must write into the circle with the question mark. Since Ben has a stove with two hobs, we can assume that he will use each hob at different times to complete the dishes. The shapes provided (A, B, C, D, E) all have different areas that can be utilized to achieve the desired outcome. Based on the information given, it appears that options A, B, C, D, and E all have potential solutions for cutting the copies in any combination of their pieces. After analyzing all the options, I determined that all the options (A, B, C, D, E) are feasible for writing into the question mark in the circle, as they each have distinct characteristics that could help Ben achieve his goal. 

Answer: E)
