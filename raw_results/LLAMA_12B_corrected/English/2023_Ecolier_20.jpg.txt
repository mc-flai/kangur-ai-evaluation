Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the information provided in question 20. The problem states that five clocks are hanging on a wall, and one clock is one hour ahead, while another is one hour late and one is correct. Two clocks have stopped working. We are asked to identify which clock shows the correct time. To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step: 1. The first step is to identify the clocks that are one hour ahead and one hour late. Since there are only two clocks that are not stopped working, we can assume that one of them is the correct time and the other is either one hour ahead or one hour behind. 2. Let's analyze each option: - Option (A): Clock A shows 11:50. If it were one hour late, it would show 11:50 + 1 hour = 12:50. However, option A does not match any of the given clocks. - Option (B): Clock B shows 12:00. If it were one hour late, it would show 11:00, which is not correct. - Option (C): Clock C shows 12:50. If it were one hour late, it would show 11:50, which is not correct. - Option (D): Clock D shows 10:50. If it were one hour ahead, it would show 11:50, which matches option (A). - Option (E): Clock E shows 11:00. If it were one hour ahead, it would show 12:00, which is not correct. Based on the analysis, we can conclude that clock (D) is one hour ahead, and its correct time would be 11:50. Therefore, the reasoning behind choosing option (A) as the correct answer is that it perfectly matches the description provided in the problem statement.
