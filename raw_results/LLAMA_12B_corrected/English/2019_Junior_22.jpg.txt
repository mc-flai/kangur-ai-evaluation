Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of boxes that can be filled with equal amounts of apples and pears. Since there are 60 apples and 60 pears in total, each box should ideally contain half of these quantities. Let's calculate how many boxes can contain half of the total apples: **Apples:** 60 apples / 2 = 30 apples per box. Now, let's do the same for the pears: **Pears:** 60 pears / 2 = 30 pears per box. However, since we need to ensure that no two boxes have different amounts of fruits, we must consider the least common multiple (LCM) of the quantities for apples and pears. In this case, both apples and pears can form equal quantities of 30 each, which is already their respective halves. Therefore, we don't need to adjust anything further. Given this information, we know that: * A box can contain 30 apples and 30 pears. * The LCM of 30 for both apples and pears ensures even distribution across all boxes. Now, to determine the maximum number of boxes that can be filled, we can calculate the minimum number of boxes required to hold the maximum amount of each respective fruit individually, then select the smallest among them as our answer, as multiple boxes will always work towards this goal. For **apples**, considering 30 as the optimal amount per box: $$\left(\frac{60}{30}\right)=2$$ For **pears**, similarly: $$\left(\frac{60}{30}\right)=2$$ Both have 2 boxes as the minimum (and hence the maximum since we're maximizing boxes). Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be filled with the given quantities in an equal manner, according to the options, is **B) 15**, but based on the actualsto the direct approach we came up with, the output for such configuration OS fits the pattern well. Thus, the final answer, according to our initially chosen method and matches pattern like B), is:

Answer: B)
