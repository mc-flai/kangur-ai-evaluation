Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of similar triangles and the properties of circles. The key concept here is that when a tangent intersects a circle, it is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of intersection. The figure shows a tangent line TBP touching the circle at point P. We can draw a radius OP from the center of the circle to point P, which intersects the tangent line TBP. Notice that angle TPA is an exterior angle to triangle OAP. By the Exterior Angle Theorem, the measure of angle TPA is equal to the sum of the measures of angles PTA and PAT. Since PB is the angle bisector of angle TPA, it divides angle TPA into two equal parts. This means that angle OBP is half the measure of angle TPA. Since angle OBP is half the measure of angle TPA, and angle OAP is a right angle (because OT is tangent to the circle at P), we can conclude that angle TPA must be twice the value of angle OAP. We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information: Angle TPA + Angle PAT + Angle OAP = 180. Since angle OAP is a right angle (90 degrees), we can simplify the equation: Angle TPA + Angle PAT = 90. Since angle TPA is twice the value of angle OAP, we can substitute 2 times the value of angle OAP for angle TPA: 2 * Angle OAP + Angle PAT = 90. Simplified further, we get: 2 * 45° + Angle PAT = 90°. Angle PAT = 90° - 90°. Angle PAT = 45°. Based on the calculation above, angle PAT measures 45°.
