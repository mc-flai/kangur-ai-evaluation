Reasoning: To answer this question, we need to analyze the diagram and compare it with the given options. The diagram shows that Sonja has worked with four different apps in the previous week. This week, she has spent only half the amount of time using two of the apps and the same amount of time as last week using the other two apps. Let's analyze the diagram: The first app (A) has a total time of 6 units. The second app (B) has a total time of 7 units. The third app (C) has a total time of 8 units. The fourth app (D) has a total time of 10 units. Since Sonja spent only half the amount of time using two of the apps this week compared to last week, we can assume that the total time for these two apps is reduced by half. If we reduce the total time for each of these two apps by half, we get: App A: 6 / 2 = 3 units. App C: 8 / 2 = 4 units. 

Answer: C)
