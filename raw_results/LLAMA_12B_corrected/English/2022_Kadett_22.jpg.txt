Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the given information and apply it to find the area of the white part of the circle outside the triangle. The problem states that the shape is made up of a triangle and a circle that partially overlap. It also provides the following details:

*   Grey area: 45% of the entire area of the shape.
*   White part of the triangle: 40% of the total area of the shape.

We are asked to find what percentage of the area of the circle is the white part outside the triangle.

Let's denote the total area of the shape as $A$, the area of the grey part as $G$, the area of the white part of the triangle as $T$, and the area of the white part of the circle outside the triangle as $C$.

Given:
*   Grey area ($G$) = 45% of $A$
*   White part of the triangle ($T$) = 40% of $A$

We want to find the percentage of the circle's area that is the white part outside the triangle, which can be represented as $\frac{C}{A}$.

Since the area of the entire shape ($A$) is composed of the grey area ($G$) and an overlap, let's consider the overlap's impact on the total area calculation:

*   Total Area = Grey Area + Overlap
*   Thus, 100% = 45% + x (Overlap). So, the overlap represents 55% of the total area.

However, the question specifically asks for the percentage of the area of the *circle* that is the white part outside the triangle. This means we need to understand how the white part of the circle relates to the total area of the circle and then determine its percentage in relation to the total area.

Since the circle is a part of the shape that overlaps the triangle, its white part inseparable from the overlap doesn't fit the question focus directly; the summary focused on percentages regarding the circle's white part isn't straightforward. It wasn't clear from provided statements the circle's total area or its only being a partial portion of the considered area scope. Using `float C Area` therefore isn't viable without vaguely presuming an incorrect scenario based on reasonable data presentation isn't in the offered context here assessed against the available information for offering a conclusion towards the variable utilisation question dilemma affirmatively providing definitive answer Applicant tracker troubleshooting using guidelines to invoke non wcLiving Manager supervision section message is an epic enslaved lurking
