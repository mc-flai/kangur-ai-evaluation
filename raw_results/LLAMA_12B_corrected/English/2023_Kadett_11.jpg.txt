Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of substituting symbols for digits and then interpreting the new number correctly. The problem states that Dorli writes down three consecutive natural numbers in increasing order. She replaces the digits using symbols Δ (diamond), ∆ (inverted delta), and ∆∆ (double inverted delta). We need to figure out what these symbols represent. Δ likely represents the digit 0 (zero). ∆ probably represents the digit 1 (one). ∆∆ might represent the digit 2 (two). However, without further information or context about how these symbols are assigned, we must infer from the options provided. We are asked to choose the next bigger number in the sequence. The sequence so far, based on our initial interpretation, could be 010, 011, 122. However, this is speculative without clear guidance on the symbol-to-digit substitution pattern. Looking at the options, it seems most likely that each symbol corresponds to its position in the sequence of natural numbers (A for 1, B for 2, and so forth). Based on the pattern that each symbol appears to correspond to its natural number sequence position and considering the likely substitution we inferred, the "next bigger number" should logically be a sequence starting with an increasingly higher symbol representing a resting point (assuming our speculative pattern aligns with another number line interpretation phase, which might be incorrect or incomplete without clear rules from the problem statement). Given the lack of a definitive rule for substitution and the speculative approach we've taken, the answer becomes ambiguous. However, under normal conditions with clear instructions, one would typically review the options for a logical progression or combination that matches an incremental pattern. In this case, my speculative approach leads to ambiguity, but under typical scenarios or with clearer guidance on symbol substitution, one should revisit the pattern or seek clarification on symbolic conversion rules.
