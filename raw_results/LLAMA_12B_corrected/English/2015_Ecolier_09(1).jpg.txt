Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of moving objects and how it relates to subtracting different sizes to find the number that Luis gave to Jacob. **Initially**: Luis has 7 apples and 2 bananas. He gives 2 apples to his friend Jacob, who gives him bananas in return. Afterwards, Luis has got the same amounts of apples as bananas. **Key Information**: *   Luis starts with 7 apples and 2 bananas. *   Luis gives 2 apples to Jacob. *   After the trade, Luis has the same number of apples and bananas. **Step-by-Step Analysis**: 1.  Luis gives 2 apples to Jacob, so he is left with 7 - 2 = 5 apples. 2.  After receiving bananas, Luis now has 5 apples (the same number as bananas). **Conclusion**: The number that Luis gave to Jacob is the difference between the number of bananas he has after trading and the number of apples he had initially (2 bananas - 5 apples are not possible since the question states that he has an equal number of apples and bananas after the trade, but we know he started with only 2 bananas).
