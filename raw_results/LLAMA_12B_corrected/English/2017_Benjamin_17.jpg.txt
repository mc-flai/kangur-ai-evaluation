Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of a big cube and how it can be formed using 9 identical building blocks. A big cube can be formed by arranging the 9 building blocks such that each building block touches exactly 3 other blocks. This means we need to find a way to create a 3D structure with these blocks where each block has three neighbors. Let's analyze each option given in the question: A) The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 have to be written into the five fields of this diagram according to the rules stated below. We will come back to this option later after understanding the rules. B), C), D), and E) Offer possible arrangements of the building blocks. The correct arrangement will allow each building block to touch exactly three other blocks, forming the shape of a cube. Without drawing the actual arrangements, we can infer based on visual inspection or by understanding the concept: Options B, C, and E show variations where each building block could indeed be touching exactly three other blocks, thus forming a cube consistently throughout when all blocks are placed correctly. Given the information provided in the question and understanding the concept of forming a big cube from 9 identical building blocks, all options except D are viable methods to achieve this. Since the question asks for the possible arrangement and does not require us to prove it mathematically but just to identify a correct method, we look for the arrangement that clearly exhibits the characteristic of a cube.

Answer: D)
