Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between the numbers in the figure and how they are distributed in different parts of the pattern. The key information provided is that the sum of the three numbers in the horizontal row should be the same as the sum of the three numbers in the vertical column.

Let's analyze the pattern:

*   The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9 are written into the squares on the figure.
*   In the horizontal row, we have the numbers 1, 4, and 9.
*   In the vertical column, we have the numbers 2, 3, and 4.

The sum of the numbers in the horizontal row is 1 + 4 + 9 = 14. The sum of the numbers in the vertical column is 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.

Since the sums are not equal, we cannot directly use the information given about the sums being equal to determine the correct arrangement. However, we can see from the figure that the numbers are split into three identical pieces, with one piece being the top part (including the number 1), the middle piece (including the numbers 4 and 9), and the bottom part (including the other three numbers).

Given this, the only option that fits the criteria of the sums being equal or able to be made equal by rearranging the pieces is:

B) 2, 3, 4 is in the vertical column and 1, 4, 9 is in the horizontal row. This way, the sums would not be necessarily equal but rearranging the pieces as per the given instruction could potentially provide a valid arrangement where the sums are equal.

Answer: B)
