Reasoning: The question asks which animal is the winner in a competition where rabbits, beavers, and kangaroos have to find the shortest path. To answer this question, we must compare the movements of these three animals. A leap can be considered a single movement for a kangaroo or a rabbit where it jumps forward. Each move only goes forward, and they must only return to the starting point. For a beaver, a single movement consists of two forward movements in one direction with an elongation between them. The following instructions are provided: starts at a point and runs directly towards the endpoint. Upon reaching the endpoint, goes back to the starting point. A rabbit must take twice as many moves as a beaver to reach the end point and four moves for a kangaroo. A rabbit takes two moves (one move each way). So, twice as many moves as a beaver is 2*2. A kangaroo takes 4 moves (4*1). All make it to the other side and get 1- the number of moves they took to reach that point to get back to the startpoint. Total moves to cross side - if total 4 moves then 4 - 4 = ST all would have. However, both move twice to reach across. Every time you take four additional moves to get back. So, the ideal would be ST = 2x, which changes to = complete full distance because we use the same ending point both sides. Using the above information, these are all equivalent solutions: All three return to the starting point. All three have completed loops and started anew. A rabbit takes 6, a kangaroo takes 8 and a beaver takes 4. A kangaroo uses one jump for ever 2 that a beaver is hopping and therefore arrives earlier getInt the correct answers given go for solutions A, c and B since semitransfer completes in answer B, not C 3 that solution appropriately relates to solution presented solution.

Answer: No Answer.
