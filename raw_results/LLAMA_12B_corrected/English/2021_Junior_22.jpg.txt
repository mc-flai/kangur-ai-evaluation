Reasoning: To find the value of $(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)$, we need to simplify the expression and utilize the given information that $a+b+c=0$ and $abc=78$. 

1. **Use Vieta's Formulas**: Since $a+b+c=0$, we can use Vieta's formulas for a cubic equation. This tells us that the sum of the roots is zero.

2. **Relate Expression to Product of Roots**: The expression $(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)$ is related to the product of the roots of the cubic equation. We need to express this product in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$.

3. **Expand Expression**: Expanding the expression gives us $$(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = (ab+ac+bc)^2 - a^2b^2 - b^2c^2 - c^2a^2.$$

4. **Simplify Using $abc=78$**: We know that $abc=78$. Using this, we can simplify our expression by substituting $abc$ back into our expanded form. Given $abc=78$, we have $$(ab+ac+bc) = a^2b + b^2c + c^2a.$$

5. **Apply Vieta's Formulas to Simplify**: Since $a+b+c=0$, $abc=78$. By applying Vieta's formulas again, we find that $$(ab+ac+bc) = -(a^3+b^3+c^3).$$

6. **Find Volume of the Rectangular Box**: The volume of a rectangular box with dimensions $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $abc$. Therefore, $$-(a^3+b^3+c^3) = 3\cdot заход.$$

7. **Calculate Answer**: Substituting this back gives us $$(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = [(a+b+c) + a^2b + b^2c + c^2a][(a+b+c)+3ab(a+b+c)+3bc(a+b+c)]$$ $$= [(0)+3\cdot засть](a+b+c),$$ which simplifies to $$(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 56[0] = 0.$$ Given this information, the correct answer is None.

Answer: No Answer.
