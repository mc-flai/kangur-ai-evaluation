Reasoning: The problem asks us to find the minimum number of cells in a 5 x 5 grid that must be colored in such a way that every possible 1 x 4 rectangle and every 4 x 1 rectangle has at least one cell coloured in. The grid is 5 x 5, so there are 25 cells in total. We need to color cells such that every possible 1 x 4 rectangle and every 4 x 1 rectangle has at least one cell colored in. For a 1 x 4 rectangle, there are three possible orientations: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal. For a 4 x 1 rectangle, there are four possible orientations: horizontal, vertical, and two diagonals. We need to ensure that at least one cell in each of these rectangles is colored. To ensure that every possible 1 x 4 rectangle has at least one cell colored, we need to place at least one cell in each column and each row. To ensure that every possible 4 x 1 rectangle has at least one cell colored, we need to place at least one cell in each row and each column. However, if we place one cell in each column and row, this would cover all possible rectangles, but we would not need to place additional cells. Based on the analysis above, the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is equal to the number of columns and rows, which is 5 x 5 = 25.
