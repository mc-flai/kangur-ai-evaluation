Reasoning: To answer question 2, we need to analyze the given data and identify the correct answer from the options. Based on the given data, we can see that Diana throws two darts, three times at the target board. The number of points depends on which one of the three areas she hits. We can calculate the expected number of points for each possible combination of hits: Two hits in Area 1: 28 points (2 x 14), Two hits in Area 2: 32 points (2 x 16), One hit in Area 1 and one in Area 2: 30 points (1 x 14 + 1 x 16). Based on the calculations, we can see that the expected number of points varies depending on which areas Diana hits. Therefore, the correct answer is: This answer includes all possible combinations of hits, as each option represents a different scenario: two hits in Area 1, two hits in Area 2, one hit in Area 1 and one in Area 2, or one hit in Area 3 and two hits in Area 1 (although this last scenario is directly mentioned, the probability might be minimal, but combinations might appear when traditions try to interpret possible outcomes differently).

Answer: No Answer.
