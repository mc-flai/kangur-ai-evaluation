Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the instructions given for the dog's path. The instruction is: "In order to get to his bone, the dog has to follow the black line. In total he turns 3-times to the right and 2-times to the left." This implies that the dog must follow a specific sequence of turns to reach its destination. Let's examine each option: A) The dog turns right, then left, then right again, and finally turns right one more time. This sequence includes 3 turns to the right and 1 turn to the left, which does not match the instructions. B) The dog turns right, then right again, then left, and finally turns right once more. This sequence includes 4 turns to the right and 1 turn to the left, which also does not match the instructions. C) The dog turns right, then left, then right, and finally turns left once more. This sequence includes 3 turns to the right and 2 turns to the left, which matches the instructions. D) The dog turns right, then left, then right, and finally turns left once more. This sequence includes 4 turns to the right and 2 turns to the left, which does not match the instructions. E) The dog turns right, then left, then right, and finally turns left once more. This sequence includes 4 turns to the right and 2 turns to the left, which does not match the instructions. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is: 

Answer: C)
