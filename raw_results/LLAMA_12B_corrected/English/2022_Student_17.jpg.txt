Reasoning: To solve question 17, we need to understand the problem correctly. The question states that there are 8 participants randomly paired up in four teams for the first round and then proceed to the second round, where two games of the second round are played, and the two winners play the final match. Anita and Martina are the two best players and will win against all others; in case they have to play against each other, Anita will win. The question asks for the probability that Martina will get to the final. Let's analyze this step by step: In the first round, each participant is paired up with another participant, so there are 4 teams of 2 players each. In the second round, the winners of each team play against each other. Since Anita is a top player, she will win her game with a high probability. Let's assume she wins her game with a probability of 0.8 (80%). Martina is also a top player, so she will also win her game with a high probability. Let's assume she wins her game with a probability of 0.8 (80%). Since both Anita and Martina win their games with a probability of 0.8, the probability that Anita wins Martina's game is 0.8 x 0.2 = 0.16 (16%). Now, let's consider the final round. If Anita wins Martina's game, then only one of them can reach the final. The probability that Anita reaches the final is 0.16. If Martina wins Anita's game, then she will reach the final with a probability of 0.2 (since she has a 20% chance of winning against Anita). Therefore, the total probability that Martina reaches the final is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.16 + 0.2 = 0.3 (30%). The closest answer choice to this result is (D). 
Answer: D)
