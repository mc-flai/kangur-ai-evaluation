Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the question and understand what it is asking. The question asks how many cm is the belt longer if it is only closed in the first hole instead of in all 5 holes. The diagram shows a belt with 5 holes, each representing 2 cm. If the belt is closed in all 5 holes, it would be 10 cm long (2 cm x 5 holes). However, if it is only closed in the first hole, it would be 6 cm long (2 cm + 4 cm). Therefore, the belt is 4 cm longer when closed in the first hole instead of all 5 holes.  
Answer: C) 4
