Reasoning: If Alex has eaten a cake, they would have said something like "I have eaten a cake." Since Alex only said "I did not eat a cake," this implies that Alex did not eat a cake. This information is not strong enough to determine who has eaten the cake, but it helps us rule out Alex as the person who has eaten it.

We can then look at the statements made by Bartek, Dani, Emil, and Cora. Bartek said "I ate a cake," which implies that he has eaten a cake. However, this could be a lie, and we cannot be sure if he has actually eaten one.

Dani said "I did not eat a cake," which implies that they have not eaten a cake.

Emil said "Alex has eaten a cake," which suggests that Alex has eaten a cake, but this statement is not trustworthy since it is second-hand information.

Cora did not make a statement about eating a cake. Since we know that Alex, Dani, and Emil did not eat a cake, this implies that Bartek must have eaten a cake (or lied about eating one).
