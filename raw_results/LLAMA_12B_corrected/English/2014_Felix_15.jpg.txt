Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to use the concept of Sudoku or color blocking. Ingrid has 4 red cubes, 3 blue cubes, 2 green cubes, and 1 yellow cube that she uses to build the object. The question asks which color the cube with the question mark should be. The goal is to find a color for the cube that ensures that cubes with the same color do not touch each other. Step 1: Analyze the given information. Ingrid has 4 red cubes, 3 blue cubes, 2 green cubes, and 1 yellow cube. We need to use these cubes to build the object. Step 2: Identify the constraints. Cubes with the same color cannot touch each other. Step 3: Apply the constraints to the given options. Let's analyze each option: (A) If the cube with the question mark is red, it would touch at least one of the other red cubes. (B) If the cube with the question mark is blue, it would touch at least one of the other blue cubes. (C) If the cube with the question mark is green, it would touch at least one of the other green cubes. (D) If the cube with the question mark is yellow, it would touch at least one of the other yellow cubes. (E) This cannot be worked out for certain - This option implies that there is no color that satisfies the constraint of not touching cubes of the same color. Step 4: Conclusion. Based on the constraints and the given options, we can conclude that:

Answer: E)
