**Reasoning:**

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the time taken for the motorboat to travel from X to Y and the time taken for the tree trunk to float in the middle of the stream from X to Y.

Let's denote:

*   T пройd = time taken by the motorboat to travel from X to Y
*   T tr = time taken by the tree trunk to float from X to Y

We know that:

*   Downstream, the motorboat needs 4 hours to get from X to Y.
*   Back upstream, it needs 6 hours.

The speed of the motorboat downstream is faster than upstream because it's aided by the current. The same current that helps the motorboat also helps the tree trunk float downstream faster.

Let's denote the speed of the motorboat as "S" and the speed of the tree trunk as "St". The speed of the current can be represented as a fraction of the motorboat's speed, given that the time taken is inversely proportional to the speed.

Given that it takes the motorboat 4 hours to go downstream, and 6 hours to go upstream (against the current), we can establish the relationship:

\[ \frac{Speed}{Speed + Current速度} \times Time \ Downstream = Time \ Upstream \]

For the motorboat going downstream:

\[ \frac{S}{S + C} \times 4 = T_{}} \ downúcious} \]

For the motorboat going upstream:

\[ \frac{S}{S - C} \times 6 = Tuş‰ \}

We don't have direct values for S and C yet, but we can relate the times given in the options directly to the situation.

Looking at the options, we see they represent various combinations of the two speeds multiplied by their respective times.

Without explicit calculation steps but knowing the logic above, tying the motorboat's journey times with the tree's floating time helps achieve a solution. Since the correct answer isn't directly derived from a single given option without assuming one as true, we'd typically solve for variables if we had them. However, given the nature of this setup and expected solution type, we can infer appropriate choices based on logical deductions.
