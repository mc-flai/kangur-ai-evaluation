Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the sequence of rope cutting and knotting performed by Charles. Charles starts with a rope divided into 3 equal pieces. He makes one knot in one piece and two knots in the other. Then, in the third piece, he creates 3 knots. Finally, he lays the three pieces down in a random order. The question is asking us to determine which arrangement of the three pieces is correct based on the description provided. The correct arrangement must reflect the sequence of knots created by Charles: one piece with one knot, another with two knots, and the last piece with three knots. A) This option does not accurately depict the sequence of knots as described by Charles. B) This option incorrectly places the piece with 2 knots before the piece with 3 knots, violating the given instructions. C) This option correctly places the piece with 1 knot where Charles describes making one knot in one of the pieces. D) This option incorrectly places the piece with 3 knots before the piece with 1 knot, again violating the instructions. E) This option accurately arranges the pieces according to the sequence described by Charles. Based on the provided instructions and the correct sequence of knotting specified by Charles, the correct answer is **(E)**.

Answer: E)
