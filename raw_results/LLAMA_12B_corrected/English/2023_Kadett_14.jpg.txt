Reasoning: To determine the minimum number of red edges that the cube has, we need to consider the possible number of faces on a cube and how they can be colored. A cube has six faces, each of which can be colored with either red or white. The number of ways to color these faces gives us the total number of distinct arrangements. Since each face can be colored with two colors (red or white), the total number of possible arrangements is $2^6 = 64$. This counts every possible combination of red and white colors for each of the six faces. Now, we need to find out how many of these arrangements result in a cube with the minimum number of red edges. If all faces are white, there are no red edges. If all faces are red, there are no white edges (all red edges). If exactly one face is red, then there is one red edge. The other five faces must be white. If exactly two faces are red, then they share an edge and form a pair of opposite faces. This results in three pairs of opposite faces (each pair consists of two identical triangles). Since these pairs are not adjacent, each has only one red edge. Now, considering the given conditions: there is only one way to form a single edge with red color L3·45·6. So there must be at least six edges without red color L6 with 6 matches. Hence, the total number of ways to form exactly 6 matches gives us:  |D)8 Therefore, the answer is (D) 8.
