Reasoning: **Step 1: Understand the problem** The question asks how many different orders are there for three boys (Hermann, Felix, and Clemens) to enter a room one after the other. **Step 2: Analyze the problem** Since there are three boys, they can each enter the room in one of six possible positions. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not take into account that Hermann cannot be the first, Felix cannot be the second, and Clemens cannot be the third. **Step 3: Calculate the number of orders** There are three possible choices for the first position: Hermann, Felix, or Clemens. Once the first position is filled, there are two possible choices left for the second position. After filling the second position, there is one boy left for the third position. **Step 4: Calculate the total number of orders** To find the total number of orders, we multiply the number of choices for each position: 3 * 2 * 1 = 6. **Final Answer** The correct answer is 6. This represents the six different orders in which the three boys can enter the room: Hermann-Felix-Clemens, Hermann-Clemens-Felix, Felix-Hermann-Clemens, Felix-Clemens-Hermann, Clemens-Hermann-Felix, and Clemens-Felix-Hermann.
