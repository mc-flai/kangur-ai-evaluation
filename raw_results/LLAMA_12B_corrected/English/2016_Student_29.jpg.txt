Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the constraints and conditions of the chessboard coloring problem described in the question. The chessboard is divided into 25 fields in a 5 x 5 grid. All fields are initially colored white. The allowed move changes the color of three adjacent fields (either horizontally or vertically) to black, and vice versa. Since we start with a purely white chessboard and the only valid moves are to turn adjacent fields black or turn adjacent black fields white, the goal is to turn all fields black. To do this, each move of turning three fields black requires a corresponding move to turn back the adjacent same-colored fields white after each step, effectively canceling out those moves' impact on the overall change. The first move can turn 3 fields black, turning the rest white. Then, for each subsequent move, we would aim to achieve similar changes with a net effect of 1 new field turned black or white in total. Since the total number of fields is 25, and we "reset" or cancel the effects of turns through each move by only changing three fields and their adjacencies, the minimum number of moves to cover all fields at least once is equivalent to the maximum number of change opportunities, which is 12 (since in a 5x5 grid, there are 4 corners that can only change once effectively). 

- (A) less than 10: Incorrect because even considering the corners, achieving a full cycle of color change across the board in fewer moves than the number of total changes needed seems challenging.
- (B) 10: Incorrect because with a signals-based move and no limitation on flipping, it actually could take more before covering all squares with a fully alternating pattern.
- (C) 12: Correct because we deduced that it takes at least 12 moves to ensure all fields are flipped once under the specified move condition.
- (D) more than 12: Incorrect because we established that 12 moves should be sufficient.
- (E) This coloring cannot be obtained: Incorrect because we determined that such coloring is achievable with specific moves.
