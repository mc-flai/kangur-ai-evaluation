Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the given image and identify the correct tile that completes the wall. The given image shows a part of a wall with some tiles missing. The missing tile is indicated by a white box. We are asked to choose the correct tile from the given options. Let's analyze each option: A) This tile has a similar design to the existing tiles in the wall, with four round shapes arranged in a square pattern. It seems like this tile would fit well into the empty space. B) This tile has a different design, with two intersecting lines forming an "X" shape. It doesn't seem to match the design of the existing tiles. C) This tile also has a different design, with two curved lines that don't match the shape of the existing tiles. D) This tile has a similar design to option A, with four round shapes arranged in a square pattern. However, it's slightly smaller than the existing tiles. E) This tile has a similar design to option A, but it's rotated 90 degrees clockwise compared to the existing tiles. Based on our analysis, we can conclude that option A is the correct answer. The tile with the four round shapes arranged in a square pattern is the best match for the empty space in the wall.
