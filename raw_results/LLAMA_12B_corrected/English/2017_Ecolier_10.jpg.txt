Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to compare the weight of apples and pears. The problem states that "Four apples and one pear weigh as much as three pears." Let's denote the weight of one apple as $a$ and the weight of one pear as $p$. We know that four apples weigh the same as three pears, so we can write the equation: $$4a = 3p$$ Now, let's analyze the options: (A) One pear weighs as much as one apple. This option suggests that the weight of one apple is equal to the weight of one pear, which would mean $a = p$. However, this contradicts our initial equation $4a = 3p$. (B) Three apples weigh as much as one pear. This option suggests that the weight of three apples is equal to the weight of one pear, which would mean $3a = p$. Substituting this into our initial equation, we get: $$4a = 3p \Rightarrow 4a = 3(3a) \Rightarrow 4a = 9a$$ This implies $a = 0$, which is an invalid answer since an object cannot have zero weight. (C) Three pears weigh as much as two apples and one pear. This option suggests that the weight of two apples plus one pear is equal to the weight of three pears, which is not consistent with our initial equation $4a = 3p$. (D) Two pears weigh as much as one apple. This option suggests that the weight of one apple is equal to the combined weight of two pears, which would mean $a = 2p$. Substituting this into our initial equation, we get: $$4a = 3p \Rightarrow 4(2p) = 3p \Rightarrow 8p = 3p$$ This also implies $\boxed{p = 0}$, which, like option B), is an invalid answer. (E) Two apples weigh as much as one pear. This option suggests that the weight of one pear is equal to the combined weight of two apples, which is consistent with our initial equation $4a = 3p \Rightarrow 2a = 1.5p$. Dividing both sides by $3/2$, we get $a = p/2 \Rightarrow 2a = p$. Substituting this into our initial equation, we verify that it holds true.
