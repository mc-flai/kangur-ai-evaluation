Reasoning: To solve question 26, we need to analyze the pattern in the image and determine which number corresponds to the circle. The pattern consists of ten circles arranged in two rows. The first row has five circles, and the second row also has five circles. Each circle is labeled with a number from 1 to 10. The question mark is located at the end of the second row, which corresponds to the circle with the label "10". Let's eliminate the options that do not match the correct answer: Option A) 2: This number corresponds to the first circle in the first row, not the circle corresponding to the question mark. Option B) 4: This number corresponds to the second circle in the first row, not the circle corresponding to the question mark. Option C) 5: This number corresponds to the third circle in the first row, not the circle corresponding to the question mark. Option D) 6: This number corresponds to the fourth circle in the first row, not the circle corresponding to the question mark. Option E) Ano Other Number: This option is correct because the question mark corresponds to the circle with the label "10", which is not listed among the options A) to D).

Answer: E)
