Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to find the age difference between the father and son when the father's age is represented by the whole number part of the fraction 2015, and the son's age is represented by the fractional part. The fraction 2015 can be broken down into prime factors: 2015 = 5 * 13 * 31. This means that the father's age is a multiple of 5, 13, and 31. The ages of both the father and son are whole numbers, so their combined age is a multiple of all these prime factors. To find the age difference between them, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 5, 13, and 31. The LCM of 5, 13, and 31 is 5 * 13 * 31 = 4035. Therefore, the age difference between the father and son is 4035 years. Since the whole number age of the father is multiplied by the whole number age of the son, one obtains 2015, which is less than half of the LCM (4035 / 2 = 2017.5), both are born in the 20th century. The correct answer is 26 years. 75 explanation 75.
