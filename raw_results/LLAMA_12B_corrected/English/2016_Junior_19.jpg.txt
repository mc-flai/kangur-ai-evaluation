Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of all the marked angles in the diagram. The given angles are: A = 315°, B = 330°, C = 345°, D = 360°, E = 375°. Now, let's add these angles together: A + B + C + D + E = 315° + 330° + 345° + 360° + 375°. Using a calculator, we get: A + B + C + D + E = 1735°. However, since we are dealing with angles on a flat surface, the sum of all angles should be a multiple of 360° (a full circle). We can simplify 1735° by subtracting multiples of 360°: 1735° - 4 * 360° = 5°.
