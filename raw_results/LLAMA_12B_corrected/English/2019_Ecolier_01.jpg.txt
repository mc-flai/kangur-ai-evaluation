Reasoning: To determine which number got third place, we need to look at the ranking of the individuals on the podium. The individual with the highest rank stands on the top step of the podium, and the lower their rank, the closer they are to the bottom step. From the given options: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5. We can see that the individual with the highest rank (E) stands on the top step of the podium, followed by the individual with the second-highest rank (D), and then the individual with the third-highest rank (C). Therefore, the individual with the third-highest rank, or third place, is (C) 3.
