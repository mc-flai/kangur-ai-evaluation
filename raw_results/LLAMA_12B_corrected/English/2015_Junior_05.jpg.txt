Reasoning: To find the area where Mr. Hide has to look for the treasure, we need to calculate the area of each rectangle and compare them. The picture shows five different rectangles formed by the hedge and the pear tree. The smallest rectangle is formed by the hedge and the ground (A), with dimensions 5 m x 1 m = 5 square meters. The largest rectangle is formed by the hedge, the pear tree, and the ground (E), with dimensions 5 m x (1 m + 2 m) = 9 square meters. The other rectangles are: B) 3 m x 2 m = 6 square meters; C) 4 m x 2 m = 8 square meters; D) 3 m x 3 m = 9 square meters. But the rectangle with the largest area is E), which is 9 square meters. Therefore, the correct answer is E).

Answer: E).
