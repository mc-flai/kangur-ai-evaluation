Reasoning: To find the answer, we need to calculate the total area of the rectangle and triangle, then subtract the shaded area that lies outside the triangle. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. The area of a triangle is calculated using the formula Area = (base * height) / 2. **Step 1: Calculate the area of the rectangle** Length = 6 cm Width = 10 cm Area of the rectangle = length * width = 6 * 10 = 60 square cm **Step 2: Calculate the area of the triangle** Base = 6 cm Height = 6 cm Area of the triangle = (base * height) / 2 = (6 * 6) / 2 = 18 square cm **Step 3: Calculate the total area of the rectangle and triangle** Total area = Area of the rectangle + Area of the triangle = 60 + 18 = 78 square cm **Step 4: Subtract the shaded area from the total area** Shaded area = 18 square cm Resulting grey area = Total area - Shaded area = 78 - 18 = 60 square cm **Step 5: Choose the appropriate option based on the calculation** Based on the calculation, the resulting grey area is 60 square cm, which corresponds to option C) 14 cm^2.

Answer: C) 14 cm^2
