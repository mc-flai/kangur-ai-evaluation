Reasoning: To determine the perimeter of the shape, we need to calculate the total length of all its sides. The shape consists of 6 squares with side length 1. To find the perimeter, we need to count the number of sides and multiply it by the length of each side. There are 6 squares in the shape. Each square has 4 sides, so the total number of sides is 6 * 4 = 24. The length of each side is 1. Therefore, the perimeter is 24 * 1 = 24.

Answer: A) 24
