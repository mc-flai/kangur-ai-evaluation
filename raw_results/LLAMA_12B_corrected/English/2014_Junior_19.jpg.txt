Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the game of chess and how points are awarded. The key points to understand are:

* A win gives 1 point.
* A draw gives 1/2 point.
* A loss gives 0 points.

The question asks how many more matches the player needs to win than he loses to reach a total of 40 matches and 25 points.

Let's analyze the possible outcomes:

* If the player wins x matches, he loses y matches, and draws z matches, then the total points he has is x + (1/2)z.
* Since the total points are 25, we can set up the equation: x + (1/2)z = 25.
* We also know that the total number of matches is x + y + z = 40.

Now, let's consider the options:

A) 5
B) 7
C) 10
D) 12
E) 15

We can plug in each option into the equation and see which one satisfies both conditions.

After trying all the options, we find that option D) 12 matches is the correct answer. This means the player needs to win 12 more matches than he loses to reach a total of 40 matches and 25 points.

Answer: D) 12
