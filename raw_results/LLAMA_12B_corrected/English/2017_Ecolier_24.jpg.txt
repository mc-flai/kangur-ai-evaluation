Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the problem and then use logic to arrive at the solution. Here's my step-by-step reasoning: The problem states that Leonie has hidden a Smiley behind some of the grey boxes. The numbers stated how many Smileys there are in the neighboring boxes. Two boxes are neighboring if they have one side or one corner in common. Looking at the table, we can see that there are 5 adjacent boxes, each with a different number of Smileys. The numbers are: 3, 2, 2, 1, and 2. Since two boxes are neighboring if they have one side or one corner in common, we can analyze the adjacent boxes. For example, the box with 3 Smileys is adjacent to the boxes with 2, 2, 1, and 2 Smileys. Using this information, we can see that the box with 3 Smileys has 5 Smileys (2 + 2 + 1). This means that the total number of Smileys hidden by Leonie is 5. Therefore, the correct answer is D) 8. However, we need to check the answer options to see if there is any other option that matches our calculation. Let's go through each option: Option A) 4: This is less than the total number of Smileys we calculated. Option B) 5: This is equal to the total number of Smileys we calculated, but it's not listed as an answer option. Option C) 7: This is more than the total number of Smileys we calculated. Option E) 11: This is much more than the total number of Smileys we calculated. Therefore, the Correct Answer is not D) 8, but another option is correct within the given choices.  
Answer: No Answer.
