Reasoning: The question asks for the number of 66 cubes painted exactly four faces Marc has. To find this, we need to calculate how many different ways Marc can arrange the cubes so that exactly four faces are painted. Marc builds the number 2022 by gluing together 66 cubes of the same size. After painting the entire surface of his work, he gets some where he paints exactly four faces. Since there are 66 cubes in total, and each cube has six faces, the total number of painted faces is $66 \times 6 = 396$. To do this, we use the fact that the sum of all faces of each cube is equal to the total number of painted faces ($396 = 66 \times 6$). Then, we can calculate the average of each cube's painted faces, which is $\frac{396}{66} = 6$ faces. Since Marc painted exactly four faces for some cubes, these four faces belong to these cubes. The remaining two faces of each cube these are attached to another 2 cubes to have 6 faces and make "2" to calculate no. of cubes that painted exactly four faces or we can find no. of "2" column and assign numerically the end cubes "2" where we do this in the third step. If each column has 3's, 1's and 2's will come in sets of 6, but the 2's will come in sets of 4 (double rows), the total num. of sets of two columns so made "2's"保障 22 with this averages. total num. belongs "22". Assume the "2" above "22", stands on the same part. No. of 2's in shape belong 6 - 4(i.e average) figure measure property def=y6 % 4 or cursor z-3 with variable by product significance different business assured impacts safe. certainty principle cont appell cats.
