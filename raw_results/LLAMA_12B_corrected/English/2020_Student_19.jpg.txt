Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometric relationship between a circle and a rectangle. A circle is tangent to one side of the rectangle and passes through two of its vertices, as shown in the figure. Let's denote the side length of the rectangle as **x** and the height of the rectangle as **y**. Since the circle is tangent to one side of the rectangle, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the rectangle, which is **x**. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius of the circle, which is half of the diameter: **Radius = x/2**. The area of the rectangle is given by: **Area = x \* y**. We are told that the area of the rectangle is **20 cm^2**, so we have: **x \* y = 20**. We also know that the circle passes through two of the vertices of the rectangle. The distance from the center of the circle to the vertices is equal to the radius. Since the circle intersects the top and bottom edges of the rectangle, the distance from the center to the top edge is half the height of the rectangle, which is **y/2**. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can set up an equation: **(x/2)^2 + (y/2)^2 = x^2**. Simplifying and rearranging, we get: **x^2 - y^2 = 4**. Now we have two equations: **x \* y = 20** and **x^2 - y^2 = 4**. Solving these simultaneous equations, we find that **x = 5** and **y = 4**. So, the sides of the rectangle have lengths **5 cm** and **4 cm**.
