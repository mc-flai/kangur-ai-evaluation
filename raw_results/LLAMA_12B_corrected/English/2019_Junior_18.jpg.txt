Reasoning: To solve question 18, we need to determine the fraction of syrup that should be used to obtain 2 liters of juice. The given ratio is 1:7 (syrup:juice). To find out how much syrup is needed for 2 liters of juice, we need to multiply the amount of syrup in the ratio by the ratio of juice. The ratio of syrup to juice is 1:7, so for every 7 parts of juice, there is 1 part of syrup. To get 2 liters of juice, we need to multiply the amount of syrup by 2/7, since 2 liters is twice the amount of juice in the ratio. Let's calculate the amount of syrup needed: Amount of syrup = (2/7) x 1 (amount of syrup in the ratio) = 2/7. Therefore, the fraction of syrup that should be used to obtain 2 liters of juice is 2/7.

Answer: D) 2/7
