Reasoning: To solve this problem, let's consider the possible combinations of handshaking between Erika and each of the other four individuals at the party. 

1. **Erika with Anna:** There's only one way they can shake hands, once.

2. **Erika with Bella:** Since Anna shook hands with Bella twice, Bella shook hands with Anna twice as well. Therefore, Erika can shake hands with Bella twice.

3. **Erika with Claire:** Claire shook hands with Dora four times, implying she could have shaken hands with any of the other people four times as well if they were all present simultaneously. However, since Erika only shakes hands once with each person, Claire's role in determining Erika's possible handshakes is that Claire could technically be a candidate for a handshake with Erika up to four times based on Claire's interactions. This doesn't directly limit Erika's options beyond what we know about her in relation to other interactions but indicates a potential flexibility in Claire's interactions that could under normal circumstances offer up to four possibilities if all candidates (including Claire herself) were equally likely as candidates for a handshake with Erika based on prior interactions alone.

4. **Erika with Dora:** Given Dora shook hands exactly four times and considering she has already met twice with Claire (her four meetings), this means there's one more handshake left for Dora to use on another person. Since we're only considering Dora as needing one more unique handshake beyond her two meetings with Claire, this doesn't add any additional handshakes with Erika beyond the fact that without any other specifics, Dora could technically fit in one more handshake overall, potentially with Erika, but it does not directly dictate a new unique handshake option for Erika.

Considering these points, it seems there might be confusion in interpreting how specific interactions affect total possibilities across the question as written. Without specific information limiting who Erika can handshake with based directly on given numbers potentially overlapping or limiting certain combinations of handshakes beyond just knowing everyone has equal opportunity for one handshake each (as the question implies), we acknowledge that direct interpretations of given handshake limits from participants other than Erika or non-quantified interactions (like Beth or any others not mentioned) complicate determining exact number combinations directly from those given data to simplify to a single definitive handshake count with one of these directly based on straightforward observations of their direct interactions figures internally stated. Therefore, following the conceptual capture within question scope strictly as per participants comprised limit
