Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of 3D shapes and their volumes. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the properties of a cube and its volume. A standard cube has 8 corners, and each corner is shared by three faces. This means that if we take one cube and remove one corner from it, we are left with a total of 7 corners. However, since the corners are shared, they actually contribute to only 6 faces. Therefore, if we remove one corner from each of the original 125 cubes, we will have 7 corners in total after removing all the corners. Based on the above analysis, it is clear that option (C) is the correct answer. With the removal of one corner from each cube, we end up with exactly 42 corners in the 3x3x3 cube, which corresponds to option (C). The reasoning behind this solution involves understanding the properties of 3D shapes, specifically cubes, and how their corners contribute to the total number of faces. By analyzing the process of removing a corner from each cube and counting the resulting corners, we can determine the correct answer.

Answer: C)
