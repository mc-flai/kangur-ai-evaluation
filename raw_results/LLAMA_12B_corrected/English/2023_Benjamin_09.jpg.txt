Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the rules of rolling a die. The rules are:

* If the even number is rolled and it's a multiple of 2 or 4, it shows a white color
* If the even number is rolled and it's not a multiple of 2 or 4, it shows a black color
* If the odd number is rolled, it shows a gray color

Let's analyze each option:

A) 2/2

Since 2 is an even number and it's not a multiple of 2 or 4, it will show a black color on top of a black circle.

B) 4/2

Since 4 is an even number and it's a multiple of 2 or 4, it will show a white color on top of a white circle.

C) 6/2

Since 6 is an even number and it's a multiple of 2 or 4, it will show a white color on top of a white circle.

D) 3/2

Since 3 is an odd number, it will show a gray color on top of a gray circle.

E) 6/3

Since 6 is an even number and it's a multiple of 3, but not a multiple of 2 or 4, it will show a black color on top of a black circle.

Based on these rules, the correct answer is:

Answer: A) 2/2
