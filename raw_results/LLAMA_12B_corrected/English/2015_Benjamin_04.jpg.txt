Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the daily egg-laying pattern of the ducks. According to the information given:

*   5 of the 10 ducks lay an egg every day.
*   The other 5 ducks lay an egg every second day.

First, let's find out how many eggs the 5 ducks that lay an egg every day will lay in 10 days:

*   Since they lay an egg every day, they will lay 5 eggs each day for 10 days.
*   So, these ducks will lay a total of 5 eggs/day * 10 days = 50 eggs.

Next, let's calculate how many eggs the other 5 ducks that lay an egg every second day will lay in 10 days:

*   These ducks lay an egg every second day, so in 10 days, they will lay an egg 5 times (since 10 days divided by 2 is 5).
*   Therefore, these ducks will lay a total of 5 eggs * 5 times = 25 eggs.

Now, we add the total eggs laid by both groups of ducks to find out the overall number of eggs laid after 10 days:

*   50 eggs (from the first group) + 25 eggs (from the second group) = 75 eggs.

Therefore, the total number of eggs laid by the 10 ducks after 10 days is 75. We broke down the problem into understanding how many eggs are laid daily by each group of ducks and then calculated the total number of eggs laid over the 10-day period by adding their contributions.

Answer: A) 75
