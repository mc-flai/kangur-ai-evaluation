Reasoning: To determine the number of planes that intersect exactly three vertices of a given cube, we can think about the geometry and structure of a cube. A cube has 8 vertices and 12 edges. To find planes that intersect exactly three vertices, we should consider how many triangles can be formed by connecting three vertices.

Each face of the cube is a square, which means each face has four vertices. If we pick any three vertices from the same face, there are not going to be any planes that go through these vertices alone because there would be lines or edges connecting these vertices directly. However, if we select three vertices from different faces, we can form a plane by connecting these three points.

There are several sets of three vertices that can form planes when chosen from different faces of a cube:

1.  **Top, Middle Front, Bottom**: Selecting vertices from the top face, middle front face, and bottom face can form a plane. There are 4 ways to choose the top vertex (any of the 4 top points), 4 ways to choose the middle front vertex, and then only 1 way to choose the bottom vertex because it must match up with both the top and the middle front to make a plane. This gives us 4 * 4 = 16 planes. However, each plane is counted multiple times, so we divide by the number of ways to arrange the three vertices. Since there are 3 vertices and each can be chosen in only one way, the arrangements are counted, but it doesn't change the count because we are specifically looking at combinations here, not permutations. Since each set of three vertices forms a unique plane regardless of the order you pick them in, the initial count is actually accurate without further division by 3 or 6 (as would be necessary if permuting them also created new planes, which isn't the case in this analysis).
2.  ** Pendant Vertices from Different Triangular Faces**: For this method, choose vertex A from the top face. Then, pick any other vertex (except from the top face itself or vertex A) to form a plane; you can choose 4 such points (forming a net over three adjacent vertices of a triangular face of the perspective of the cube), then for each chosen point, you have 4 points to choose again for the third vertex of your plane, yielding 16 for this set, excluding duplicates from other sets besides along faces.
