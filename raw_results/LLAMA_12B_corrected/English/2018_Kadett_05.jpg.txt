Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the behavior of holes on a fence as it falls. The scenario describes how the holes on one side of the fence are aligned in a specific pattern when the fence falls over. The pattern shows a series of circles and triangles (or squares) outlining a specific arrangement of shapes at various points along the fence. We know that the fence falls over and lies on the floor, meaning all the holes will be on one side of the fence now. Given this, we look for an option where the holes are arranged such that when the fence is lying down, they would maintain the same pattern as depicted in the diagram. The arrangement of holes in Option A keeps the same pattern when the fence is lying down. These options do not maintain the same pattern when the fence is lying down.

Answer: A)
