Reasoning: The question is asking for the missing piece in a jigsaw puzzle. The puzzle consists of 12 pieces arranged in four rows of three. Each piece has a star pattern. All rows except the first one have two identical pieces in each row. Example: Row 2 and Row 3 have two identical pieces each. Looking at Row 1, we can see that it only has one identical piece from Rows 2 and 3. Therefore, the missing piece must be one of the two remaining pieces that are not identical to the piece in Row 1. The missing piece must be one of the two remaining pieces that are not identical to the piece in Row 1. These are Options B and C. Therefore, the correct answer is either B or C.
Answer: No Answer.
