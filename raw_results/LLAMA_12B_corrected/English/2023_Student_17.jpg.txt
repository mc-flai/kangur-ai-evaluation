Reasoning: To solve question 17, we need to understand what a "closed path" on a cuboid means and then examine each option. The cuboid has six faces, each with different ways of drawing paths. A closed path means starting and ending at the same point. Looking at the options: A) It starts and ends at the same point. B) It starts at one point but ends at another, so it's not closed. C) It starts at one point but ends at another, so it's not closed. D) It starts at one point but ends at another, so it's not closed. E) It starts and ends at the same point, making it a closed path. The correct answer is (E). This is because only option E depicts a path that begins and ends at the same point, which is the definition of a closed path. Options A, B, C, and D do not meet this criteria.  
Answer: E)
