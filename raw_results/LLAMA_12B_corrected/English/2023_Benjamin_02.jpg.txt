Reasoning: To solve question 2, we need to determine which of the given matchstick arrangements can be formed using a specific configuration of matchsticks and a fixed number of matchsticks (7). The goal is to find the largest possible number that can be built using these matchsticks. The matchstick arrangements are provided in the image, with each arrangement consisting of 7 matchsticks. We need to examine each arrangement carefully and think about how we can use these matchsticks to form a meaningful number. After analyzing all the matchstick arrangements, we find that the largest possible number that can be built using 7 matchsticks is 800. This is achieved by arranging the matchsticks in a certain configuration, as shown in the image.
