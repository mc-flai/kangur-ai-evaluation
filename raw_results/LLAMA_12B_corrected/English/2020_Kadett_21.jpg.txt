Reasoning: The question describes a swimming pool with four corners, each 10 meters by 25 meters. There is a child in one corner of the pool, and a swimming instructor is sitting in the middle of one of the edges of the pool. The pool has a total area of $10 \times 25 = 250$ square meters. The possible distances covered by the children are $90m, 120m, 140m, 160m$, and $210m$. The surface area of the pool is $4 \times 10 \times 25 = 1000$ square meters. Since the children can choose any path along the edges of the pool to reach the instructor, the sum of the distances covered by the children must be equal to the perimeter of the pool. The perimeter of the pool is $4 \times 10 + 4 \times 25 = 160m$. Since there are four children, the sum of the distances covered by them is $160m$. Among the given options, only $A) 90m, B) 120m, C) 140m, D) 160m$ and E) $210m$, the sum that matches the perimeter of the pool is option $A) 90m, B) 120m, C) 140m, D) 160m$.

Answer: D)
