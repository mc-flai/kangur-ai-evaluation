Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to find the surface area of a cube and then calculate the maximum number of white sides that can be included on the surface of the large cube while still having as much white as possible. The formula for the surface area of a cube is $S = 6s^2$, where $s$ is the length of one side of the cube. If Linus arranges the cubes so that each of the large cube's 6 faces has as much white as possible, all 4 faces of each small cube will be white on the outside of the larger cube. Therefore, the total number of white sides is $6 \times 4 = 24$. However, since there are 32 blocks of 4, each with 4 white sides, there are $32 \times 4 = 128$ white sides in total. The number of faces of the large cube that can be white without using more than 24 blocks to make up the outside of the cube will be when Linus creates 4 faces of white side facing outside and 2 faces of gray side inside. In other words, as soon as he uses up all the available white blocks, x * face (white), then the cube with the maximum white has x of its sides as white because there are 4 sides to each cube inside the big cube. Using this last point as both part of equation 2 and part of equation 4, we find that the maximum white part of a side will be found using the multiplied out equation: $4s + 4s + 32s + 32s = 24$, solving for $s$ and then squaring it to get the final surface area solution, we find $\frac{2048}{8}=\frac{3}{4},\ máº¡ng\sqrt{\frac{3}{4}}.= \boxed{\) $\frac{3}{4}$ (C)}
