Reasoning: To determine which kangaroos can be wearing a hat today, we need to analyze the given statements and find any valid conclusions. **Alex does not wear a hat**: This statement tells us that Alex is definitely not wearing a hat. **Bob wears a hat**: This directly states that Bob is wearing a hat. **Carl does not wear a hat**: Similar to the first statement, this tells us that Carl is not wearing a hat. From the above points: **Only Alex (A)** cannot wear a hat because it contradicts the statement "Alex does not wear a hat". **Only Alex (B)** is not correct as per the information provided. **Alex, Bob, and Carl (C)** is incorrect because if Bob wears a hat and Carl does not, then it cannot include all three. **Neither Alex nor Bob (D)** is not possible because Bob wears a hat, which means that at least one of them is wearing a hat. **Only Bob (E)** is correct because it is consistent with all given statements; Bob wears a hat, while Alex and Carl do not. **Final Answer: The final answer is (E). I hope it is correct.**
