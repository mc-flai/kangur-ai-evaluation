Reasoning: **Step 1: Understand the problem**

The question asks which picture size (width in cm $\times$ height in cm) has its lower edge nearest to the floor when hung on a wall with nails 2.5m above the floor.

**Step 2: Analyze the distances**

Let's analyze the distances of the lower edges of each picture from the floor:

*   Picture A: $2.5m - 40cm = 2.46m$ ($-40cm$ is the width of the picture itself)
*   Picture B: $2.5m - 50cm = 2.45m$ ($-50cm$ is the width of the picture itself)
*   Picture C: $2.5m - 90cm = 2.41m$ ($-90cm$ is the width of the picture itself)
*   Picture D: $2.5m - 60cm = 2.44m$ ($-60cm$ is the width of the picture itself)
*   Picture E: $2.5m - 100cm = 2.40m$ ($-100cm$ is the width of the picture itself)

**Step 3: Compare the distances**

Comparing the calculated distances to the floor for each picture size:

*   Picture A: $2.46m$ (farthest)
*   Picture B: $2.45m$ (farthest except for C, D, E)
*   Picture C: $2.41m$ (farthest)
*   Picture D: $2.44m$ (farthest except for B, E)
*   Picture E: $2.40m$ (closest)

**Step 4: Choose the correct answer**

Based on the comparison of distances, the lower edge of picture E ($160 \times 100$ cm) is the nearest to the floor.

Answer: E) $160\times100$ cm
