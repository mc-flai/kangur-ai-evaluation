Reasoning: To find the area of the hexagon, we can use the fact that it is composed of 6 congruent rhombuses. The area of each rhombus is given as 5 cm². Since the rhombuses are congruent, we can calculate the total area of all 6 rhombuses by multiplying the area of one rhombus by 6. 

**Total Area of Rhombuses = 6 * Area of One Rhombus** 
= 6 * 5 cm² 
= 30 cm² 

Since the hexagon is composed of these 6 rhombuses, the total area of the hexagon is equal to the total area of the rhombuses. 

**Area of the Hexagon = Total Area of Rhombuses** 
= 30 cm² 

Therefore, the correct answer is: 

**(A) 36 cm²** 
Answer: A)
