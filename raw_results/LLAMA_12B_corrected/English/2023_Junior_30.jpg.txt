Reasoning: To determine the perimeter of the entire park, we must sum all the section lengths. Each section comprises a subset of concave and convex curved edges surrounding the park. The common base for all sections is one straight line between park entry and exit. To accurately calculate the perimeter, we need to show all edges of the map which count towards the perimeter. To compute each section's length, we will calculate it in 3 steps: 1. For convex sections: use $$P = \sqrt{r^2+yr^2}$$ to find each section length. 2. For concave sections: calculate $P = 2\cdot \frac{2r}{\sin \phi}$ where $\phi$ is the angle between 2 points of structure part $r$. To solve the entire perimeter we need to sum the sections' perimeters. $$(P_{section 1}) + (P_{section2}) + (P_{section3}) = (P_{section4})$$
