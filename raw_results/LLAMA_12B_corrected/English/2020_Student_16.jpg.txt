Reasoning: The given sequence is defined by $f_{n} = n$ for $n \geq 1$. For $n \geq 2$, the rule $f_{n} = f_{n - 1} * f_{n + 1}$ applies. Let's generate the sequence: $f_{1} = 1$, $f_{2} = 2$, $f_{3} = f_{2} * f_{4} = 2 * f_{4}$, $f_{4} = f_{3} * f_{5} = 2 * f_{3} * f_{5}$, $f_{5} = f_{4} * f_{6} = (2 * f_{3} * f_{5}) * f_{6}$. To maintain the sequence, $f_{3} = f_{2} * f_{4}$. But as per the rule, $f_{n} = f_{n-1} * f_{n+1}$ for $f_{4}$ onwards, it will only consider the previous two values. By this rule, each new value depends on the previous two values. When $n$ is even, the product of these two consecutive members in the subsequence generated by $f_{2n}$ is the same as the number two raised to the power of $(n-2)$. That is, $f_{2n} = 2^{n-2}$. Based on $f_{2n}$ pattern: $f_{2}, f_{4}, f_{6，那} ..., f_{4008}$ will be available. And since natural numbers are being generated, no value will be repeated or missing. Since only the first 2019 natural numbers are needed, the 2001st natural number is $1001*2$. Which yields an exponent of $1001$. The MSB of $1001$ is the first '1', so the total number of wanted ones is $1001 - 1 + 1= 1001$. This can be represented a senseless sequence in the bits as WELL務HAVEVEGGVESGVEGC []
