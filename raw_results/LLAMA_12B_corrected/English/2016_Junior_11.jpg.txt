Reasoning: **Step 1: Analyze the given equations and understand their implications.**

The equations provided are:

1. a + 5 = b^2 - 1
2. c^2 + 3 = d - 4

These equations relate the real numbers a, b, c, and d. The first equation suggests a relationship between a and b, while the second equation relates c and d.

**Step 2: Consider the properties of real numbers, specifically any patterns or restrictions that could help determine the relationship between the variables.**

Real numbers include all rational and irrational numbers. There are no direct mathematical relationships between these equations that immediately reveal the largest number without further information.

**Step 3: Examine the options provided to see if any directly relate to known properties or categories of real numbers that could help identify the largest value.**

The options are:
(A) a
(B) b
(C) c
(D) d
(E) It cannot be uniquely determined using this information.

**Step 4: Evaluate the choice based on the provided information and common mathematical principles about the nature of real numbers.**

Without explicit numerical values or further context (like function relationships between a, b, c, and d), it's challenging to determine which number is explicitly the biggest from the equations alone. Typically, in such questions, the setup might involve a simplification or a specific relationship that isn't immediately obvious without more information.

**Step 5: Provide a final analysis considering the direct implications of the equations and the standard mathematical understanding of real numbers.**

Given the lack of specific details or numerical relationships that necessarily point to one variable being larger than the others, the correct answer regarding which of the numbers a, b, c, or d is the biggest cannot be definitively determined based solely on the provided information.

Answer: E)
