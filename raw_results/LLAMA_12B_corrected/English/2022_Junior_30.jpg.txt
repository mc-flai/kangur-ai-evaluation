Reasoning: To determine the diameter of the holes, we need to consider the dimensions of the wooden cube and how the hemispheres are carved into its faces. The cube has sides of length 2, and each face is equally sized. 

**Step 1: Calculate the Volume of a Hemisphere**

The volume of a hemisphere (half of a sphere) with radius r is given by:

V = (2/3)πr^3

Since we are dealing with the intersection of a hemisphere and a cube, the radius of each hemisphere is half the length of a side of the cube, which is 1.

Substituting r = 1 into the formula:

V = (2/3)π(1)^3  
V = (2/3)π

**Step 2: Calculate the Surface Area of the Hemisphere**

The surface area of a hemisphere with radius r is given by:

A = 3πr^2

Substituting r = 1 into the formula:

A = 3π(1)^2  
A = 3π

**Step 3: Determine the Diameter of the Holes**

Given that all holes are equally sized and their midpoints are in the center of the faces of the cube, the diameter of each hole will be equal to the diameter of the circle formed by the intersection of the hemisphere and the face of the cube.

Since the radius of the hemisphere (and thus the radius of the circle) is 1, the diameter of the circle (and hence the diameter of the hole) is 2.

Therefore, the diameter of the holes is 2.

**Conclusion**

The correct answer is A).
