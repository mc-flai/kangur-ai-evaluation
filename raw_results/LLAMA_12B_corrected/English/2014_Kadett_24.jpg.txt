Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the scoring system for each question and how many questions each person gets correct. For each correctly solved question, Jan gets 4 points. For each correctly solved question, Eva gets 1 point. The total points they scored together is 312. Jan solved 60 questions. Eva solved 60 questions. Let's denote the number of questions Jan gets correct as \(J\) and the number of questions Eva gets correct as \(E\). We know that for every question Jan solves, Eva gets 1 point for each of their correctly solved questions. Given: Jan's points = 4\(J\) and Eva's points = \(E\). The total points they score together is 312, so we have: \(4J + E = 312\). Additionally, we know: Jan solved 60 questions: \(J = 60\) and Eva solved 60 questions: \(E = 60\). Substituting these values into our equation: \(4(60) + 60 = 312\) gives us \(240 + 60 = 312\), which leads to \(300 \neq 312\). This indicates our initial approach might be incorrect as we did not solve for a missing value directly; instead, we were verifying if their points match the total given. Let's reassess based on the correct approach for solving each part of the question. For every question Jan solves, he gets 4 points, and for every question Eva solves, she gets 1 point. They together scored 312 points. If Jan solves 4 times the number of questions Eva solves covered by points (not considering the overlap), then **60/4 means 15 questions covered by the points difference**, but we are trying to equate the points. We already know Jan solved 60 questions correctly. Eva solved 60 questions. Given Eva's advantage: If she solves x questions, Jan solves them 4 times faster. But they need to share 312 points. Equation from line 1: \(312 = 4J + 60\). To find the difference in problem counting between Jan and Eva for their reaching sums 312: \(312 = E\).

Answer: No Answer.
