Reasoning: The question asks us to determine how many edges a 23-triangular faces pyramid has. A triangular face has 3 edges. If we're given the number of triangular faces (23), we can calculate the total number of edges by multiplying the number of triangular faces by 3 and then dividing by 2, since each edge is counted twice. Total edges = (Number of triangular faces * 3) / 2. Total edges = (23 * 3) / 2. Total edges = 69. The correct answer is option E) 69.  
Answer: E)
