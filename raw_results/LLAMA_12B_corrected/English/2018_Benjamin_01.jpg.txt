Reasoning: To determine which option is correct, we need to consider the number of balloons that will be hit by a dart. According to the diagram, three darts are thrown at nine fixed balloons. Option A suggests that only two balloons will be hit, which seems unlikely given the diagram. Option B mentions three balloons being hit, but there are only three darts. Option C states that four balloons will be hit, which also seems unlikely. Option D indicates that five balloons will be hit, while option E suggests that six balloons will be hit. To solve this problem, we can use the principle of indistinguishability. Since all the darts are identical and the balloons are also identical, it doesn't matter which dart hits which balloon as long as the total number of hits is the same. In this scenario, since there are three darts and nine balloons, we can divide the total number of balloons (9) by the number of darts (3) to get an approximate average of 3 balloons per dart. This means that on average, 3 balloons will be hit by each dart. However, not all balloons will be hit, as there will be some that are missed. A possible configuration could be: dart 1 hits balloon 1, dart 2 hits balloon 8, and dart 3 hits balloon 9. This configuration gives us 3 hits, but not all balloons are hit. Another possible configuration could be: dart 1 hits balloon 1 and 5 (2 hits), dart 2 hits balloon 8 (1 hit), and dart 3 hits balloon 9 (1 hit). This also gives us 4 hits, but again, not all balloons are hit. Based on these considerations, the correct answer is option E), as it is the only option that correctly states that six balloons will be hit by the three darts.

Answer: E)
