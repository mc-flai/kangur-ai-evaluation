Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the problem and how many ways Maia can color three white houses with the same color so that Maia can walk from A to B. The problem is about coloring three white houses with the same color. We are not given any information about the type of coloring or the restrictions on colors. Therefore, we can assume that Maia can use any color she wants. There are two ways to approach this problem: 1. **Counting:** Let's count the number of ways to color the three houses with the same color. We can start by choosing the color for the first house. There are 24 possible colors (since there are 24 bees). Once we have chosen the color for the first house, the colors for the second and third houses must match this color. This means that there is only one way to color the second and third houses after choosing the color for the first house. Therefore, the total number of ways to color the three houses with the same color is equal to the number of possible colors for the first house, which is 24. However, since we are asked to find the number of ways to color the houses without any restriction on colors, this means that all the colors are allowed. In that case, the arrangement should consist of 4 units (4 distinct colors) that go from house A to house B. 2. **Pattern:** Let's analyze the pattern of coloring the houses. Since there are four houses and there should be only 3 colors, each color will appear twice. One way to achieve this pattern is by using a repeating pattern like ABAA. Now, let's count the number of ways to color the first house with any of the 24 colors. The second house must be the same color as the first house, so there is only one way to color it. The third house must be a different color from both the first and second houses' colors, so there is only one way to color it. The final house must be the same color as the first house, so there is only one way to color it. Therefore, the total number of ways to color the three houses with the same color is 1.
