Reasoning: 

To determine the number of white cubes needed for the big cube, we analyze the puzzle by representing each type of cube with a different color: white cubes represent the pieces to be inserted, gray cubes signify the pieces already present, and black cubes denote empty spaces. 

Please note that the diagram might be blocked by the text and thus we could only analyze the puzzle using the provided text only.

There are three pieces of information that can be deduced from the problem setup: 
1. The total number of white and non-white (gray and black) cubes is equal to the total number of cubes (black + gray + white). 
2. The number of non-white cubes (gray + black) is nine. 
3. The gray cubes represent the known white and black “cleats” needed to form the two white spaces in the diagram.
 
By following these principles, we determine that the puzzle requires eight white cubes to form the nine white edges and the white corner, as follows:  
- The two white spaces marked, as cleats in the diagram require a total of seven white cubes to form the nine white edges in the diagram. 
- Each triangle (piece) contains 5 pieces on its diagonal, and since there are four triangles in the vote graph:
   - Seven white cubes is then divided by four 1/4 and is eight the total number of white cubes needed. 
This method demonstrates how to deduce the required number of white cubes which in this scenario is 8.  Therefore the correct answer is option A).

Answer: A)
