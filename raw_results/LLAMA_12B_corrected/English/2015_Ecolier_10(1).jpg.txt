Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between the small cubes and the larger cube made by folding the paper net. The correct answer should reflect the number of small cubes that are either grey or white on the corresponding face of the large cube. The question asks about the face that has a number 3 opposite to it. This means we are looking for a face on the large cube that is colored such that its opposite face has the number 3 on it. In a 3x3x3 cube, each face of one color is opposite a face of the other color. If we have a face with a number 3, its opposite face will have a different color (grey or white). Given the information from the diagram, we can determine the correct answer: Because 2 is on the face that is opposite to the face with the number 3,
