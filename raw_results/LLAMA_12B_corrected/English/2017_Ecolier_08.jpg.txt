Reasoning: To answer this question, we need to use the concept of strategy for figure-ground perception. The stimulus is an ambiguous perceptual task that asks us to identify which picture shows Anna's house from the back. The correct answer will be the one that has three windows and no door. This is a key feature that distinguishes it from the other options. **Step 1: Identify the key features** * Three windows * No door **Step 2: Eliminate options with less than three windows or a door** * Option A and B both have only two windows and a door, so they can be eliminated. * Option C has more than three windows, so it can also be eliminated. * Option D has a door, so it can be eliminated as well. **Step 3: Select the remaining option** * Only option E remains, which has three windows and no door. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: E)
