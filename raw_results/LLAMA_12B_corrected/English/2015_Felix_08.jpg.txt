Reasoning: 

To solve this question, we need to find the numbers that are outside the square root of each number in the box.

We start by finding the square root of each number in the box.

*   The square root of 9 is √9 = 3
*   The square root of 24 is √24 ≈ 4.9
*   The square root of 36 is √36 = 6

Next, we compare the numbers from the outside circle with the square roots we calculated.

*   52 is not less than or equal to any of the square roots (3, 4.9, or 6), so it is outside the square.
*   48 is not less than or equal to any of the square roots (3, 4.9, or 6), so it is outside the square.
*   6 is less than or equal to 6, so it is inside the square.
*   5 is not less than or equal to any of the square roots (3, 4.9, or 6), so it is outside the square.
*   4 is not less than or equal to any of the square roots (3, 4.9, or 6), so it is outside the square.
*   3 is not less than or equal to any of the square roots (3, 4.9, or 6), so it is outside the square.
