Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of mod 7 arithmetic. In mod 7 arithmetic, when a number is divided by 7, the remainder is called the residue or the number modulo 7. The problem states that Bart wrote the number 1015 as a sum of numbers that are made up of only the digit 7. We can calculate this as follows: 1015 = 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 35. Now, we want to find the smallest number of 7's that will give a sum equal to 2023 modulo 7. First, let's calculate 2023 modulo 7: 2023 mod 7 = 2023 - (2023 // 7) * 7 = 2023 - 288 * 7 = 2023 - 2016 = 7. So, 2023 is equivalent to 7 modulo 7. This means that the smallest number of 7's that will give a sum equal to 2023 modulo 7 is just one 7. Therefore, the correct answer is option (A) 2.
