Reasoning: To determine which of the functions best describes the thickness of the unrolled part of the roll as a function of the constant speed, we must consider how the thickness changes as you roll out the paper. A) The linear equation would imply that the thickness remains constant as you roll out the paper regardless of the speed. However, when rolling out the paper, its thickness tends to decrease as more paper is unrolled because there is less tension on the remaining paper. B) The exponentially decreasing equation matches the real-world scenario where the thickness of the remaining paper decreases as more paper is unrolled, due to the decrease in tension from the remaining paper. C) The sinusoidal function does not accurately represent the relationship between the thickness and the roll's position, as the decrease in thickness is not cyclical but follows an exponential pattern. D) The polynomial function can be too complex and does not capture the simplicity and consistency in the decrease of thickness as the roll is unrolled. E) The logarithmic function does not accurately represent the decrease in thickness as the roll is unrolled, as the decrease should be more drastic, especially when starting from a thicker section towards a thinner one. Given these considerations, the exponentially decreasing function is the best description of how the thickness of the unrolled part of the paper decreases in a constant-speed scenario.
