Reasoning: The image presents a question with five answer options, where the primary goal is to identify the number concealed beneath one of five black cards. Four colored cards are visible, each adorned with a distinct number. To determine the concealed number, we must understand the pattern governing the numbers' placement. Each child has a colored card featuring one of the numbers 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14, with a particular number hidden beneath a black card. The addition rule inherent in this puzzle is as follows: Each cell in the grid contains the sum of the numbers on two adjacent cards. If the sum of the two numbers on the adjacent cards exceeds 32, the black card is added to achieve a total of 34. If the sum of the adjacent card numbers is 32, the number on the black card is directly revealed as 32. When the sum of the two adjacent numbers is 26, the digit on the black card is 14. According to the provided information, let us calculate the sum of the numbers on each pair of cards: **Option A:** The pair is (6, 8) sum = 14; there are no pairs that sum to 26 **Option D:** the pair is (12, 14) sum = 26; hence, we confirm that the black card has the number 14.

Answer: D)
