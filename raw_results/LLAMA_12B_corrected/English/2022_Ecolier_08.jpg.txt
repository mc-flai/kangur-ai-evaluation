Reasoning: To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of '4-point' and its relation with the geometric figures displayed in the image. In the image, there is a set of five different diagrams (A-E). Each diagram has a set of lines forming rectangles or squares. Outside the lines, there is one diagonal line connecting two opposite corners. *   **Option A** has two rectangles. One inside the other and the diagonal line connecting the top-left and bottom-right vertices. *   **Option B** has two rectangles which are mutually exclusive. A square lies inside both rectangles, and the diagonal line forms the top-left and bottom-right vertices of the outer rectangle. *   **Option C** has one square placed inside another square. The square has a diagonal line passing through the most points and connecting the top-left and bottom-right vertices. *   **Option D** has a single square enclosed by a square. The diagonal line passes through the points of an inner square, which has the most points when it is enclosed by another square. *   **Option E** is incomplete and irrelevant here. It can be seen that all five images can be labeled as 4 - point Examples. Hence the answer for question number 8 is **A, B, C,&D**)
