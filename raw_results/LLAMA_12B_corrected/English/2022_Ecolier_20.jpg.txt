Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of regular hexagons and their symmetry. A 6-house square grid has a dual polygon, which is a star polygon with six inward pointing arms. These arms form the paths of one set of paths matching one side of the 6 x 6 square grid. They then reduce to 3, 2, or 1 set of parallel paths. The dual polygon and one set of the length-based paths can be used to route a vehicle, divided into vehicles, from each of the 6 houses. A hexagon's dual polygon is a 3-pointed star with the 3 legs going along the hexagon's edges from vertex to vertex. With this star structure as a route path, we need to set up each house path to leave in the hexagon's angle that is farthest from the common point at the base of our star. If there is a direct path not covered by the star, two regions must be connected via the common edge path. Red or blue dotted paths are used to make use of those paths. We use two plaid bands for regions far from each edge. JRSpressle, ILCanpchange left and right; unchanged LV3atcaputa restores left and right. The circling arms reverse direction. Left H A I L moving clockwise. Right M N K moving clockwise. H is connected to BK and LE on the top left. N is connected to HI on the bottom right. K is connected to top left LE. The one correct sheet with these arm configurations. AL shows E very high.uid.
