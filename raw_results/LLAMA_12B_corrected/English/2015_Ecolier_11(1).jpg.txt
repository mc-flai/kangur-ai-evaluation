Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many small white cubes Jack has used to make a cube. From the given diagram, we can observe that there are 2 options for placing a colored cube: either on the left side or on the right side. Based on this information, we can establish the following relationships: $4 \times 3 = 12$ and $3 \times 3 = 9$. Option A can be eliminated as it is larger than the other options. We also eliminate option D because there are not enough small cubes in the diagram to match its value. The remaining options are A), B), C), and E). We can start by eliminating option C) because it gives too few small white cubes. We see that B), C), and D) are incorrect. Option A) can be eliminated because of the triangle. There is one side and three points, so we can have three small white cubes helping out where one side cube will have an opposite color. All of the small cubes and the large cube are on the same side (top) so we know the two smallest sides meet at an intermediary, therefore any other choice is incorrect. Therefore, we conclude that the answer is A), B), C), or E). The final answer is E).

Answer: E)
