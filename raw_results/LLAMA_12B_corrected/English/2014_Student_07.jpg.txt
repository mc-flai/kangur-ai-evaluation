Reasoning: **Step 1: Understand the problem**

The question asks to find the number of digits in the result of the expression (2^22)^5 × (5^55)^2.

**Step 2: Calculate each part separately**

First, let's calculate (2^22)^5:

(2^22)^5 = 2^(22*5) = 2^110

Next, let's calculate (5^55)^2:

(5^55)^2 = 5^(55*2) = 5^110

**Step 3: Multiply the results**

Now, we need to multiply these two results:

2^110 × 5^110 = 10^110

**Step 4: Determine the number of digits**

Since 10^x always has x+1 digits, the number of digits in 10^110 is 110+1 = 111.

**Final Answer**: The correct answer is E).

Answer: E)
