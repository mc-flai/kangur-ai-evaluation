Reasoning: The question asks about the age difference between Paul and Josef when they are 12 years old, and how old they will both be together in four years time. Since both Paul and Josef are already 12 years old, there is no age difference between them currently. In four years, Paul will be 12 + 4 = 16 years old, and Josef will be 12 + 4 = 16 years old as well. Their combined age in four years will be 16 + 16 = 32 years. Based on the given information, answer D) 19 is incorrect because it does not match the calculated result. The correct answer is E) 20, but since E) 20 is not an option given in the question, the closest answer would be D) 19, assuming they are referring to their combined age at a different timepoint.  
Answer: D)
