Reasoning: To find the length of the diagonal of the parallelogram shown in the image, we can apply the concept of congruent triangles. The central lawn is a square divided into three lawns of equal area, where the central lawn is a parallelogram. Each lawn is congruent, and the central lawn can be divided into two congruent triangles, along the diagonal. Each triangle shares an angle with the smaller diagonal of the square and another angle with one side. So, these triangles are congruent to the small part of the square. Given that the smaller diagonal of the square is two sides of the square and equals 8 meters, we have two triangles sharing this side. The square has area 12 square meters, meaning the side length of the square is sqrt{12*12/2}=6.9284\ m. The base of each of the two congruent triangles is a side of the square, whereas the height is the difference between the side length of the square and the hypotenuse of the small triangle formed. The correct configuration of a square divided into three congruent smaller triangles is the key to this concept.
