Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of geometric shapes and their relationships. We have a map with trees planted along paths in a park. There are 5 trees and 3 paths on the map. Another tree is planted so that there is an equal number of trees on both sides of each path. Determine in which section of the park the new tree will be planted. There are 5 trees. There are 3 paths. The new tree will have an equal number of trees on both sides of each path. Let's label the sections A, B, C, D, and E as shown in the diagram. Currently, there are 3 trees on one side of each path and 2 trees on the other side of each path, except for one path where 4 trees are on one side and 1 tree is on the other. To achieve an equal number of trees on both sides of each path, we need to add a tree so that all paths have the same number of trees on each side. If we add the new tree to Section B, it would have 3 trees on both sides of Path 1 and 2 trees on both sides of Path 2 and Path 3. If we add the new tree to Section C, it would have an unbalanced distribution of trees on Path 2 and Path 3 because one side would have 3 trees and the other side would have 2 trees. If we add the new tree to Section D, it would have an unbalanced distribution of trees on Path 2 and probably Path 3 depending on the layout. If we add the new tree to Section E, it would create an issue with Path 3, where one side would have 3 trees and the other side would have only 2 trees due to Path 3's initial configuration. If we add the new tree to Section E, it seems to offer no significant advantage over other options as it does not directly contribute to achieving the desired balanced distribution across all paths.
