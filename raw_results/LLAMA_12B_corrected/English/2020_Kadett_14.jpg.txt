**Reasoning:**

To solve this problem, let's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion which states that for any finite sets $A$ and $B$, the size of their union is the sum of their sizes minus the size of their intersection.

Let $A$ be the set of students who swim and $B$ be the set of students who dance.

We are given that:

*   The total number of students in the class is 48.
*   32 students do both swimming and dancing.
*   Three eighths of the students swim.
*   There are exactly five students who do both.

First, we can find the number of students who swim by multiplying the total number of students by three-eighths:

$$\frac{3}{8} \times 48 = 18$$

Since 32 students do both swimming and dancing, we can set up an equation using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:

$$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$$

We know that $|A \cap B| = 32$, so:

$$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - 32$$

We also know that $|A|=18$. We need to find $|B|$.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 48, so:

$$|A \cup B| = 48$$

Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

$$48 = 18 + |B| - 32$$

Solving for $|B|$, we get:

$$|B| = 56$$

Therefore, there are 56 students who dance.

Now, we can find the number of students who only swim or only dance by subtracting the number of students who do both from the total number of students:

$$\text{|only swim or only dance|} = 48 - 32 - 5 = 11$$

So, there are 11 students who only swim or only dance.

**Answer:** E) 11
