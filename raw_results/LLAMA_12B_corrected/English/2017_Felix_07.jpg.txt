Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the movement of Alfred's building block. The building block can only move to the right or up. Option A shows the block moving only to the right. However, the final position does not match the given options. Option B shows the block moving mainly to the right but also has some upward movement. This is the correct interpretation of the movement pattern. Option C shows the block moving only upwards. However, the final position does not match the given options. Option D shows the block moving mainly to the right but also has some downward movement. This is incorrect because the block cannot move downwards. Option E shows the block moving mainly to the left. However, the final position does not match the given options. Therefore, the correct answer is **Option B** because it correctly represents the movement pattern of the building block.
Answer: B)
