Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between the number of triangles and the number of stars formed by a star pattern. Each star pattern consists of three triangles and each triangle can be used multiple times to form other star patterns. 

**Step 1: Calculate the number of triangles from the star patterns**

For 3 stars, the number of triangles = 3 * 3 = 9 triangles

For 4 stars, the number of triangles = 4 * 3 = 12 triangles

For 5 stars, the number of triangles = 5 * 3 = 15 triangles

For 6 stars, the number of triangles = 6 * 3 = 18 triangles

**Step 2: Find the minimum number of triangles used**

From the calculations above, the minimum number of triangles used is 9, which corresponds to the option C) 4 stars.

Therefore, the correct answer is C) 4.

Answer: C)
