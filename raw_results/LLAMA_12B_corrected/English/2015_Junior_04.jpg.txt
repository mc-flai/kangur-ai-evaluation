Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more biscuits Anna should have got if they shared them in proportion with the amount they had each paid. Let's first find out how many biscuits each of them got initially: - Anna got 10 biscuits. - Beate got x biscuits. - Cindy got 10 - (x + 10) = 10 - x biscuits. They paid 80 cents, 50 cents, and 20 cents, respectively. So, the total amount they paid is 80 + 50 + 20 = 150 cents. To find out how many more biscuits Anna should have got, we need to calculate the proportion of the amount she paid to the total amount and multiply it by the total number of biscuits. Proportion of Anna's payment to the total payment = 80 / 150 = 4/15. Total number of biscuits = 30. Number of biscuits Anna should have got = (Total number of biscuits) * (Proportion of Anna's payment to the total payment) = 30 * (4/15) = 8. Therefore, Anna should have got 8 more biscuits. The thought process was to calculate the proportion of the amount Anna paid to the total amount using fractions. Then, multiply this proportion by the total number of biscuits to determine how many more biscuits she should have got.

Answer: C) 8.
