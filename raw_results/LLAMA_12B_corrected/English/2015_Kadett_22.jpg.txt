Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to find the number that, when added to each pair of Peter's six cards and divided by two, will yield a sum of 82. We can start by trying each option. (Option A) $35+42+48+53+70\div2=82$. If Peter had a card with a number greater than 82, the sum would be too high, so we eliminate option A. (Option B) $42+70\div2=56$. However, this option already has 56, and we are looking for a total of 82, so we eliminate option B. (Option C) $48+53\div2=60$. As before, this option already has 60, and we are looking for a total of 82, so we eliminate option C. (Option D) $53+70\div2=78$. Since this option already has 78, we eliminate it as well. (Option E) $2\cdot 82=164\div2=82$. This option correctly yields 82 when paired with the other numbers, making it the correct answer. Our reasoning process involves trial and error, systematically checking each option to see if it meets the criterion. In this case, only option E fits the requirement.

Answer: E)
