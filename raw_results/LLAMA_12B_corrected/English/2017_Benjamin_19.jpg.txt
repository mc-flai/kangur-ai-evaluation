Reasoning: The image depicts a sequence of eight kangaroos arranged in rows, with the instruction to identify when a kangaroo swaps places with another. The kangaroos are arranged with the first and last kangaroos facing in opposite directions. Each kangaroo is separated by the same distance from its neighbor. Steps to determine the change in place include counting the number of kangaroos, comparing the sequence, identifying the pattern, and applying the pattern. Since there are 8 kangaroos, if each kangaroo swaps places in a sequence, the number of swaps will be 4 (half of 8). There are 7 different pairs in 8 numbers. The pairs from first to second, second to third, third to fourth, and fourth to first have their places swapped. The correct numbers that keep swapping places in a sequence are: 2, 10, 12, 13, and 16.
