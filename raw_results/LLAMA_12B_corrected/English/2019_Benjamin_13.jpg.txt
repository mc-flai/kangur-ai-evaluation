Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the sequence of animal changes and then determine the number of cats. The pattern is as follows:

- Dogs: 6
- Cats: 6
- Mice: 5

After changing 6 dogs into 6 cats, there is an equal number of dogs, cats, and mice. Now there are:

- Dogs: 5
- Cats: 11
- Mice: 5

Since the total number of dogs, cats, and mice should be equal after each change, we can see that after changing the dogs into cats, the number of cats becomes 11. Therefore, the correct answer is E) 11.

Answer: E)
