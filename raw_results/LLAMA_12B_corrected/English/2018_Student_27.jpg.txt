Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to find the real solutions to the equation |4^x - 3| = 1. The equation can be broken down into two separate equations: 1) 4^x - 3 = 1 2) 4^x - 3 = -1 **Solution 1:** 4^x - 3 = 1 Adding 3 to both sides gives us: 4^x = 4 Since the base is 4, we can rewrite the equation as: x = 2 **Solution 2:** 4^x - 3 = -1 Adding 3 to both sides gives us: 4^x = 2 Taking the logarithm base 4 of both sides gives us: x = log4(2) x = 0.5 Now, we have two possible values for x: 2 and 0.5.
