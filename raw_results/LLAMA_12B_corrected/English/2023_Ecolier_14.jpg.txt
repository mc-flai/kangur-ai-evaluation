Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the pattern of numbers and the sequence of animals. 1. **Identifying the Pattern**: The given numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 2. **Quadruplets and Quincuplets**: We notice that these numbers are part of a sequence where each number has a counterpart. For instance, 1 and 8 (quintuplequads), 2 and 7 (quadruplicatequints), 3 and 6 (triplicetriples), 4 and 5 (squaredquadruples). 3. **Arrangement of Animals**: In the options provided, we see that 3 animals are beavers and 2 kangaroos, arranged in a row. To maintain the pattern described, we can infer the positions of beavers and kangaroos based on the relationships observed. 4. **Determining Positions**: Given the pattern observed, the positions of beavers could be 1, 3, and 4. This aligns with the arrangement that does not violate the observed pattern. 5. **Final Answer**: Considering all observations and inferences, the correct arrangement should include beavers at number 3, 5, and 8, and kangaroos at numbers 1, 2, 4, 6, 7.
