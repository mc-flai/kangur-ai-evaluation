Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the rules of how the numbers are placed in the 3Ã—3 table. The first digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but they must be adjacent to each other. This means that when filling with 1, the number directly next to it must be either 2 or 3, and similarly for 2 and 3. There are no restrictions on the position of 4 relative to the other numbers.

Given these conditions, let's place the digits one by one:

- Starting with 1, the only possible arrangements for the first row are [1, 2, 3] or [1, 3, 2]. Since the question mentions "adjacent," and considering the comments suggest it might have been misunderstood, let's consider the possibilities for filling the rest of the table.

- Once 1 is placed, the number next to it can be any of the remaining three digits (2, 3, or 4) considering the adjacency rule and the fact that they cannot share sides. Thus, the second digit must also be part of the initial arrangement to follow the given rule correctly. Since 2 cannot be next to 1, 3 must be side by side with 1. Therefore, 2 cannot be the second number but can be either first or third.

- Now, with 2 being placed first or third, 3 is eliminated as it violates the rule, leaving 4 as the only possibility for the second or fourth position. This restricts 4's placement further since it doesn't have an adjacent number that meets the criteria once 1 and 3 are in place.

- After placing 4, only one spot remains for 2, which can only be filled if one of the first arrangements allows it to be on the side without breaking any rules, thus the last piece falls quietly into place without needing the extra complexity of rearrangements beyond what fills the table as specified.
