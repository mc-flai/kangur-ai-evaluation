Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to find the numbers that form the same property as 2020. The property states that the number formed by the two digits on the left is equal to the number formed by the two digits on the right. Let's analyze each option: (A) 49: The number formed by the two digits on the left (4) is not equal to the number formed by the two digits on the right (9). (B) 50: The number formed by the two digits on the left (5) is not equal to the number formed by the two digits on the right (0). (C) 81: The number formed by the two digits on the left (8) is not equal to the number formed by the two digits on the right (1). (D) 90: The number formed by the two digits on the left (9) is equal to the number formed by the two digits on the right (0). (E) 99: The number formed by the two digits on the left (9) is equal to the number formed by the two digits on the right (9). Based on our analysis, only options D and E have the desired property. However, since option D was already mentioned in the original problem, we can not count this one. The final answer is **(E)**  
Answer: E)
