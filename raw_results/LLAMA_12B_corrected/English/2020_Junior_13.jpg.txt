Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of perpendicular bisectors and the properties of similar triangles. The shortest path from Atown to Cetown is through Betown. This information helps us determine where the signs are located in relation to each other. Signposts are placed on the left side of the road from Cetown to Atown. These signs indicate distances that are equivalent to the segments of the road, which leads us to conclude that each signpost is at the midpoint of the segment it represents. By joining these midpoints, we would form a line that is parallel to the road and passing through Betown. This line will also be the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting Atown and Cetown. We are dealing with two right-angled triangles formed by dropping perpendiculars from the signs onto this line. These triangles are similar because they share a right angle, have parallel sides, and therefore are related by a constant ratio. The two known sides of one triangle are \(9 \text{ km}\) and \(1 \frac{6}{10}\) km, corresponding to the segments Cetown-Betown and Atown-Betown, respectively. The perpendicular from the \(9 \text{ km}\) sign is completely drawn within Cetown, so the distance it creates within Cetown is \(6\text{ km}\). Now, we draw the perpendicular from the \(1 \frac{6}{10}\text{ km}\) sign. This will give us a height within Atown, denoted as \(h\). Given that it is similar to the first triangle, we apply the similarity relationship to determine \(h\). The aspect ratio helpt: Known sides: Side AB: ATOWN-BETOWN = 1.6 km Side BC: CETOWN-BETOWN = 9 km Height (AB): \(H\)  = cm for small-h-above(BETOWN) Assumption: AB (ATOWN-BETOWN): \(1 \frac{6}{10}\) km Formula: Missing side length $XY$ is to be unlocked dependent upon a valid formula selection.
