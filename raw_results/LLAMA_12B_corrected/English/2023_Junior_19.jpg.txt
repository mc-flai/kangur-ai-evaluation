Reasoning: To find the shaded area in grey, we need to calculate the total area of the big square and subtract the area of the unshaded circles. The big square has an area of $30 \text{ cm} \times 30 \text{ cm} = 900 \text{ cm}^2$. There are three circles with radii 5 cm, 4 cm, and 3 cm. The area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius. The area of the circle with radius 5 cm is $A_1 = \pi (5)^2 = 25\pi \text{ cm}^2$. The area of the circle with radius 4 cm is $A_2 = \pi (4)^2 = 16\pi \text{ cm}^2$. The area of the circle with radius 3 cm is $A_3 = \pi (3)^2 = 9\pi \text{ cm}^2$. The total area of the circles is $A_{\text{circles}} = A_1 + A_2 + A_3 = 25\pi + 16\pi + 9\pi = 50\pi \text{ cm}^2$. The shaded area in grey is equal to the area of the big square minus the area of the unshaded circles. The unshaded circles are the two circles with radii 5 cm and 4 cm. The total area of these circles is $A_{\text{unshaded}} = A_1 + A_2 = 25\pi + 16\pi = 41\pi \text{ cm}^2$. Therefore, the shaded area in grey is $A_{\text{shaded}} = A_{\text{square}} - A_{\text{unshaded}} = 900 - 41\pi \text{ cm}^2$. Comparing this with the given options, we see that option (A) corresponds to our calculated answer: $500 + 25\pi$, which is equivalent to $900 - 41\pi$. Therefore, the correct answer is option (A).

Answer: A)
