Reasoning: To answer question 5, we need to understand the problem correctly. The question states that there are 12 bridges (see diagram) connected by 10 islands, and all bridges are open for traffic. We are asked to find the minimum number of bridges that need to be closed off so that the traffic between A and B comes to a halt. The key concept here is to identify which bridges must be closed to prevent any traffic from passing between A and B. Closing one bridge would not necessarily stop traffic between A and B, as there could still be other routes available. Therefore, we need to think about which bridges, if closed, would completely isolate A and B from each other. Looking at the diagram: *   Closing bridge A (or B) alone would not work since other routes could be used. *   Closing bridge C alone would also not work because it is part of the path from A to B. *   However, if we consider closing bridges A and C together, this could potentially block all paths between A and B.

Answer: B)
