Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of squares and how they can be folded into different shapes. A square has four right angles and four equal sides. In this case, the question asks us to consider what the foil looks like after it has been folded over twice. After the first fold, the square would be divided into two equal parts along a diagonal. After the second fold, these two parts would be further divided into two equal parts each along another diagonal, effectively creating a smaller square in the middle and two larger rectangles on the outside. Therefore, the correct answer is option C), which shows two rectangles and a smaller square.  
Answer: C)
