Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between the number of squares in each white square and the total sum of all numbers in the white squares. The provided diagram shows a rectangle made up of twelve squares. Some of these squares are colored in black. Diana draws a rectangle made up of twelve squares onto a piece of squared paper. She writes the number of adjacent black squares into every white square. The diagram shows an example of such a rectangle. In the given diagram, we can observe that each white square has a number written on it, which represents the number of adjacent black squares. By examining the numbers on each white square, we can notice a pattern: The first two squares (top left and top right) have a number 1 written on them. The next four squares (second row) have a number 2 written on them. The next four squares (third row) have a number 1 written on them. From the pattern observed in step 2, we can conclude that each white square has a number equal to the number of adjacent black squares. In other words, the number on each white square is equal to the sum of the numbers on the adjacent black squares. To calculate the sum of all numbers in the white squares, we need to sum up the numbers on each white square. Let's do this step by step: The first two squares (top left and top right) have a number 1 written on them, so their sum is 1 + 1 = 2. The next four squares (second row) have a number 2 written on them, which means there are 2 adjacent black squares for each of these four white squares. Therefore, the sum of these four squares is 4 * 2 = 8. The next four squares (third row) have a number 1 written on them, similar to the first two squares. Therefore, their sum is also 4 * 1 = 4. Now, let's add up the sums calculated in step 4: 2 + 8 + 4 = 14. Based on the analysis performed above.
