Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of different shapes and how they can be arranged on a trapezium with a single straight line.

The question states that a dark disc with two holes is placed on top of a dial of a watch as shown. The dark disc is now rotated so that the number 8 can be seen through one of the holes. We are asked to determine which of the following shapes cannot be cut into two trapeziums with a single straight line.

Let's analyze each option:

**(A) Triangle**: A triangle cannot be cut into two trapeziums with a single straight line because it does not have the necessary properties to form a trapezium.

**(B) Rectangle**: A rectangle can be cut into two trapeziums with a single straight line by drawing a diagonal from one corner to the opposite corner.

**(C) Trapezium**: A trapezium can be cut into two trapeziums with a single straight line by drawing a line connecting the two parallel sides.

**(D) Regular hexagon**: A regular hexagon can be cut into two trapeziums with a single straight line by drawing a diagonal from one vertex to the opposite vertex.

**(E) Square**: A square can be cut into two trapeziums with a single straight line by drawing a diagonal from one corner to the opposite corner.

Based on the analysis above, the correct answer is **A)** Triangle, as it cannot be cut into two trapeziums with a single straight line.

Answer: A)
