Reasoning: The question asks which date is incorrect for the third Thursday in March for an unspecified number of years. Note that Kangaroo Day is a fictional holiday. March is the third month of the year. Therefore, it can never contain a Thursday. There is no correct answer as per the given options. All options are wrong because it is impossible for March to contain a Thursday, due to it being a shorter month than a week. The question appears to have a mistake in its phrasing.  
Answer: No Answer.
