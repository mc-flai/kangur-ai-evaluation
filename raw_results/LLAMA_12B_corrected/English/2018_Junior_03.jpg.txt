Reasoning: To determine the length of the third side, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, we are given that one side has a length of 5 and another side has a length of 2. Since the length of the third side is an odd whole number, we can test each option to see if it satisfies the Pythagorean theorem. Let's calculate the length of the third side for each option: *   Option A: If the length of the third side is 3, then we have a right-angled triangle with sides 5, 3, and 2. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get: *   5^2 + 3^2 = 25 + 9 = 34 *   2^2 = 4 Therefore, 34 is not equal to 4 + c^2, where c is the length of the third side. So, this option does not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. *   Option B: If the length of the third side is 4, then we have a right-angled triangle with sides 5, 4, and 2. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get: *   5^2 + 4^2 = 25 + 16 = 41 *   2^2 = 4 Therefore, 41 is not equal to 4 + c^2, where c is the length of the third side. So, this option does not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. *   Option C: If the length of the third side is 5, then we have a right-angled triangle with sides 5, 5, and 2. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get: *   5^2 + 5^2 = 25 + 25 = 50 *   2^2 = 4 Therefore, 50 is not equal to 4 + c^2, where c is the length of the third side. So, this option does not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. *   Option D: If the length of the third side is 6, then we have a right-angled triangle with sides
