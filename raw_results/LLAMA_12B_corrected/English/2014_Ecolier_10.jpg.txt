Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the diagram and find the solid that matches the description in option (A)-(E). The question asks for the solid that is made out of 8 identical cubes when viewed from above. Let's examine each option: (A) - This option shows an L-shaped solid with four cubes stacked vertically and two cubes placed horizontally across the top and bottom of the vertical stack. (B) - This option depicts a T-shaped solid with three cubes arranged vertically on one side and one cube placed on top of them in a perpendicular direction. (C) - This option illustrates a T-shaped solid with three cubes arranged vertically on one side and one cube placed on top of them in a perpendicular direction, similar to option (B). (D) - This option shows a square-based pyramid solid made up of six cubes, with four cubes forming the base and two cubes placed at the top, one at each corner of the base. (E) - This option displays an L-shaped solid with four cubes stacked vertically and two cubes placed horizontally across the top and bottom of the vertical stack, similar to option (A). Now, let's determine which solid consists of 8 identical cubes: * Option (A) contains 5 cubes (4 vertical + 1 horizontal). * Option (B) contains 4 cubes (3 vertical + 1 top). * Option (C) is identical to option (B), so it also contains 4 cubes. * Option (D) contains 6 cubes (4 base + 2 top). * Option (E) is identical to option (A), so it also contains 5 cubes. Based on the analysis, none of the options match the description of being made out of 8 identical cubes. However, if we consider the possibility that the question might be asking for the solid with the most cubes (as there are no option with exactly 8 cubes), we would choose option (D): I analyzed each option to identify which solid is most likely to be made out of 8 identical cubes based on the number of cubes in each. While none of the options exactly match the question's description, option (D) has the most cubes.

Answer: D)
