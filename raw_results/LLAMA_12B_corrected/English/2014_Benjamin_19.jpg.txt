Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the structure of a 3x3x3 cube and how many little cubes are removed. The given cube consists of 27 small cubes. If you remove some of these cubes, you will be left with a smaller cube that has fewer than 27 small cubes. From the provided options, we can see that options (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) represent different numbers of small cubes. However, there is no information about which option corresponds to which type of removed cube. Without this information, it is not possible to determine the correct answer. Therefore, we cannot provide a specific answer from the given options. 

Answer: No Answer.
