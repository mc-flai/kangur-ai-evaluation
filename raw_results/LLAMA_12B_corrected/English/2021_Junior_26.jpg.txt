Reasoning: 

To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of squares of an integer. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer with itself, i.e., \(x^2\), where \(x\) is an integer.

However, the question asks us to identify which of the given numbers could be the square of an integer. To do this, we need to find the square root of each number and check if it's an integer.

Let's calculate the square roots:

**(A) 100:** The square root of 100 is 10, which is an integer.  
**(B) 144:** The square root of 144 is 12, which is an integer.  
**(C) 256:** The square root of 256 is 16, which is an integer.  
**(D) 900:** The square root of 900 is 30, which is an integer.  
**(E) 10000:** The square root of 10000 is 100, which is an integer.  

Answer: A), B), C), D), E)
