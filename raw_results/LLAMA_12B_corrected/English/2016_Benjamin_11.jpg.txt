Reasoning: To determine the frequency of Nadja working per week, we need to understand the work patterns of Mona, Asma, and Nadja. Mona works three times and Asma works four times per week. They both work precisely two days from Monday to Friday. The question asks for the frequency of Nadja working per week. In a standard week, there are seven days. If everyone works three days, there will be a total of three + three + three + three + three = fifteen working days in a week. However, the question states that they work two days, not three. Therefore, there are two + two + two + two + two = ten working days in a week. Since there are only ten working days, and since Mona and Asma both work two days per week, they must share two common days. This leaves eight days remaining. Nadja needs to take up the remaining eight days since the question states that they work in the same nursery. Since there are eight days left, and there are five days in the work week, Nadja will need to work two days per week. Since there are eight days remaining and eight divided by 4 equals two, we can conclude that Nadja works two days per week.
