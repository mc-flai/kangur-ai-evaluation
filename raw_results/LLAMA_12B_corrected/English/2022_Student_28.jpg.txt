**Reasoning:**

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of integers between two given ranges. We are given two ranges: $\sqrt{N^2 + N + 1}$ and $\sqrt{9N^2 + N + 1}$.

First, we need to simplify these expressions by completing the square:

$$\sqrt{N^2 + N + 1} = \sqrt{(N + \frac{1}{2})^2 - \frac{1}{4}}$$

$$\sqrt{9N^2 + N + 1} = \sqrt{(3N + \frac{1}{2})^2 - \frac{1}{4}}$$

Now, we can see that both expressions are in the form of $x^2 - y^2$, where $x = N + \frac{1}{2}$ and $y = \frac{1}{2}$.

Using difference of squares, we can rewrite the expressions as:

$$\sqrt{(N + \frac{1}{2})^2 - (\frac{1}{2})^2}$$

$$\sqrt{(3N + \frac{1}{2})^2 - (\frac{1}{2})^2}$$

Now, we can take the square root to get:

$$|N + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}|$$

$$|3N + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}|$$

Simplifying further, we get:

$$|N + 0|$$

$$|3N + 0|$$

This means that the number of integers between these two ranges is equal to the number of integers between $N$ and $3N$.

The number of integers between two numbers $a$ and $b$ (inclusive) is always $b - a$. Therefore, the number of integers between $N$ and $3N$ is $3N - N = 2N$.

So, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C)** 2N
