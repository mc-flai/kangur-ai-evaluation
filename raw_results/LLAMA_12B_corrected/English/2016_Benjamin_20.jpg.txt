Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the given information and use it to find the correct answer. Here's how we can approach it: The problem states that Luigi sets out his tables individually with 4 chairs each and then he is 6 chairs short. This means that he needs additional chairs to accommodate all his customers comfortably. Luigi always puts two tables together to create a bigger table with 6 chairs, then he has 4 chairs left over. This implies that he adds a total of 4 chairs when combining two tables together. We know that each table has 4 chairs, so if Luigi sets out his tables individually without adding any extra chairs, he would have a total of 4 x number of tables = total number of chairs. Since he is 6 chairs short initially, he needs additional chairs to accommodate all his customers. When he combines two tables together, he gets 6 chairs from the combined table, and 4 chairs left over. Let's try each option to see which one satisfies the conditions: * Option A: If there are 8 tables, then Luigi has 8 x 4 = 32 chairs initially. After combining two tables, he gets 6 chairs from the combined table and 4 chairs left over, totaling 10 chairs. This means he still needs more chairs, but he is only 6 chairs short initially, which is not enough to accommodate all his customers. * Option B: If there are 10 tables, then Luigi has 10 x 4 = 40 chairs initially. After combining two tables, he gets 6 chairs from the combined table and 4 chairs left over, totaling 10 chairs. However, he still needs to accommodate the additional 2 tables without extra chairs, making this estimate too low. * Option C: If there are 12 tables, then Luigi has 12 x 4 = 48 chairs initially. After combining two tables, he gets 6 chairs from the combined table and 4 chairs left over, totaling 10 chairs. Considering he needs 6 more chairs to make up for the shortage, this option also seems too low. * Option D: If there are 14 tables, then Luigi has 14 x 4 = 56 chairs initially. After combining two tables, he gets 6 chairs from the combined table and 4 chairs left.
