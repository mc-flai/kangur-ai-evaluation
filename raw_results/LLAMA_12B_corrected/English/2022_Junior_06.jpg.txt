Reasoning: To solve question 6, we need to understand what the text is asking. The question states "I am smaller than my half and bigger than my double. The sum of me and my square is 0." This gives us two equations:

*   Let's denote "me" as X. Then, my half is $\frac{X}{2}$, and my double is $2X$.
*   The equation for being smaller than my half is $X < \frac{X}{2}$.
*   The equation for being bigger than my double is $X > 2X$.

From these equations, we can see that X must be negative because for any positive value of X, the second inequality does not hold true. Therefore, we are looking for a negative number where:

    *   The sum of X and its square is 0: $X + X^2 = 0$

This equation can be rewritten as $X^2 + X = 0$. Factoring this quadratic equation gives us $X(X + 1) = 0$. This equation is satisfied when either $X = 0$ or $X = -1$.

Since we have determined that X is negative and must satisfy the condition $X^2 + X = 0$, the only valid option that fits this description among the provided choices is:

Answer: B) -1
