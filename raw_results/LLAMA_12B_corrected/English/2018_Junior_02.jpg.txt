Reasoning: To determine the longest chain that can be built using the given interlinked rings, we need to carefully analyze each option provided. This option presents a chain with a single ring. It meets the criteria of containing the thick light ring but lacks any additional elements suggested by the question. This option showcases a chain with two rings. It not only contains the thick light ring but also includes another element. However, considering further modifications could potentially yield a longer chain. This option illustrates a chain consisting of three rings. Again, it contains the thick light ring and includes two additional elements. Nevertheless, the possibility of extending this chain through further modifications remains. This option features a chain with four rings. Similar to previous options, it encompasses the thick light ring and has three extra elements. Still, the potential for expansion is evident. This option presents a chain comprising five rings. To this point, each option has consistently met the inclusion of the thick light ring and added at least one additional element. However, upon reaching this length, no discernible extensions emerge to sustain further growth. Upon examining both interlaced rings and each provided chain option, it becomes evident that *Option E* can ultimately be extended by one more ring, thereby permitting the formation of a longer chain while retaining the extensive light ring prominently throughout the modification. Consequently, the best answer to the question is **Option E**.
Answer: E)
