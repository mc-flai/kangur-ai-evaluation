Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of permutation and combination. The figure has six regions to color and three colors available: red, blue, and yellow. Each region can be colored in one of three colors. Therefore, the total number of ways to color the figure is found by multiplying the number of options for each region together: $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 729$. Since these choices are independent, we can consider each region one at a time. For each region, there are three different colors that can be used.

Answer: D) 729
