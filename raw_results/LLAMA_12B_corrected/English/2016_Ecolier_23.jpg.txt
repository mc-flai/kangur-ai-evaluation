Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the given conditions:

*   The stick is made up of 27 building blocks.
*   One part of the stick is twice as long as the other part.
*   We take one of the two pieces and split it up so that one piece is twice as long as the other.

Let's analyze the options:

**(A) 2**

If we split the 2-piece stick into two equal parts, we will have two sticks each 1 unit long. This does not satisfy the condition that one piece is twice as long as the other.

**(B) 4**

If we split the 4-piece stick into two parts, we can make one part 3 units long and the other part 1 unit long. This satisfies the condition since the 3-unit piece is twice as long as the 1-unit piece.

**(C) 6**

If we split the 6-piece stick into two parts, the only way to satisfy the condition is to have one part 5 units long and the other part 1 unit long. However, there is no way to split a 6-piece stick into two parts with a difference of exactly 4 units. Therefore, this option does not satisfy the condition.

**(D) 8**

If we split the 8-piece stick into two parts, the only way to satisfy the condition is to have one part 6 units long and the other part 2 units long. However, the question asks us to find a way to split the stick so that one piece is twice as long as the other, and 6 is indeed twice 3, but 8 cannot be split into two parts such that one is twice as long as the other. Therefore, this option does not satisfy the condition.

**(E) 10**

If we split the 10-piece stick into two parts, the only way to satisfy the condition is to make one part 8 units long and the other part 2 units long. This satisfies the condition since the 8-unit piece is twice as long as the 2-unit piece.

Based on the analysis, both **(B) 4** and **(E) 10** satisfy the condition that one piece must be twice as long as the other after splitting. Therefore, the correct answer is **both B and E**.

Answer: No Answer.
