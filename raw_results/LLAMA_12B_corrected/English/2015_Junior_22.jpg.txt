Reasoning: 
**Step 1: Understand the question.**

The question is asking how many two-digit numbers can be written as a sum of exactly six different powers of two.

**Step 2: Identify the range of two-digit numbers.**

Two-digit numbers range from 10 to 99.

**Step 3: List out powers of two within the range.**

- $2^0 = 1$
- $2^1 = 2$
- $2^2 = 4$
- $2^3 = 8$
- $2^4 = 16$
- $2^5 = 32$
- $2^6 = 64$

**Step 4: Analyze combinations to form the sum.**

To form a two-digit number using six different powers of two, we must select from the available powers listed in Step 3. We cannot use 2^7 (128) or any higher powers because it exceeds the two-digit range.

**Step 5: Determine valid combinations.**

- Combinations do not include 1 (2^0) for negative numbers
- Combinations do not exceed two digits

**Step 6: Identify permutations of valid combinations to create 2-digit numbers.**

- Use numbers 1,4, 8, 16, 32, 64: There is only one permutation. Not enough to form a 2-digit number on its own.

- Use numbers 1,2, 8, 16, 32, 64: There is only one permutation. Not enough to form a 2-digit number on its own.

- Use numbers 1, 4, 16, 32, 64: There is only one permutation. Not enough to form a 2-digit number on its own.

- Use numbers 2, 4, 16, 32, 64: There is only one permutation possessing a negative sum and several positive combinations.

- Choose combinations (positive projections of 2^0-2^5) between 0-50. There are $20 + 20 + 20 + 5 + 5 + 4 = 74$. Drop even counts over 99. There are 83 positive combinations. Negative projections would double. Thus, total = 83+83=169.

**Step 7: Eliminate answers.**

Ignore options (C), (D), and, find correct answer from (A), or a) (B) or (E):
