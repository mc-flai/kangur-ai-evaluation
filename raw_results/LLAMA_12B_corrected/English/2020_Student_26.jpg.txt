**Reasoning:** To find the area of the quadrilateral, we can divide it into two triangles and then sum the areas. This is a common strategy for solving this type of problem. The key steps involved are to determine the appropriate formula for the area of each triangle and to correctly calculate the areas by substituting the given values. The critical insight is recognizing that the quadrilateral can be divided into meaningful shapes with known areas, which allows us to solve the problem.

**Answer:** B)
