Reasoning: The question asks which lists are complete listings of all possible values of n. A pentagon is called convex if all its internal angles are less than 180°. The number of right angles in a convex pentagon is n. The problem states that the pentagon has five sides and that all its internal angles are less than 180°. This means that each internal angle can range from 0° to 179°. Since the pentagon has five sides, the sum of its internal angles is (5-2) * 180° = 540°. The sum of the internal angles of a convex pentagon can be either: Two right angles (90°) and three acute angles (less than 90°), One right angle (90°) and four acute angles (less than 90°), or Five acute angles (less than 90°). 

Analyzing each option: 
A) 1, 2, 3 - Option (A) includes 1 right angle and 4 acute angles, which is not possible since the three remaining acute angles would have to sum up to more than 270° (540° - 270° = 270°), violating the convexity condition. Option (A) is incorrect. 
B) 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 - Option (B) includes 0 right angles (all acute angles), 1 right angle, 2 right angles, 3 right angles, and 4 right angles. These values are valid since they satisfy the convexity condition. 
C) 0, 1, 2, 3 - Similar to option (A), multiples of 2 or 3 cannot be included separately since the sum will exceed 540°. Option (C) is incorrect. 
D) 0, 1, 2 - The values in option (D) (0 right angles and up to 2 right angles) are not sufficient. Option (D) is incorrect. 
E) 1, 2 - Option (E) is also not correct for the same reason as options (A) and (D): the sum of the angles will not only be less than 540°.

Answer: B)
