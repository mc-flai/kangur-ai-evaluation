Reasoning: The question asks to find the smallest positive integer N for which the sum of its digits is equal to 2021. Let's analyze each option: (A) 10: Sum of digits = 1 + 0 = 1 (not equal to 2021), (B) 12: Sum of digits = 1 + 2 = 3 (not equal to 2021), (C) 19: Sum of digits = 1 + 9 = 10 (not equal to 2021), (D) 28: Sum of digits = 2 + 8 = 10 (not equal to 2021), (E) 2021: Sum of digits = 2 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 5 (not equal to 2021). After analyzing all options, we can see that none of them have a sum of digits equal to 2021. However, we need to find the smallest positive integer N that satisfies this condition. Let's try to find a number with 3 digits: (110, 11 + 0 + 0 = 11, not a valid choice), (210, 2 + 1 + 0 = 3, not a valid choice), (220, 2 + 2 + 0 = 4, not a valid choice), (111, 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, not a valid choice). We can continue trying numbers with different numbers of digits until we find one that satisfies the condition. To solve this problem, we need to think about how to construct a number with a sum of digits equal to 2021. One way to do this is to start with the largest possible digits (9, 9... ) and subtract from it until we reach a smaller number with the remaining sum. We also need to consider the smallest possible digits (1, 1... ) to get closer to the target sum. The correct answer is not available in the provided options. A possible answer could be a number in the form of 9...9x, where x is a smaller number that adds up to 2021 when combined with the preceding 9s.
