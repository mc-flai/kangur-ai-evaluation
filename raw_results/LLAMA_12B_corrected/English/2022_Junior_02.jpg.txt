Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the problem and determine which option is the correct answer. Karo has a box of matches with 30 matches. She can form the number 2022 using some of the matches she forms the number 2022. She has already formed the first two digits (see picture). We need to find out how many matches will be left in the box when she has finished the number. The total number of matches is 30. The number 2022 requires 2+0+2+2 = 6 matches. Since Karo has already formed the first two digits, she needs 6 - 1 - 1 = 4 more matches to finish the number. Therefore, there will be 30 - 4 = 26 matches left in the box.
