Reasoning: To solve this problem, we can use the properties of isosceles triangles and the concept of angle relationships in triangle ABC. Triangle ABC is isosceles with AC = BC, and ∠ABC = 40°. ∠EBA and ∠ECA are the base angles of isosceles triangle ABC. Since the triangle is isosceles, the base angles are congruent. Since AB = BC, ∠EBA = ∠ECA. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. AA_{BCE} is an exterior angle of triangle ABC. The exterior angle is supplementary to the angle opposite the side BC, which is ∠ABC = 40°. Therefore, ∠AA_{BCE} = 180° - 40° = 140°. Since triangle BFA is a right triangle (with FC = x), we have: AF = \sqrt{FC^2 - FB^2}, AF x 2 + x = FB. Substituting FB = ∠CFE, we have 2 xAF + ∠CFE = x, - ∠CFE = 2AF - x. We use the distance formula: - AD^2 - DC^2 = AF^2 - FD^2. - DT = x = AF^2 - DC^2. AD^2 = AF^2 + DC^2 + 2 DF * DC BC^2 = AB^2 + BD^2 - AD^2.
