Reasoning: To determine the side length of the big square, we need to analyze the given information and apply logical reasoning. Here's how we can arrive at this answer: 1. The big square is split into four small squares. 2. The diagonal of each small square touches the center of the big square. 3. Each small square has a side length of 6 cm (since 6 cm is the diagonal of the small square, using the Pythagorean theorem). 4. The diagonal of the big square is the sum of the diagonals of the two small squares above it and the two small squares below it. 5. The diagonal of the big square is equal to the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 8 cm and 8 cm (the diagonals of the two small squares). 6. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the length of the diagonal of the big square: sqrt(8^2 + 8^2) = 8*sqrt(2) cm. 7. The side length of the big square is equal to half the length of its diagonal. 8. Therefore, the side length of the big square is (8*sqrt(2))/2 = 4*sqrt(2) cm. 9. Converting the answer to a common decimal, we get approximately 5.66 cm. 10. However, this answer is not provided in the choices, so we need to consider other possible answers. Since the side length of the big square must be an integer, we can eliminate options (A), (B), and (E). This leaves us with two possible answers: (C) 24 cm and (D) 28 cm. To determine which answer is correct, we need to consider the additional information provided in the prompt. The diagram shows that the numbers from 1 to 14 are written in the hexagons, and some of them are presumably omitted. Since the sum of the three numbers in the hexagon with value 6 is the sum of the numbers from 1 to 11, we can infer that the sum is 36. If we exclude the hexagon with value 8, the remaining numbers in the hexagons would sum up to 24. However, the prompt states that the numbers from 1 to 14 are written in the hexagons, including omitted numbers. Therefore, we can subtract only 2 from the sum of 8.
