Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between the number of options and the number of products sold out in the afternoon.

From option 25, we know there were 12 options available initially. Since only options 1 and 2 were sold out in the morning, the fruits available in the afternoon must have included at least 2 more than those from the morning. Therefore, there must be at least 3 fruit options available in the afternoon. Also, each of them was available in at least 4 different kinds (Remember, you can buy as many kinds as you want for each fruit). So we can have at least $3 \times 4 = 12$ fruits in the afternoon.

Then we turn to the vegetables. There must be at least 4 vegetable options at that time, as only 2 of the available options (2 out of 6) were sold out. And each vegetable option had at least 5 kinds of vegetables since the number of vegetable kinds was 5 according to the problem statement. Hence the total number of vegetables in the afternoon will be $4 \times 5 = 20$. Together with the fruits, we can also get the total number of items (combination of fruit and vegetable) in the afternoon, which is min{max fruit options * max fruit kinds + max vegetable options * max vegetable kinds, 3}. Therefore, the total number of items in the afternoon will be min{12 + 20, 3 + 20}. We see that the smallest value that is larger than or equal to 25 in the equation above is 30.

Now this answer is within the range of possible values provided by the question (actual answer choices).

Therefore, the correct answer to this question is $\boxed{C)}$.
