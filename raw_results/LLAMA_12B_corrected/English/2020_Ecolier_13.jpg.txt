Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of equilateral triangles and how they relate to the crown.

Let's break down the information given:

*   The parts were joined together so that the sides in contact had the same number.
*   Four parts are visible.

We can make an educated guess about the colors based on the visible parts:

*   Since the parts in contact have the same number, it means that adjacent parts must be the same color.
*   From option A), we can see that adjacent parts have the same number (1 and 1), which fits the criteria.
*   From option B), we can see that adjacent parts have the same number (2 and 2), which also fits the criteria.
*   From option C), we can see that adjacent parts do not have the same number (3 and 4), which does not fit the criteria.
*   From option D), we can see that adjacent parts do not have the same number (4 and 5), which does not fit the criteria.
*   From option E), we can see that adjacent parts do not have the same number (2 and 3), which does not fit the criteria.

Based on our analysis, the only option that satisfies the condition of having adjacent parts of the same color is option A) or option B). However, since there are two possible colors in option A) and only one possible color in option B), we can conclude that option B) is more restrictive and therefore a better choice.

The question asks us to determine the number that appears in the colored triangle, which means we need to find the number that is common to all visible parts. We can use the given options to narrow down the possibilities and find the correct answer.

Answer: B)
