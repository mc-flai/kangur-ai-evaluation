Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the task and evaluate each option. The question asks us to find the number of ways Anna can build a tower using five discs of different sizes. Anna has five discs of different sizes. She wants to use four of them to build a tower. The task is to determine how many ways she can arrange these four discs to build the tower. Option A) states that there are 4 ways to arrange the discs. This is incorrect because it doesn't consider the different sizes of the discs. Option B) states that there are 9 ways to arrange the discs. This is also incorrect because it doesn't consider the different sizes of the discs. Option C) states that there are 12 ways to arrange the discs. This is incorrect because it doesn't consider the different sizes of the discs. Option D) states that there are 20 ways to arrange the discs. This is also incorrect because it doesn't consider the different sizes of the discs. Option E) states that there are 10 ways to arrange the discs. This is incorrect because it doesn't consider the different sizes of the discs. However, we must consider that the question states "how many ways are there for Anna to build the tower?" which implies that we should consider combinations, not permutations. Since the discs are of different sizes, we must consider all possible combinations. The correct answer is: **10**.
