Reasoning: To find the area of the central square, we need to determine the length of its side. Given that it is formed by four identical rectangles and has an area equal to the sum of the areas of two squares formed by its diagonals, we can use the relationship between the diagonal and the sides of a square. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. If a square is formed by the diagonals of the central squares and the rectangles, the area is $64\;\text{cm}^2$. This suggests that each side of the central square has a length of $8\;\text{cm}$, as $8^2 = 64$. However, this contradicts our information about the diagonals and the "lower square" as we will see later. Let's consider the areas of the rectangles and squares more accurately. Each rectangle contributes to an area of $81\;\text{cm}^2$ and shares that area with the squares formed by the diagonals (8 cm, as previously calculated). Thus, if each rectangle's side length is a multiple of $3\;\text{cm}$, the diagonal of the smaller square will be matched, determining the length of the central square. $36\;\text{cm}^2$ is the correct area of the central square. This conclusion comes from establishing the sides to be multiples of $3\;\text{cm}$ and calculating the diagonal of the central squares to obtain the area of $36\;\text{cm}^2$.
