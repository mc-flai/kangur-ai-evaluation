Reasoning: The question asks about the age of the sisters, based on consecutive integers with a sum of answers being certain values. The question describes the ages of the sisters as consecutive integers, so they are likely man+1, man+2, man+3, man+4, man+5, and man+6, for some value of man. Using the scenarios above, one can quickly find that the values of 95, 125, 167, and 205 DON'T work because they don't add up correctly (i.e., reduce to consecutive numbers). Therefore, the only possibility that works for consecutive integers and their sums is option E).

Answer: E)
