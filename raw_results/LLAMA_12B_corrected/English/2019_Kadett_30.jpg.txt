Reasoning: The train consists of 18 carriages. There are 700 passengers on the train. In each five successive carriages there are exactly 199 passengers in total. To find the number of passengers in one set of five carriages, we divide the total number of passengers by the number of sets: 700 passengers / 18 carriages = 38.8888 passengers per carriage. However, this does not give us the number of passengers in one set of five carriages. We know that in each five successive carriages there are exactly 199 passengers in total. So, we need to divide the total number of passengers by the number of sets to get the actual number of passengers in one set of five carriages: 199 passengers / 5 carriages = 39.8 passengers per carriage. Now, we need to find out how many passengers are left over when we divide the total number of passengers by the number of sets. To do this, we multiply the number of passengers in one set by the number of sets: 5 sets x 39.8 passengers per set = 199 passengers, leaving a remainder of 0 passengers. This means that all passengers are evenly distributed across the 5 sets of carriages. Since the passengers are evenly distributed, the number of passengers in the two middle carriages of the train will be half of the number of passengers in one set of five carriages: 199 passengers in one set / 2 = 99.5 passengers in the two middle carriages. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a passenger, we round down to the nearest whole number: 99.5 passengers â‰ˆ 99 passengers < 100 passengers. Since the problem states that each set of five cars has exactly 199 passengers in total, we can infer that the remaining cars also have the same number of passengers as the first set of cars. From the options provided, we can see that there is no option that matches our calculation exactly. However, since the problem asks for the approximate number of passengers in the two middle carriages, we can choose the option closest to our calculated value: 60 passengers (A) and 23/2 passengers (B) are too small.
