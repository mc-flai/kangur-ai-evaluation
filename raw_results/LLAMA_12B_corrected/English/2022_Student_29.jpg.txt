Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the sequence $\langle a_n\rangle$. The sequence starts with $a_1 = 1$. Each term is obtained by subtracting 1 from the previous term and then multiplying by 2 (i.e., $a_n = 2a_{n-1} - 1$ for $n \geq 2$). We are given that $a_2 = a_1 + 1 = 2$. Therefore, $a_2 = 2$. Now, let's analyze the options: Option A: $a_1 = 2$ - This is incorrect because $a_1 = 1$, not 2. Option B: $a_1 = 2$ - This is also incorrect for the same reason as above. Option C: $a_1 = 3$ - This is incorrect because $a_1 = 1$, not 3. Option D: $a_1 = 4$ - This is incorrect because $a_1 = 1$, not 4. Option E: $a_1 = 5$ - This is the correct option. We started with the initial value of the sequence, $a_1 = 1$. Then, we used the recursive formula to find the next term, $a_2 = 2a_1 - 1 = 2(1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$ is incorrect and $a_2 = a_1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$. We verified that this is consistent with the given information.
