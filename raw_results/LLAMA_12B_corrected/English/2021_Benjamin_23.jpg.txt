Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the motion of the black teeth on each gear after a full turn has been completed.

Each tooth moves forward one space when any other tooth moves forward. Initially, all gears begin in their first positions.

The black teeth move:
* Clockwise an equal number of spaces each, only on gears that are rotated counterclockwise.
* Counterclockwise the same number of spaces on gears that are rotated clockwise.
* An odd number of teeth spaces if a gear is moved an odd number of spaces and an even number of spaces if moved an even number of spaces.

Comparing the black teeth:
* The pink and blue gears were both moved the same number of spaces forward (closer to the top).
* The purple gear was rotated clockwise and equals that of the other two gears.
* The gray gear is the correct answer, since it would not have enough space to align with the other black teeth when it turned.

Of the options provided, **(E)** fits the description of the gray gear showing the correct position of the black teeth.

**Final answer:** The correct answer is (E).  
Answer: E)
