**Reasoning:**

To determine which number is closest to the product of 20.15 and 51.02, we need to calculate this product.

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

*   Multiply the decimals:
    *   20.15 x 51.02 =
    *   First, multiply 20 by 51: 1020
    *   Then, multiply 0.15 by 51: 7.65
    *   Next, multiply 20 by 0.02: 0.4
    *   Finally, add up all these products: 1020 + 7.65 + 0.4 = 1027.05

The result is approximately 1027.05.

Now, comparing our calculated result (1027.05) with the given options:

*   A) 1000: Too low
*   B) 1000: Too low
*   C) 10000: Too high
*   D) 100000: Too high
*   E) 1000000: Too high

Therefore, the closest number to the product of 20.15 x 51.02 among the given options is not explicitly listed, or rather all the options provided are not as close as the calculated value of approximately 1027.05. However, if we must choose from the given options:

**Answer:** No Answer.
