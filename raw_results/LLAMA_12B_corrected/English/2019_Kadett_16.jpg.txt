Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of line symmetry and how it relates to paper folding. When folding a square piece of paper twice along its two lines, as shown in the picture, the resulting pieces of paper are then unfolded if possible. This means we are looking for the number of ways the paper can be folded such that each fold creates a line of symmetry. In this case, the folds create two lines of symmetry (dotted lines), each perpendicular to the other. These lines divide the square paper into four equal parts. Each part can be folded along its edge to create another line of symmetry. Given that there are two lines of symmetry created by the initial folds, and considering the unfolded paper can be folded along the edges of the resulting quadrants, each fold along an edge will create another line of symmetry. Therefore, starting with the two initial folds, we add one more line of symmetry for each quadrant (top-right, top-left, bottom-right, bottom-left), bringing the total to 8. This reasoning demonstrates an understanding of how folds create lines of symmetry, showing that multiple folds can generate various symmetrical patterns in a square piece of paper.
