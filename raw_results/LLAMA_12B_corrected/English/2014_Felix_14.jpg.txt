Reasoning: We are asked to find the biggest number that can be formed by summing two numbers that consist of the digits 2, 3, 4, and 5 each, and these two numbers are placed in a square. The options given are: (A) 68, (B) 77, (C) 86, (D) 95, (E) 97. Evaluating each option: Option (A): 68 can be formed by (23+45) or (54+13). Option (B): 77 does not have a clear combination. Option (C): 86 can be formed by (23+53). Option (D): 95 can be formed by (23+72). Option (E): 97 does not have a clear combination. Given the available options, (D) 95 is the biggest number that can be formed using the digits 2, 3, 4, and 5, by adding two numbers that fill a square when placed side by side.
