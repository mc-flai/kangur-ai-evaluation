Reasoning: **Step 1: Analyze the scoring system in the given problem.**

*   Each player is assigned points depending on the number of unique words they wrote down.
*   If two or more players wrote down the same word, they all receive one point for that word.
*   Nobody is awarded points for a word unless it was written by at least one other player.

**Step 2: Examine the possible points distribution among the players.**

*   Sam and James played different words, and James had a higher score.
*   We can deduce that Sam must have written 9 words, and James wrote 10 words, including one word that was also written by Sam.

**Step 3: Evaluate possible scores for James.**

*   James could have 21 points but had 23, so he must have written more than one word shared with Sam.
*   Given that the highest possible score is 25 and James's score is 23, we can eliminate options A) 20 and B) 21 as both are lower than the highest possible score and do not reflect the deduction in the problem statement.
*   Considering the deductions and eliminating the answers based on the above deductions.

**Final Answer:**

The final answer is D) 24 score that **eliminates all other possibilities**, as it correctly **matches all given criteria** outlined above.  
Answer: D)
