Reasoning: To solve question 11, we need to analyze the given information and use logical reasoning. The problem states that four equally big squares are partially colored in black. We are asked to determine which of the four squares is the total area of the black parts biggest. Let's examine each option: - **Option A**: In this scenario, two squares have a smaller area covered by black color compared to the other two squares. - **Option B**: Here, one square has a smaller black area compared to the other three squares, while the remaining squares have a larger black area. - **Option C**: In this case, three squares have a smaller black area compared to the fourth square, which has a larger black area. - **Option D**: This option shows all four squares with equal black areas. However, we are told that the total area of the black parts is always equally big. This means that regardless of how the black areas are distributed among the squares, their total areas remain constant. Therefore, the correct answer is **Option D**, as it presents all four squares with equal black areas, ensuring the total area of the black parts remains consistent.  
Answer: D)
