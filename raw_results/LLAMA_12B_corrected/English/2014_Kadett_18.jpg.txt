Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. First, we need to find the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by the long side and the side opposite the long side. Let's call the length of the hypotenuse "h". We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find "h": h^2 = 6^2 + (opposite side)^2. Since the opposite side is also a part of the rectangle, its length is the same as the width of the rectangle, which is 11 cm. h^2 = 6^2 + 11^2. h^2 = 36 + 121. h^2 = 157. h = sqrt(157). Now, we have to find which option includes three pieces whose total length equals the length of the hypotenuse. Option D is "4 cm, 3 cm, 4 cm" and when we add these up we get 11 cm, which is the hypotenuse length. Option D is correct. So, our solution is Option D.

Answer: D)
