Reasoning: To find the smallest possible number of this arithmetic mean, we need to first understand what an arithmetic mean is. The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers is equal to the sum of the numbers divided by the count of numbers. In this case, we are looking for the arithmetic mean of five different prime numbers. The first step is to identify the prime numbers in the options provided. Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. From the given options, the prime numbers are 5, 7, and 11. Next, we need to find the sum of these prime numbers. The sum is 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 = 53. Finally, we divide the sum by the count of numbers, which is 5.
