Reasoning: The numbers from 1 to 9 should be distributed among the 9 squares in the diagram according to the following rules: There should be one number in each square. The sum of three adjacent numbers is always a multiple of 3. The numbers 3 and 1 are already placed. For a number to be placed in any square, its digit sum with the adjacent digits must be a multiple of 3. Since 3 and 1 are already placed, we need to find the remaining numbers that satisfy this condition. We can start by considering the possible placements of the remaining numbers: If a number is placed next to 3, its digit sum with 3 must be a multiple of 3. If a number is placed next to 1, its digit sum with 1 must be a multiple of 3. Let's consider each option: A) 9 - This number can be placed next to 3 (9 + 3 = 12, which is a multiple of 3). However, there is no number that can be placed next to 1 such that its digit sum with 1 is a multiple of 3 (1 + x â‰  3k for any integer x and k). B) 12 - This number cannot be placed next to 3 (12 + 3 = 15, which is not a multiple of 3). However, it can be placed next to 1 (12 + 1 = 13, which is not a multiple of 3). C) 15 - This number cannot be placed next to 3 (15 + 3 = 18, which is a multiple of 3). However, it cannot be placed next to 1 (15 + 1 = 16, which is not a multiple of 3). D) 18 - This number cannot be placed next to 3 (18 + 3 = 21, which is a multiple of 3). However, it cannot be placed next to 1 (18 + 1 = 19, which is not a multiple of 3). E) 24 - This number cannot be placed next to 3 (24 + 3 = 27, which is a multiple.
