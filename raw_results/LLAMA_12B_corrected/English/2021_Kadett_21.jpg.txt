Reasoning: To determine which set of pins belongs to Yvonne, we need to analyze the statements made by each of her five friends. Zach claims to have an even number of pins, which means he cannot have any unmatched pairs (i.e., two of a kind) because having two gives you an odd number and only whole numbers are considered. Therefore, his pins must be all different. Sue does not have any moons, which means her set must include all the remaining stars because her set must include all the other planets (asteroid, Mars, Jupiter). Paul claims to have more moons than stars, meaning he must have at least two moons and no stars. Xenia claims to have an even number of pins, which means she cannot have any unmatched pairs. Thus, her collection also includes all different pins. Given these constraints: Options A) and D) cannot belong to Yvonne because they include all different objects, contradicting Zach's even number of pins claim. Option B) is not possible because it doesn't satisfy Xenia's condition of having an even number of pins; the two stars and the Jupiter moon add up to an odd number when paired, making it impossible. Option C) is the only one that doesn't contradict any group member's claim. It has an odd number of pins, meaning it fits with Xenia and Yvonne's statements, and it includes an asteroid and two moons, which satisfy Sue's criteria without overlapping sets for any of the other friends. The final answer is C).
Answer: C)
