Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the arrangement of cards and how they can be rearranged. Each card has 2 numbers on it with 1 of them written upside down. The teacher wants to rearrange the cards so that the sum of the numbers in the top row is equal to the sum of the numbers in the bottom row.

Let's analyze the given options:

Now, let's consider the possible rearrangements:

1. **Option A**: If we turn the card labeled "7" upside down, the sum of the top row becomes 7 + 4 = 11, and the sum of the bottom row becomes 7 + 4 = 11. This means option A is a valid solution.

2. **Option B**: If we turn the card labeled "5" upside down, the sum of the top row becomes 5 + 3 = 8, and the sum of the bottom row becomes 2 + 8 = 10. This does not meet the condition, so option B is not a valid solution.

3. **Option C**: If we turn the card labeled "9" upside down, the sum of the top row becomes 9 + 6 = 15, and the sum of the bottom row becomes 6 + 9 = 15. This meets the condition, making option C a valid solution.

4. **Option D**: If we turn the card labeled "4" upside down, the sum of the top row becomes 4 + 3 = 7, and the sum of the bottom row becomes 2 + 4 = 6. This does not meet the condition, so option D is not a valid solution.

5. **Option E**: If we turn the card labeled "8" upside down, the sum of the top row becomes 8 + 7 = 15, and the sum of the bottom row becomes 7 + 8 = 15. This meets the condition, making option E a valid solution.

Based on the analysis above, the correct answers are:

(A) A
(C) C
(E) E

Therefore, the best answer is:

Answer: A), C), E)
