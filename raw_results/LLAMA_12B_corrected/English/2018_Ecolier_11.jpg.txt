Reasoning: To determine the smallest number of shapes Tom needs to cover his paper boat, we need to count the number of squares that make up the entire boat. The boat is divided into three sections: the bow (front), the deck (middle), and the stern (back). The bow contains 4 squares. The deck contains 10 squares. The stern contains 8 squares. In total, there are 4 + 10 + 8 = 22 squares needed to cover the entire boat. Therefore, Tom would need 22 shapes.
