Reasoning: 

To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of interior angles of a polygon and their relationship with the sum of angles in a triangle.

Given:
- The polygon is closed.
- Vertices are the midpoints of the edges of the die.

Since the vertex of each face of the polygon forms a triangle with two adjacent edges of the die, we can consider these triangles for finding the interior angle.

The sum of interior angles of any polygon with n sides is given by the formula (n-2)*180 degrees.

For a hexagonal face (which is not a regular hexagon in this case), the interior angle can be calculated using the properties of a regular hexagon.

A regular hexagon has six equal sides and angles, each measuring 120 degrees.

By identifying one of these angles as an interior angle, we can calculate the sum of all interior angles for the hexagonal face.
