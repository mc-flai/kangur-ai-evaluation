Reasoning: To find the value of $h$, we can use the fact that the area of a square is equal to the square of its side length. Since the area of the small square is 1, the side length of this square is 1 unit. The side length of the larger square formed by the five smaller squares is $3 + 3.5 + 4 + 4.2 + 4.5 = 19$ units. Since the small square indicated has area 1, the side length of this square is also 1 unit. Now, let's calculate the area of the larger square formed by the five smaller squares: Area of larger square = Side length of larger square × Side length of larger square = 19 × 19 = 361. Since each answer option represents the value of $h$, we need to find the value of $h$ that corresponds to an area of 361. By analyzing the options, we find that option D represents the value of $h$ that corresponds to an area of 361. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 4.2 m.

Answer: D)
