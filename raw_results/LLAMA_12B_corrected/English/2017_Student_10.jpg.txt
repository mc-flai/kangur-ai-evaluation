**Reasoning:**

To determine which functions have the most intersections with the graph of $f(x) = x$,
we need to find the points where each function and $f(x)$ intersect.
A function $f(x)$ intersects the graph of $f(x) = x$ only when $f(x) = f(x)$,
which is always true since both sides are equal to $f(x)$.

However, for a function to intersect the graph of $f(x)$ more than once,
it must be possible for different $x$ values to satisfy $f(x) = f(x)$.
This implies that the function must be periodic or have multiple solutions for $f(x) = x$.

Given the functions:

(A) $g_1(x) = x^2$: The function $g_1(x)$ is not periodic,
and for any $x$, $g_1(x) = x^2 \neq x$ unless $x = 0$.
Therefore, it intersects the graph of $f(x)$ only once at $x = 0$.

(B) $g_2(x) = x^3$: Similar to $g_1(x)$,
the function $g_2(x)$ is not periodic, and $(x, x^3)$ intersects $(x, x)$
only once at $x = 0$.

(C) $g_3(x) = x^4$: This function behaves similarly,
meeting $(x, x)$ only once at $x = 0$.

(D) $g_4(x) = -x^4$: This function is also not periodic,
intersecting $(x, x)$ only once at $x = 0$.

(E) $g_5(x) = -x$: The function $g_5(x)$ intersects $(x, x)$ at every odd integer.
It meets the condition of buying the graph of $f(x)$ more than twice,
at all integral points.
