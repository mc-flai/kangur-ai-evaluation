Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the effect of a 60% increase in blue frogs and a 60% decrease in green frogs on the total number of frogs. Initially, let's assume there are 100 frogs, with 60 being blue and 40 being green. Initially, Total Frogs = 60 (blue) + 40 (green) = 100. Now, the number of blue frogs increases by 60%, which means they become: 60 x 1.6 = 96. And the number of green frogs decreases by 60%, which means they become: 40 x 0.4 = 16. So, after the change, the new ratio of blue frogs to green frogs is: 96 (blue) / 16 (green) = 6:1. This matches the original ratio of 6:1, as there are still six times more blue frogs than green frogs. The total number of frogs has decreased from 100 to 96 + 16 = 112. Therefore, by what percentage has the total number of frogs changed? 
Answer: D) 40%.
