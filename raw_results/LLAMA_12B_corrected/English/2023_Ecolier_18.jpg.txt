Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of origami and how they relate to geometric shapes. In origami, paper folding can create various geometric shapes by manipulating its layers and creases. A square piece of paper can be used to create different shapes, including nets for cubes, pyramids, or other polyhedra. The fact that Rebecca folds the paper twice and cuts off one corner implies that she is creating a net for a three-dimensional shape. The folded edges and the cut-off corner suggest the presence of a crease that divides the paper into two equal parts, which is characteristic of folding along a plane of symmetry. Based on the given instructions—folding a square piece of paper twice and cutting off one corner—and understanding the principles of origami and geometric shapes, the correct answer would align with an option that demonstrates the initial square with incorporated fold lines leading to a more complex shape, such as a pyramid or a cube, through an intermediate state like that shown in **(B)**, which clearly illustrates a two-fold pattern leading to the distinct geometric figure as would be expected from the explained transformations.

Answer: B)
