Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the given information and apply logical reasoning. The problem states that the length of the tail of the biggest crocodile in a zoo is one-third of the total length of the crocodile. It also mentions that the head is 93cm long and makes up one quarter of the length of the crocodile without its tail included.

Let's denote the total length of the crocodile as x cm. According to the problem, the length of the head is 93cm, which is one quarter of the length of the crocodile without its tail included. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

93 = (1/4)(x - tail)

Since the length of the tail is one-third of the total length of the crocodile, we can express it as:

tail = (1/3)x

Substituting this expression into the previous equation, we get:

93 = (1/4)(x - (1/3)x)

Simplifying the equation, we have:

93 = (1/4)(2/3)x

Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:

372 = (2/3)x

Multiplying both sides by 3/2, we get:

558 = x

So, the total length of the crocodile is 558 cm.

Now, let's find the length of the tail. Since the length of the tail is one-third of the total length of the crocodile, we have:

tail = (1/3)(558)

tail = 186 cm

Therefore, the correct answer is option E) 186cm.

Answer: E) 186cm
