Reasoning: To determine the smallest number of stars that can be replaced by " + ", we need to analyze the given equation and look for patterns or transformations that allow us to minimize the replacements. The equation is a simple multiplication table where every element is the product of two numbers. We want to replace as many of these elements as possible with "+", which means we are looking for any pattern or rule that allows us to substitute a multiplication operation with a simple addition. Upon closer inspection, we can observe a clear pattern in the multiplication table. Each row represents numbers multiplied by 2, and each column represents numbers multiplied by 5. Every element in the table is a product of these two numbers (2 and 5), which means they are always multiples of 10. With this understanding, we can simplify the pattern to recognize that all elements in the table are equivalent to "+0", because when you multiply 0 by any number, the result is always 0. Given this insight, we can replace all the stars in the table with "+0", effectively creating the equation: 2*0 + 1*0 + 2*0 + 0 + 1*0 + 5 + 2*0 + 0 + 1*0 + 5 + 0 = - The small number of stars that can be replaced by "+" is directly related to the number of zero-based multiplications we can replace with "+0" without altering the equation's value. The final answer is 14.
