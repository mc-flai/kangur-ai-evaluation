Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the principles of pressure and fluid dynamics. The water in the glass will create pressure due to its weight. This pressure will be transferred through the water column and can be calculated using hydrostatic pressure. 

Let's identify the key elements from the question:

*   The height of each glass is the same.
*   The water level in both glasses is at the same height.
*   The left glass is upright, while the right one rests against the other one at a slant.
*   The water level in the leaning glass touches its bottom in exactly one point.

Hydrostatic pressure can be calculated using the formula: $P = \rho gh$, where:

*   $P$ is the pressure,
*   $\rho$ is the density of the fluid (water in this case),
*   $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and
*   $h$ is the height of the fluid column.

However, since both glasses have water of the same height and the same level in the upright glass and the leaning glass starts touching its bottom at exactly one point (implying the pressure at that point is the same against both parts of the base of the upright glass), the hydrostatic pressure consideration doesn't directly contribute to the difference in water content between the two.

Given that one glass is upright and the other leans, the angle at which the leaning glass meets the bottom will affect the base area exposed to the water level. The leaning glass touches its bottom at exactly one point, meaning its base area exposed to water is smaller than that of the upright glass. This difference in base area exposed to water explains why the amount of water in each glass will be different despite having the same height.

The relative volume of water within each glass will depend on the angle at which the water surface intersects the glass's base. In a vertically standing glass, the entire base of the glass is exposed to the water level, contributing its full volume. For the leaning glass, the smaller horizontal base area exposed to water means less volume of water.
