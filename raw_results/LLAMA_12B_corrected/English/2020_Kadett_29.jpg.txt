Reasoning: The question describes a process where Sonia writes three consecutive whole numbers, one on each side of a triangle. Then she writes on each vertex of the triangle the sum of the numbers written on the sides that touch this vertex and multiplies these three numbers to obtain the product 504. Let's denote the three consecutive whole numbers as x, x+1, and x+2. When multiplying these numbers together, we get: x * (x+1) * (x+2) = 504. We can solve for x by trial and error or using algebra. By testing different values of x, we find that x = 7 satisfies the equation: 7 * 8 * 9 = 504. Therefore, the three consecutive whole numbers are 7, 8, and 9. To find the product of the three numbers written on the sides of the triangle, we multiply the middle number by the two adjacent numbers: 7 * 8 = 56, 7 * 9 = 63, 8 * 9 = 72. The sum of these three products is: 56 + 63 + 72 = 191. However, this is not the product we are looking for. The question asks for the product of the three numbers written on the sides of the triangle, which is actually 504. Since 504 is not the product of the numbers written on the sides of the triangle, but rather the product of the three numbers written on the vertices of the triangle, we need to look for another option that represents the product 504. 
Answer: E) 336 is not correct; the correct answer is their product: 7*8*9 = **504**
