Reasoning: Elisabeth starts with 60 pralines and eats $1/10$ of them, leaving her with $(1 - 1/10) \cdot 60 = 54$ pralines. On the next day, she eats $1/9$ of the remaining $54$ pralines, leaving her with $(1 - 1/9) \cdot 54 = 48$ pralines. On the third day, she eats $1/8$ of the remaining $48$ pralines, leaving her with $(1 - 1/8) \cdot 48 = 42$ pralines. On the fourth day, she eats $1/7$ of the remaining $42$ pralines, leaving her with $(1 - 1/7) \cdot 42 = 30$ pralines. Finally, she eats $1/2$ of the remaining $30$ pralines, leaving her with $(1 - 1/2) \cdot 30 = 15$ pralines. Therefore, after all the days, Elisabeth has **15** pralines left. Comparing the options: A) 15 pralines B) 10 pralines incorrectly left aside on the third day C) 12 pralines not accounted for in her correct calculation D) 20 pralines not included in her total count E) All other amounts calculate the same remaining pralines Therefore, option **A) 15 pralines** is correct.
