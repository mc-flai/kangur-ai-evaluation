Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between a square and its diagonal.

*   A diagonal of a square divides it into two right-angled triangles.
*   The sides of the triangles are in the ratio of 1:1:\sqrt{2} (by Pythagoras' theorem).
*   Given that the side length of the triangle is 6, 10, and 11, we can deduce that the side length of the square must be \boxed{6}.
