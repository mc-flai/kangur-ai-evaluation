Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the color patterns for each side of the triangles and their possible arrangements. Let's break down the information:

1. **Number of Sides**: There are 9 sides of triangles in the picture.
2. **Color Already Applied**: Three sides have colors already applied.
3. **Colors Available**: Blue, green, red.
4. **Requirement**: Each triangle must have sides colored in three different colors.

Given that there are nine sides to be colored and three are already colored, we need at least one more color than the three already applied to meet the requirement of having all triangles with sides colored in three different colors.

**Option Analysis**:

- **A) Only Blue**: Since three sides are already colored and at least one more color is needed in every triangle, and blue is one of the existing colors, this could potentially satisfy the condition under certain arrangements.

- **B) Only Green**: Similar reasoning as with blue applies here. Green is another existing color, which could satisfy the condition under the right arrangement.

- **C) Only Red**: Given the same logic, red, being one of the colors already used, could also make up for the color shortage when distributed among the triangles.

- **D) Each of the Three Colours Is Possible**: This option suggests that all three colors (blue, green, red) can complete the coloring of the triangles without needing additional colors beyond what's already used. However, since not all triangles in the figure would have their sides colored with these three colors if only the three already colored were present, this option doesn't fit perfectly with our analysis.

- **E) The Colouring Described Is Not Possible**: This option suggests that it's impossible to meet the requirement with the given conditions, which contradicts our analysis that allows for distributions that meet the three-color per triangle rule by using the already applied colors plus adding at least one of the appearance colors to complete each set of sides.

In order to meet the requirement, we must consider how many colors can be efficiently distributed across the 9 sides, ensuring each triangle has sides of all three colors. Given that there are existing colors to use as part of the three needed for each triangle (since three sides are already colored), options A, B, and C could potentially allow each triangle to have sides colored in three different colors by spreading them out efficiently.

Therefore, the correct answer choice acknowledging this possibility is:

Answer: E) The Colouring Described Is Not Possible.
