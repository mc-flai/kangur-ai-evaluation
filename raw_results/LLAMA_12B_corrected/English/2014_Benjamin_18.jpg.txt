Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the information provided about the faces of a die and understand the conditions given. **Step 1: Identify the common edges between pairs of faces.** The faces labeled with numbers 1 and 2 have one common edge. This implies that the faces with labels 1 and 2 share a common side. **Step 2: Determine which pair of faces does not share any common edges.** By observation, faces 1 and 6, faces 1 and 5, faces 6 and 2, faces 6 and 5, faces 6 and 4, and faces 4 and 2 all share common edges with other pairs of faces. Therefore, the pair of faces that does not share any common edges is faces 1 and 4. **Conclusion:** Based on the given information and analysis, the correct answer is that the face opposite to face 4 is face 1.
