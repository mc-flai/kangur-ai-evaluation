Reasoning: The question asks to find two-digit numbers where if one of the digits is deleted, the resulting number is a factor of the original number. For option A, if we delete one digit, it leaves only one digit, which cannot be a factor of any number (except 1). Therefore, option A is incorrect. For option B, if we delete the 9, we are left with 0, which is not a valid digit and cannot be a factor of any number. Therefore, option B is also incorrect. For option C, if we delete the 1, we are left with 4, which is not a factor of 14. Therefore, option C is also incorrect. For option D, if we delete the 1, we are left with 9, which is a factor of 19. However, if we delete the 9, we are left with 1, which is not a factor of 19. Therefore, option D is incorrect. For option E, if we delete the 2, we are left with 3, which is not a factor of 23. Therefore, option E is also incorrect. Based on our analysis, the correct answer is none of the given options.
