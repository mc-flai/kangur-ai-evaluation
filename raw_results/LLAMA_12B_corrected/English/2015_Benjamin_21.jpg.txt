Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to determine which combination of 3 or 4 squares can remove from the net, so that the other 6 squares remain connected and can be made into a cube. A train typically has several carriages with multiple compartments. Let's break down the options: If only 4 squares are removed, there would be 10 squares remaining. This is not possible since the remaining squares cannot form a cube of volume 10. Cubes have specific volumes determined by the number of their side faces, edges, and corners. If only 7 squares are removed, there would be 3 squares remaining. This is not sufficient to form a cube, as cubes require at least 6 square faces to enclose their shape. Removing only 3 or 4 squares would leave us with 7 or 8 squares. However, we cannot determine whether these remaining squares can form a cube without visualizing how they could be arranged. This option indicates that if exactly 3 squares are removed, there are 9 squares left, which cannot form a cube of volume 9. If 7 squares are removed, there are 5 squares left, which also cannot form a cube. Considering the constraints of cube formation, this option looks promising. Removing only 3 squares leaves us with 9 squares. Although theoretically not impossible, ensuring that dihedral angles of six faces enclose a Platonic solid without patent voids would require careful positioning. Removing only 4 squares would leave us with 8 squares. As with the previous case, it becomes extremely challenging to guarantee that the final cube contains no dangling exterior projections and completes a pure cube. Lastly, keeping 7 squares and removing 3 (as opposed to the converse) can also yield under different arrangements, but such outcome would depend heavily on placing capabilities. The only feasible principle representation could be (E), only three points at the cube vertices, four face clus.
