Reasoning: The question states that a box has fewer than 50 cookies. The cookies can be divided evenly between 2, 3, or 4 children. However, they cannot be divided evenly between 7 children because 6 more cookies would be needed. To find the number of cookies, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, and 4. LCM(2, 3, 4) = 12. If 12 is a valid answer, it means that the number of cookies is equal to 12. If 12 + 6 is not divisible by 7, then 12 is not a valid answer. 12 + 6 = 18, 18 % 7 != 0. Therefore, 12 is not a valid answer. Other options are 24, 30, 36, and 48. 24 mod 2 = 0, 24 mod 3 = 0, 24 mod 4 = 0, 24 mod 7 = 4. 30 mod 2 = 0, 30 mod 3 = 0, 30 mod 4 = 2, 30 mod 7 = 6. 36 mod 2 = 0, 36 mod 3 = 0, 36 mod 4 = 0, 36 mod 7 = 4. 48 mod 2 = 0, 48 mod 3 = 0, 48 mod 4 = 0, 48 mod 7 = 0. Only 48 is divisible by 7. Therefore, the correct answer is C) 48.
