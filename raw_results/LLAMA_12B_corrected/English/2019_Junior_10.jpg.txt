Reasoning: The pattern of the numbers is similar to that of phone numbers, where digits 0-9 are used for identification. The last digit corresponds to the final exposure or final result of an exposure time, which is the maximum length that this pattern can be. Option A) 10 is an extension length value and is not a valid length for a word formed by multiple digits. Option B) 18 is the length of a word (without spaces) formed by three digits, which is not in the given range. Option C) 68 corresponds to the length of a long name, which is beyond the range usually acceptable in this type of question. Option D) 78 is not a typical length for a phone number and is not an extension length value. Option E) 98 also does not fit the criteria for an extension length value. The only option that follows the rule is option A) 10.
Answer: A)
