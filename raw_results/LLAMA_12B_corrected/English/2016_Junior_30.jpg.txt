Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of how many hands are shaken in the conference. The given information states that exactly 2016 people are taking part in a conference and they are registered as P1 to P2016 in the system. Each person from P1 to P2015 has shaken exactly the amount of other hands that his/her own system number indicates. Let's analyze the options: (A) 1 This option suggests that each person has shaken only one hand. However, since the total number of people is 2016, this would mean that each person would have shaken only one hand, which is not possible as the number of handshakes would be equal to the number of people, resulting in 2016 handshakes. (B) 504 This option suggests that each person has shaken 504 hands. Since there are 2016 people, the total number of handshakes would be 504 * 2016 = 1,017,984. However, this seems to be an excessive number of handshakes as the number of people is relatively small compared to the total number of handshakes. (C) 672 This option suggests that each person has shaken 672 hands. Since there are 2016 people, the total number of handshakes would be 672 * 2016 = 1,354,272. However, this is still a large number of handshakes, as we would expect the number of handshakes to be significantly lower given the relatively small number of people. (D) 1008 This option suggests that each person has shaken 1008 hands. Since there are 2016 people, the total number of handshakes would be 1008 * 2016 = 2,029,568. This option also seems unreasonable as the number of handshakes would be more than double than the number of people, which does not make logical sense. (E) 2015 This option suggests that each person has shaken 2015 hands. Since there are 2016 people, the total number of handshakes would be 2015 * 2016 = 4,072,640. As with the previous options, this is also an unreasonable number of handshakes. Considering these calculations, none of the options seem plausible, as the calculated total number of handshakes exceeds the combined value of the total number of people that carry out the handshakes.
