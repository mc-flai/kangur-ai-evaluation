Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the positions of the two snails at the end of one hour. Both snails start at the corner S and move in opposite directions along the outside edge of the garden. One snail crawls 1 m in one hour, and the fast snail crawls 2 m in one hour. To determine their positions after one hour, we can calculate how far each snail will have moved. The slow snail will have moved 1 m in one hour, while the fast snail will have moved 2 m in one hour. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we need to consider the distance between them. In one hour, the fast snail will be ahead of the slow snail by 1 m (since it moves at a faster rate). This means that after one hour, the fast snail will be 1 m away from the starting point S, while the slow snail will still be at the starting point S.
