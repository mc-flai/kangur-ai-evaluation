Reasoning: The problem states that from a list of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, Monika chooses 3 different numbers whose sum is 8. Then, Daniel chooses 3 different numbers whose sum is 7. To find the combinations of 3 numbers that add up to 8, we can list all possible combinations: 1 + 2 + 5 = 8, 1 + 3 + 4 = 8, 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 (invalid since it repeats a number). To find the combinations of 3 numbers that add up to 7, we can list all possible combinations: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7, 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 (invalid since it repeats a number), 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 (invalid since it repeats a number). Comparing the valid combinations for Monika and Daniel, we find that there is only one common combination: 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 (Monika) and 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 (Daniel). This means that the only choice of numbers that satisfy both conditions is 1, 2, and 5. Therefore, the correct answer is B) 1, because it is the only option that corresponds to the combination 1, 2, and 5. 
Answer: B) 1
