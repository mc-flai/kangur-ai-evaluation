Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the given information and apply logical reasoning. The question asks us to find the missing number in the sequence 2, 0, 2, 1. We are also told that when the five pieces are fitted together correctly, the result is a rectangle with a calculation written on it. The first step is to recognize that the numbers 2, 0, 2, and 1 are likely the dimensions of the rectangle when placed horizontally and vertically. If we arrange these numbers in the format of width x height, we get 2 x 0, 2 x 2, and 1 x 1. The calculation written on the rectangle must be the area of this rectangle. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its width and height. Now, let's calculate the area of each rectangle: - For 2 x 0, the area is 2 * 0 = 0. - For 2 x 2, the area is 2 * 2 = 4. - For 1 x 1, the area is 1 * 1 = 1. Since the answer choices only provide options for a single missing number in the sequence, we can infer that the correct answer is **the negative of the smallest possible area of a rectangle formed by combining these dimensions**. The smallest area would be 1 x 1, giving us an area of 1. However, there is another aspect to consider. The question mentions that when the pieces are fitted together correctly, the result is a rectangle with a calculation written on it. One interpretation could be that the calculation is related to the dimensions of the puzzle pieces themselves, rather than just the final combined shape. Given this, let's analyze the options: - A) -100 does not relate directly to any area calculation based on the given numbers. - B) -8 does not directly correlates with the area calculation of the possible rectangles. - C) -1 does not match any area calculation based on the given dimensions. - D) 199 is also unrelated to the area calculations. - E) 208 does not match any direct area calculation from the dimensions. Considering the provided dimensions and the fact that "the result is a rectangle with a calculation written on it," we should focus on how the dimensions could be rearranged or interpreted differently to fit this constraint. However, the question's setup does not necessarily align with standard geometric or arithmetic sequence meanings directly, suggesting a potential misunderstanding in its ph
