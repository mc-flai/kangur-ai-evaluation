Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of balancing numbers on a wheel. The reasoning for this answer is as follows: We first note that the numbers 49, 70, and 75 listed do not add up to 150, so it is unlikely that a combination of the numbers appearing twice will lead to a total of 150. Second, choosing the numbers that appear more than once will generally yield a higher total than one observed in the given numbers. Therefore, checking the balance numbers for the remaining combinations based on option D will lead to a validation of whether or not we were able to sum the numbers to 150. In conclusion, the leader above sent out the data on how he managed to reach 105 as he found a pattern similar to the one observed in the question above. Further investigation led him to verify his work using his designs and expressions checks of whether these sums met the requirements laid out above.

Answer: D)
