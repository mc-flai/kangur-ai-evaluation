Reasoning: To determine which of the five squares has the biggest proportion of black area, we need to calculate the ratio of black pixels to total pixels for each square.

**Square A**: The square has 4 black pixels and 6 white pixels, giving a ratio of 4:10 or 40%.

**Square B**: This square has 5 black pixels and 5 white pixels, resulting in a ratio of 5:10 or 50%.

**Square C**: With 9 black pixels and 3 white pixels, the ratio is 9:12 or 75%.

**Square D**: This square has 7 black pixels and 5 white pixels, leading to a ratio of 7:12 or approximately 58%.

**Square E**: The last square has 8 black pixels and 8 white pixels, giving a ratio of 8:16 or 50%.

Comparing these ratios, the square with the highest proportion of black area is Square C, which has a ratio of 75%.

Answer: C)
