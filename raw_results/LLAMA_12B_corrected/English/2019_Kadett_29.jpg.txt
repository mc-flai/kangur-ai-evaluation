Reasoning: To determine the fraction of the square $ABCD$ that is shaded, we need to calculate the area of the shaded region and divide it by the total area of the square. The shaded region consists of two congruent right triangles ($PQR$ and $PAS$) and a strip ($SQR$) formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides. The area of each right triangle is equal to half the product of its legs. Since the legs of both triangles are midsegments of the square, they have the same length ($\frac{1}{2}$ times the side length of the square). The area of each triangle is: $$\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}$$ The area of the strip ($SQR$) can be calculated by subtracting the area of the unshaded triangle ($QRB$) from the area of the entire square. Since $QRB$ is similar to $PAS$ and $SQR$ is three times larger, the area of $SQR$ is three times the area of $PAS$. Thus, the area of $SQR$ is $3 \times (\frac{1}{8}) = \frac{3}{8}$. The total shaded area is the sum of the areas of the two right triangles and the strip: $$\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{3}{8} = \frac{7}{8}$$ Therefore, the fraction of the square $ABCD$ that is shaded is $\frac{7}{8}$. To solve this problem, we first identified the different components of the shaded area: two congruent right triangles and a strip. We then calculated the area of each component using their respective favorable and unfavorable factors. After finding the area of all components, we successfully found the final fraction of the square that is shaded, which is $\frac{7}{8}$.
