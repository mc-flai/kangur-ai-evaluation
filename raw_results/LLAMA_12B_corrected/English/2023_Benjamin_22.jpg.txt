Reasoning: To solve question 22, we need to understand how Martin places the cards on the table and sums them. He labels the cards with a number, places them without paying attention to back or front, and then adds the visible numbers. Let's analyze the options: (A) 3 This option suggests that Martin sums only the first card. Since there are three cards, this option does not provide a way for Martin to get a different sum. (B) 5 This option implies that Martin sums only the second card. Like option (A), this does not offer a way for Martin to achieve a different sum. (C) 6 This option indicates that Martin sums only the third card. Again, this does not allow Martin to get a different sum. (D) 9 This option means that Martin sums all three cards. However, as Martin places the cards without paying attention to their sides, there are six possible card combinations: 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, and 321. Since any two pairs sum to 6 (e.g., 12+3=15, 1+32=33), (D) does not provide a way for Martin to get a different number of a sum. (E) A different amount. This option is about achieving a different total value. Considering the arrangement of cards, with two identical and one distinct card, any combination provides a distinct different amount. As stated before, any pair of the same card and another card gives a unique pair summing to 6. Therefore, Martin can indeed get a different amount using different combinations of the cards placed on the table. By examining each option in relation to the instructions and the nature of the cards, it becomes apparent that only option (E) offers a clear path for achieving a distinct sum that cannot be replicated using the With the rules given and how the cards are arranged - allowing Martin to all card combinations.
Answer: E)
