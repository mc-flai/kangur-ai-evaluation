Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between the radii of the circles and apply geometric concepts. We are given three concentric circles with radii $r$, $2r$, and $3r$ respectively. The diagram shows that the small circle has a radius of $1$. The three grey sections are of equal area, which means the areas of these sections are equal to each other and to the area of the small circle. Let's denote the area of each grey section as $A$ and the area of the small circle as $A_0$. Since the areas of the grey sections are equal, we can write: $$ A = A_0 $$ The area of a circle is given by the formula: $$ A = \pi r^2 $$ Substituting this into the equation above, we get: $$ \pi (2r)^2 = \pi r^2 $$ Simplifying, we find: $$ 4r^2 = r^2 $$ Dividing both sides by $r^2$ (assuming $r \neq 0$), we get: $$ 4 = 1 $$ This is a contradiction, as it implies that $A_0 = 0$, which means the small circle has no area. However, this contradicts the fact that the small circle has a non-zero radius ($r = 1$). This indicates an issue with the assumption that the areas of the grey sections are equal to the area of the small circle. To resolve this, let's re-analyze the situation. The three grey sections together cover the entire area outside the small circle. The area of the two larger circles (with radii $2r$ and $3r$) outside the small circle can be found by subtracting the area of the small circle from their combined area. The surrounding area outside the small circle is comprised of two overlapping segments: - Three-quarter of the circle with radius $2r$, - Three-quarter of the circle with radius $3r$. The total area is $3/4$ of each circle combined, covering exactly $1$ full circle with radius $2 \cdot 1 = 2$ minus the area of the small circle, which gives exactly the area of the circle with radius $3$ (number of grey regions shaded in diagram). This zero anomalies does not indicate a major issue ineeded under assumption given of equal area annyal Angle
