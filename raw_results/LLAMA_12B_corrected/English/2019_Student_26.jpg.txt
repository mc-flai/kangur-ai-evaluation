Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of the absolute difference between two consecutive integers, which can be calculated using the formula: |n^2 - 2n - 3|. We will examine each option to determine its validity. 

*   Option A): 1
    *   Substituting n = 1 into the equation gives |1^2 - 2(1) - 3| = |-4| = 4.
    *   However, |n^2 - 2n - 3| is not a prime number for n = 1.
    *   Hence, option A) is incorrect.
*   Option B): 2
    *   Substituting n = 2 into the equation gives |2^2 - 2(2) - 3| = |-3| = 3.
    *   Here, |n^2 - 2n - 3| is a prime number for n = 2.
    *   Therefore, option B) is a possible answer.
*   Option C): 3
    *   Substituting n = 3 into the equation gives |3^2 - 2(3) - 3| = |6| = 6.
    *   |n^2 - 2n - 3| is not a prime number for n = 3.
    *   Thus, option C) is incorrect.
*   Option D): 4
    *   Substituting n = 4 into the equation gives |4^2 - 2(4) - 3| = |11| = 11.
    *   Here, |n^2 - 2n - 3| is a prime number for n = 4.
    *   Hence, option D) is also not incorrect.
*   Option E): infinitely many
    *   Applying the same process as above to other values of n would yield additional instances of |n^2 - 2n - 3| resulting in prime numbers.
    *   This makes option E) plausible as it suggests a pattern where the absolute value expression yields prime numbers for various values of n.

All possible answers are B) and D), indicating that for numerous values of n, |n^2 - 2n - 3| outputs values that are prime numbers.
