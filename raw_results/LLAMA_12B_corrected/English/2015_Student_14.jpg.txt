Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of positive whole numbers and their relationships. Let's analyze the information given: The numbers are $a, b, c, d, e$. All the numbers are different. The following relationships hold: $b = c : e$, $d = a + b$, $a = e - d$. We can start by substituting $d$ and $e$ in terms of $a$ and $b$: Since $d = a + b$, we can express $e$ as $e = d + a$. Substituting $e$ from the second equation into the first, we get $e = (a + b) + a = 2a + b$. Now, let's examine the relationship between $b$ and $e$ more closely. Given that $a = e - d$ and $d = a + b$, we substitute the value of $d$ into the equation for $e$ to find a direct relationship between $a$ and $b$: Substituting $d = a + b$ into $e = d + a$, we get $e = (a + b) + a = 2a + b$. Notice that $b = c : e$ indicates a proportional relationship between $b$ and $c$ through some unknown constant represented by $e$. Since $a = e - d$ and $d = a + b$, we have an equation to relate $a$ and $b$: $a + b = e - a$. Simplifying, $2a + b = e$. This equation shows that $a, b,$ and $e$ are all proportional to each other. It implies a consistent relationship where their sum Production is maintained. Since these are all positive whole numbers, their values extend over a continuous spectrum of sizes, with each being 1/3 (or some constant times $b$) larger than the previous element as we move through the sequence, assuming uniform spacing from lowest to highest, $b$ would logically be later in the sequence, while $a$ would logically be early. Given these relationships and since the question asks for the numbers in ascending order, $b$ must come later in the sequence than any not starting with it, hence it meets sequence and proportional requirements and is the "lar^
