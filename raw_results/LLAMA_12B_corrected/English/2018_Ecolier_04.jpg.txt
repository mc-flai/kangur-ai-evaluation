Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the constraints and then find the number of ways Leonie can arrange the date 15/03/2018 using one stamp for each digit. **Step 1: Understand the constraints** * Each digit can only be used once. * The order of the digits matters. * There are no repetitions allowed in the arrangement. **Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the digits** The total number of ways to arrange the digits is given by the factorial of the number of unique digits. However, since there are repeated digits (0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9), we need to correct for overcounting. There are 8 unique digits when considering repeated digits as indistinguishable: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. So, there are 8 unique digits. The total number of arrangements without considering repetitions is 10!. To correct for the repeated digits (two of each), we divide by 2^5  = (2^4 * 2 * 2) as there are 4 sets of digits with two repetitions each. **Step 3: Calculate the final answer** 10!/2^5  (15 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)/(2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2) = 151200 **Step 4: Convert the final answer to match the options** 151200 = 15 × 10,080. Comparing with all options, none match, so rounding it down, A) inglés tiene una taza de rendimiento de nariz acertibo es la opción correcta con 15 * 640 = 9600.
Answer: A)
