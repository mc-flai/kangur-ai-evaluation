Reasoning: **Step 1: Understand the problem.** The problem requires finding three-digit natural numbers where if their digits are reversed, the resulting number is 99 more than the original number. **Step 2: Identify the digit arrangement pattern.** Let's denote the original three-digit number as \(\overline{ABC}\) (where A, B, and C are the hundreds, tens, and ones place digits, respectively) and the reversed number as \(\overline{CBA}\). According to the problem, \(\overline{CBA} = \overline{ABC} + 99\). **Step 3: Express the relationship between the numbers mathematically.** Mathematically, the relationship can be expressed as: \(100C + 10B + A = 100A + 10B + C + 99\). **Step 4: Solve for the conditions that must be satisfied.** Simplifying this equation gives us \(99C - 99A = 99\). After dividing everything by 99, we get \(C - A = 1\). **Step 5: Determine the possible range and restrictions of the digits.** Given the constraint \(C - A = 1\), and \(0 < A, C < 10\) (since they are digits of a three-digit number), the only possible combinations that satisfy this condition within the three-digit range are (1, 2), (2, 3), ..., (8, 9). However, considering the original number cannot exceed 999, only combinations leading to numbers starting with 1 or 2 are feasible, because if A = 9, then C = 10, which exceeds the maximum digit value. **Step 6: Analyze the answer choices with the determined pattern.** Among the given choices, we look for those fitting this pattern. Only those numbers compared to their reversals fit the bill. **Choice (B) exemplifies this pattern:** 64 reversed is 46, and 64 - 46 = 18. However, 18 is not the number we're looking for, and the discrepancy arises due to simplification and misinterpretation in step 6. **Correct Approach for Step 6:** Realizing the mistake in step 5, we should directly evaluate the options rather than deducing wrongly. Each choice is to be evaluated for similarity difference between itself and its reverse, starting digits consideration, and their sum being exactly 99.
