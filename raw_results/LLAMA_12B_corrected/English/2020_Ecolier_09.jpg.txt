Reasoning: To answer this question, we need to analyze the information provided and identify the correct option. The image shows a grid of 4x4 squares with various colored cubes placed within it. The task is to determine which of the options (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) matches the arrangement of colored cubes on the grid. The grid has 16 squares. Each square can be either filled with a cube or left empty. The cubes are colored green, red, blue, or yellow. There are no other constraints or conditions mentioned. We can start by examining each option: Option (A): This arrangement does not match the one shown in the image. Option (B): Similarly, this arrangement does not match the image. Option (C): This option also does not match the image. Option (D): Again, this arrangement does not correspond to the image. Option (E): Finally, this option matches the given image. Based on our analysis, we can conclude that the correct answer is option **(E)**.
