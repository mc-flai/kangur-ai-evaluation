Reasoning: The question asks to find the set of all numbers in the form $a + b$ with $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, where $A = ]0,1[\cup]2,3[$ and $B = ]1,2[\cup]3,4[$. From the given intervals, we can identify the possible values for $a$ and $b$. For $a$, it can be any number between 0 and 1 or between 2 and 3. For $b$, it can be any number between 1 and 2 or between 3 and 4. Now, we need to generate all possible sums $a + b$ using the identified values for $a$ and $b$. If $a \in ]0,1[$ and $b \in ]1,2[$, then $a + b \in ]1,2[$. If $a \in ]0,1[$ and $b \in ]3,4[$, then $a + b \in ]3,5[$. If $a \in ]2,3[$ and $b \in ]1,2[$, then $a + b \in ]3,4[$. If $a \in ]2,3[$ and $b \in ]3,4[$, then $a + b \in ]5,6[$. From the generated possible sums, we can see that the correct answer is the set of numbers that includes all values in the ranges ]1,2[ and ]3,5[ and ]3.4[ and ]5,6[.

Answer: A) ]1,7[
