Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of writing numbers in the circles. The numbers are written in order from 1 to 7, and then the sum of the two numbers on each side of the path is written between the two circles. We can start by writing the numbers in order from 1 to 7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Now, let's find the sum of the two numbers on each side of the path: 1 + 7 = 8, 7 + 2 = 9, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 4 = 7, 4 + 5 = 9, 5 + 6 = 11, 6 + 7 = 13. The last number written is 13, which is between the circles with numbers 6 and 7. Therefore, the correct answer is not given in the options. However, based on the given options, we can see that the closest number to the sum of the two numbers on each side of the path is 9 and 13, which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E)
