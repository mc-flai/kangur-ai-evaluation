Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of cubic numbers and how they can be constructed using smaller cubes. In the given image, there are three views of wooden cubes. We can see that the number of cubes in each view increases by a factor of 2 or 3. For example, in view (A), there are 8 cubes, which is equal to $2^3$. Similarly, in view (B), there are 27 cubes, which is equal to $3^3$. In view (C), there are 64 cubes, which is equal to $4^3$. Now, let's analyze the possible combinations of cubes that Ana's sister can form. She wants to remove all the cubes she can without modifying these three views. The only way to do this is to remove cubes from the common faces between the three views. Since the cubes are arranged in a cubic lattice, the common faces are on opposite sides of the lattice. Looking at the three views, we can count the number of cubes that share common faces. There are 4 cubes on each face that share these faces (two on each side). So, the total number of cubes that can be removed is: 4 (cubes on each face) Ã— 6 (faces) = 24 cubes. However, it's important to note that some of these cubes are part of the structure itself and cannot be removed without altering the original shape. To find out how many cubes can actually be removed, we need to subtract the overlap between the three views. To calculate the overlap, we need to find the number of cubes that are counted multiple times. From view (A), we know that the smallest unit of this structure I can have 1^(3). This means it contains a total for three cubes that make up that unit. Similarly, views (B) and (C) are counted by 3^(3) and (4^(3) respectively. Then we could subtract both figures on that diagonal, these are 1^( 3) + 3^(3) + (4^(3)) (diagonal occur more than once). For this figure these are as diagram shows the positive distances 4 (diagram trailing back). These are derived from ib442-p_00101.png.
