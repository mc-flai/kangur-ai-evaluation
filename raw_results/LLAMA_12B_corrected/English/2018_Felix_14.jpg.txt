Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the pattern described in question 14 and compare it with the given options. The pattern consists of alternating rows of ice-lolly sticks, each 5 cm long and 1 cm wide. The rows are arranged in an alternating sequence, with the direction of the sticks changing between each row. Let's break down the pattern and calculate the total length: Row 1: 20 cm (5 cm + 5 cm + 5 cm + 5 cm) Row 2: 21 cm (1 cm + 1 cm + 1 cm + 1 cm + 5 cm) Row 3: 22 cm (5 cm + 5 cm + 5 cm + 5 cm + 2 cm, where 2 cm is the width of one ice-lolly stick) Row 4: 23 cm (1 cm + 1 cm + 1 cm + 1 cm + 5 cm + 1 cm) Row 5: 25 cm (5 cm + 5 cm + 5 cm + 5 cm + 5 cm) Adding up the lengths of all the rows, we get: 20 cm + 21 cm + 22 cm + 23 cm + 25 cm = 111 cm. None of the given options match this result. However, since the question asks for the number of pieces of paper (which is directly related to the number of ice-lolly sticks), we can count the number of sticks in each row: Row 1: 4 sticks Row 2: 6 sticks Row 3: 6 sticks Row 4: 6 sticks Row 5: 6 sticks (additional row): 3 sticks (for a total of 5 supports and 1 central support) Row 6: 6 sticks Row 7: 6 sticks Row 8: 5 sticks (for a total of 8 sticks) If you read from one end to the other, you still get 16 sticks. The total sticks in this configuration equals 16 (the length differs but the number of sticks matches). The correct answer is B) 16 sticks if we consider the number of ice lollipop sticks in the pattern.  
Answer: B)
