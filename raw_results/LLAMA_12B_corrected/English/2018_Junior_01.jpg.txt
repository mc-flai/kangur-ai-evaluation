Reasoning: The question asks for the minimum number of children in the family. We need to find the smallest positive integer n such that n ≥ 3, and n ≥ 2⋅k for some k. Option (B) 4 satisfies this condition because 4 ≥ 3 and 4 ≥ 2⋅2. Option (C) 5 also satisfies this condition because 5 ≥ 3 and 5 ≥ 2⋅2. Option (E) 7 satisfies this condition because 7 ≥ 3 and 7 ≥ 2⋅3. Therefore, the smallest number of children in the family is 4.

Answer: B)
