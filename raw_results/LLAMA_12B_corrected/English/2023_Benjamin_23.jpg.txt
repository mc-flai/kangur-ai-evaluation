Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the operations of two machines: R (rotate 90 degrees in a clockwise direction) and S (rotate 90 degrees in the opposite direction). The problem presents a sequence of squares that are transformed by these machines.

**Initial Setup:**

- Arrange the squares in a single column:
  - A
  - B
  - C
  - D
  - E

**Machine R Operation:**

- R rotates 90 degrees clockwise.
- After applying R:
  - B → A (new top becomes old right)
  - D → C (new middle becomes old bottom)
  - F → E (new bottom becomes old left)

**Machine S Operation:**

- S rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise.
- After applying S:
  - B → D (new top becomes old left)
  - F → C (new middle becomes old bottom)
  - H → E (new bottom becomes old right)

**Complete Transformation:**

The complete transformation is achieved by combining machine R and S operations:
- (SRR)
  - Rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise (S)
  - Rotate 90 degrees clockwise (R)
  - Rotate 90 degrees clockwise (R)

**Final Parameters:**

After applying (SRR), the squares are arranged such that they form a circle when opened out.

**Conclusion:**

The correct option is: C) SRRS
Answer: C)
