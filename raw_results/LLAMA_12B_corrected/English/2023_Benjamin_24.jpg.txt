Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the rules and visualize the path Monika needs to take. Here's my step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand the Rules**: Monika is moving from 'Start' to 'Ziel' through a labyrinth. The rules are:
    - She can only move horizontally or vertically.
    - She must enter every white circle exactly once.
    - She cannot enter a black circle.

2. **Visualize the Path**: Given these constraints, we need to find a path that starts with 'Start', goes through all white circles (entering each one exactly once), and ends at 'Ziel'. The path should avoid any black circles.

3. **Analyze the Labyrinth**: Looking at the options provided, we need to identify which movements align with these rules and allow Monika to navigate through the labyrinth.

4. **Evaluate the Options**:
    - **(A) ↓**: This option involves moving straight down. However, since Monika must enter every white circle exactly once, a straight path down wouldn't allow her to do so since it wouldn't cover all necessary circles correctly or safely.
    - **(B) ↑**: Moving up wouldn't serve her goal either because it doesn't consider the requirement to counterclockwise enter every white circle as needed.
    - **(C) →**: Moving forward could potentially work if it allows her to make a correct, counterclockwise circuit around every white circle avoiding the black ones.
    - **(D) ←**: Moving backward isn't an option under the provided rules as it's about moving into a new white circle, not backward through an already traversed one in a safe manner.
    - **(E) there are several possibilities**: This is too vague without specifying which movements it refers to, making it unreliable without additional context.

**Conclusion**: The correct path that respects the rules (allowing narrowing down from options given their specifics in the question against the puzzle constraints equally applied) isn't directly assessable without specifying the orientation or steps which neither the question nor rationale entails necessarily, making a definitive choice based purely on the options and rationale presented seems impractical without evaluating individual specific navigations. 

However, since the general rule of thumb for such labyrinths involves traversing horizontally and vertically through white circles countingerclockwise, without loss of generality, moving along a horizontal/vertical path in the direction acceptable poses less risk than moving along the decisions inertia's offered might suggest. In reverence then

Answer: No Answer.
