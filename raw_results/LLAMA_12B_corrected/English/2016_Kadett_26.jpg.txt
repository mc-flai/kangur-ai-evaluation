**Reasoning:** To solve this question, we need to understand the given information and analyze it step by step. First, we are provided with two pieces of information: The product of the two smallest numbers is 16. The product of the two biggest numbers is 225. We are then asked to find the sum of all numbers written on the board. From the given information, we can deduce the following: Since the product of the two smallest numbers is 16, and considering that 16 can be factored into various pairs of numbers (e.g., 1 and 16, 2 and 8, 4 and 4), we can determine that the two smallest numbers are 2 and 8. Similarly, since the product of the two biggest numbers is 225, and considering that 225 can be factored into various pairs of numbers (e.g., 3 and 75, 5 and 45, 9 and 25), we can determine that the two biggest numbers are 15 and 15. Now, let's calculate the sum of all numbers written on the board: 2 + 8 + 15 + 15 = 40. However, this does not match any of the provided options. Let's reevaluate our approach: Upon reevaluation, we realize that there might have been an error in the initial analysis. The correct approach would be to find the two smallest and two largest numbers that fulfill the given product conditions and then calculate their sum. Let's assume the two smallest numbers are indeed 2 and 8, as initially analyzed, and proceed with finding the correct pair of the two biggest numbers. Given the context of the problem, it seems that the intended answer might have been overlooked due to a misunderstanding of the initial analysis. Without further calculations or clarification, we cannot accurately determine the exact sum based solely on the provided steps and initial assumptions. Therefore, the correct approach involves deducing the correct pairing of numbers for both the smallest and largest products, then calculating their sum based on those correct pairs. However, due to the initial misanalysis and lack of additional information or clear correct answer choices (A, B, C, D, E) relating directly to the sums of numbers based on the described scenario, the precise sum cannot be directly inferred from the provided steps.

**Answer:** No Answer.
