Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the cube and find the figure that is on the opposite face from the diamond. **Step 1: Identify the Diamond** First, let's identify the figure on the diamond-colored side of the cube. It's a green triangle. **Step 2: Find the Opposite Face** Next, we need to find the opposite face of the cube. Since there are only six faces on a cube, we can eliminate two options - top or bottom. The diamond is on one of the shorter edges, which means it cannot be on the top or bottom. **Step 3: Eliminate Options** We can eliminate options A and D because they show a yellow star, not a triangle. Option B shows a yellow star on the same face as the diagram on the left, so it's also incorrect. Option E shows a blue circle on the opposite face, but the question asks for the figure that is opposite to the diamond's position, not just any figure on the opposite face. **Step 4: Choose the Correct Answer** Based on the analysis above, the only option that shows a green triangle on the opposite face of the diamond-colored side is option C). 

Answer: C)
