Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to use the angle bisector theorem. The angle bisector theorem states that in a triangle, an angle bisector divides the opposite side into two segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle. In this case, we are given a right-angled triangle with an acute angle opposite the hypotenuse. We want to find the length of the angle bisector that splits the opposite side into segments of length 1 and 2. Let's denote the length of the hypotenuse as x. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can express the length of the side opposite the acute angle as sqrt(x^2 - 1) (since it is a right triangle). Applying the angle bisector theorem, we get: x / (1 + 2) = sqrt(x^2 - 1) / (x - 1). Simplifying the equation, we get: x / 3 = sqrt(x^2 - 1) / (x - 1). Cross-multiplying and squaring both sides, we get: x^2(x - 1) = 9(x^2 - 1). Expanding and rearranging the terms, we get: x^3 - x^2 = 9x^2 - 9. Rearranging again, we get: x^3 - 10x^2 + 9 = 0. This is a cubic equation. One way to solve it is by factoring: (x - 1)(x^2 - 9x + 9) = 0. This gives us two possible solutions for x: x = 1 and x = 9/2. Since the length of the hypotenuse cannot be 1 (as it would make one of the sides infinite), we discard the solution x = 1. Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse is x = 9/2. Since the length of one of the segments is 2, the length of the other segment is x - 2 = 9/2 - 2 = 5/2. Therefore, the length of the angle bisector is (1 + 2) / x = 3 / (9/2) = 6/9 = 2/3. So, the length of the angle bisector is 2/3.
