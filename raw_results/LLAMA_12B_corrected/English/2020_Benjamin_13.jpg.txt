Reasoning: To determine the number of brown kangaroos in this circle, we can use the given information from the earlier question as a reference. Each of the 2020 kangaroos either says "One of my neighbors is brown and the truth, or they are grey and only tell lies." Note that each kangaroo tells the truth or lies, but they never both do.

Let's analyze the possible scenarios for each kangaroo:

1.  If a kangaroo tells the truth, their neighbor must be brown.
2.  If a kangaroo lies, their neighbor must also be brown.

However, since there are an odd number of kangaroos (2020), there is always at least one kangaroo that cannot lie - the one in the middle.

If a kangaroo tells the truth:
   *   Its neighbor must be brown.
   *   The other neighbor (across the middle kangaroo) must be grey, as that kangaroo is also telling the truth.

If a kangaroo lies:
   *   Its neighbor must also lie.
   *   The other neighbor must be grey (as lying to the truth-telling kangaroo across the middle).

Since the minimum number of brown kangaroos needed is one, and there are 2020 kangaroos due to replication in the chain, the only logical conclusion is that:

*   All the kangaroos are brown.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: E)
