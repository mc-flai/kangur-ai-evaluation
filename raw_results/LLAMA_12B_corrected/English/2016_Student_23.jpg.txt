Reasoning: The question asks for the number of quadratic functions y = ax^2 + bx + c with a ≠ 0 that have graphs with at least three marked points. The constraints are that the quadratic function y = ax^2 + bx + c has a ≠ 0, which means the parabola is not horizontal or vertical. For a quadratic function to have at least three marked points, it must intersect the x-axis at least three times. This means the equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 has at least three distinct real roots. A quadratic equation has at least one real root. To have at least three distinct real roots, the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) must be greater than zero. Since the quadratic function has a ≠ 0, there are infinitely many possible solutions. However, since we are asked for the number of quadratic functions, we need to count the number of possible quadratic functions. The correct answer is E (no limitations), as there are infinitely many possible quadratic functions that meet the conditions.

Answer: E)
