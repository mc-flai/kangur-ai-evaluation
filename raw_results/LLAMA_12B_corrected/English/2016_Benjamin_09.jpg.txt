Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the situation depicted in the image. The question is asking us to decide which side of the table should be facing up when placing a box on it. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the thought process: 1. The table has four sides labeled A, B, C, and D. 2. We are asked to choose the side that should be facing up when placing the box on the table. 3. The correct side would depend on the orientation of the box when it is placed on the table. 4. Since the box is placed with its opening on top, the side facing up would be the one opposite to the opening. 5. In this case, since the box is placed with its opening facing the top, the correct side facing the top would be side C. 

Answer: C
