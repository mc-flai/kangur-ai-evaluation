Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the relationship between the points and the length of AE. From the description, we know that AB is parallel to the sides of the rectangle and has lengths of 30 m and 24 m. We also know that CD parts of this fence and has lengths of 30 m, 24 m, and 10 m. The owners of these lands have combined to knock down the fence and make a new straight AE fence, without changing the area of each of the lands. The area of one land is 30 x 10 = 300 m^2. The total area of both lands is 2 x 300 = 600 m^2. Since the owners of the lands have combined to knock down the fence and make a new straight AE fence, without changing the area of each of the lands, the area of the land with points A and B is still 300 m^2. To find the length of AE, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. We know the area is 300 m^2, and the width (length of AB) is 30 m. Let's denote the length of AE as x. 300 = 30x. To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 30: x = 300 / 30, x = 10. So, the length of AE is 10 m. Now, let's evaluate the options: (A) 8 m: This is less than the length of AE, which is 10 m. (B) 10 m: This is equal to the length of AE. (C) 12 m: This is greater than the length of AE. (D) 14 m: This is also greater than the length of AE. (E) 16 m: This is even further away from the correct length of AE. Therefore, the correct answer is B) 10 m.

Answer: B)
