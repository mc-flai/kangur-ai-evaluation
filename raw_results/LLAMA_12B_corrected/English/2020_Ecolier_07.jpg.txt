Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the patterns and try to replicate them using different colored shapes. Each pattern provided in the options involves using multiple colors and shapes to achieve a specific design.

The following are the possible relationships between the shapes:

*   **Option A:** There are 20 shapes in total, 2+2+2+2+2=10 squares, 2+2+2=6 triangles, and 2+2+2=6 pentagons.
*   **Option B:** There are also 20 shapes in total, with 10 squares and 10 triangles.
*   **Option C:** The pattern is made up of a total of 18 shapes, with 8 pentagons and 10 hexagons.
*   **Option D:** There are 16 shapes in total, consisting of 8 triangles and 8 squares.
*   **Option E:** The pattern consists of 10 squares, 3 triangles, and 3 pentagons for a total of 16 shapes.
*   **Option F:** This pattern is irregular since it features different shapes and colors. If each rectangle is counted as 4 unique shapes and the gray color appearing once again in an irregular pattern, the pattern in option F would disregard counting full and partial rows and simply give it a value of 'F'.
*   **Answer**: The correct answer is **Option A** (2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
