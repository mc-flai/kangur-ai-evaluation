Reasoning: To determine if a quadrilateral is convex, we must check whether all its internal angles are less than 180 degrees. A convex quadrilateral has no more than two right angles. For any convex quadrilateral, the sum of the internal angles is always 360 degrees. Option A is incorrect because a polygon cannot have more than two right angles. Option C contains three right angles, making it an incorrect answer. Option B (0, 1, 2, 4) and Option E (1, 2, 3) are both correct. The correct answer is Option B (0, 1, 2, 4) and Option E (1, 2, 3).
Answer: No Answer.
