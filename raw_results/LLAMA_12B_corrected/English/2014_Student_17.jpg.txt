Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the problem and choose the correct answer from the given options. The problem is asking us to calculate the amount of water in a soft cheese based on its packaging and fat content. On the packaging of a soft cheese, it says that the total amount of fat is 24%, while also stating that 64% of the dry substance is fat. We are given four options (A), (B), (C), and (D) as the percentage of water in the soft cheese. Let's first calculate the percentage of fat in the dry substance: Let x be the percentage of fat in the dry substance. We know that 64% of the dry substance is fat, so we can set up the equation: 0.64 = 24% / 100%. Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.64 = 0.24. Now, let's find the percentage of fat in the dry substance: % fat in dry substance = (0.64 / 0.24) × 100% ≈ 266.67%. Now, let's calculate the percentage of water in the soft cheese: % water = (100% - % fat) / % fat × 100%. Substituting the values, we get: % water = (100% - 266.67%) / 266.67% × 100% ≈ 62.52%. Rounding off to two decimal places, we get: % water ≈ 62.5%. Comparing our calculated value with the given options, we can see that option (B) 62·5% is the closest match. Therefore, the correct answer is **(B)**.
Answer: B)
