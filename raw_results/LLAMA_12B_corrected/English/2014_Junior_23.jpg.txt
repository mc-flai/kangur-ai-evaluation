Reasoning: The question asks to find the minimum number of lines needed to join two points at a time for the same number of other marked points. The diagram shows seven marked points. To connect each set of two points, we can use the formula for combinations: Number of combinations = n(n-1)/2 where n is the number of points. For this case, n = 7, so the number of combinations = 7(6)/2 = 21. Based on the calculation, the minimum number of lines required is 21.
