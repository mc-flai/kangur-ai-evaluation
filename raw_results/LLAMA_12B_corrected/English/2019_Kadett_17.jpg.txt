Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to use the concept of multiples and divisors. There are 24 animals in total. One eighth of the animals are dogs. Three quarters of the animals are not cows. Two thirds are not cats. Let's find out how many kangaroos there are: Since one eighth of the animals are dogs, the number of dogs is 24 / 8 = 3. This means there are 24 - 3 = 21 animals left. Three quarters of the animals are not cows, so the number of cows is 21 * 1/4 = 5.25. Since we can't have a fraction of an animal, this means there are 5 cows. Now, we have 21 - 5 = 16 animals left. Two thirds of the animals are not cats, so the number of cats is 16 * 1/3 = 5.33. Again, we can't have a fraction of an animal, so this means there are 5 cats. Finally, we subtract the number of cows and cats from the total number of animals: 24 - 5 - 5 = 14.
