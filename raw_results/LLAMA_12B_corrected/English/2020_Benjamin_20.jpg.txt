Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the image and understand what is being asked. The problem states that Maria puts 4 liters of water in vase I, 3 liters of water in vase II, and 4 liters of water in vase III. The question is asking us to represent the three vases with the same size using the given images. Let's break down the information: Vase I has 4 liters of water. Vase II has 3 liters of water. Vase III has 4 liters of water. The images provided show different ways to represent the vases with the same size. We need to find the image that correctly represents the volumes of water in each vase. Looking at the images, we can see that: Option A represents the vases with the same height, but the width of the vases is not proportional to their volumes. Option B represents the vases with the same height and width, but the middle vase (II) has a smaller volume than the other two vases. Option C represents the vases with the same height, but the width of the vases is not proportional to their volumes. Option D represents the vases with the same height and width, but the middle vase (II) has a larger volume than the other two vases. Option E represents the vases with the same height and width, but the top vase (I) has a larger volume than the other two vases. Based on the analysis, only option B correctly represents the volumes of water in each vase. The vase with 4 liters of water (I and III) has the same height as the vase with 3 liters of water (II), and the middle vase (II) is smaller than the other two vases. 

Answer: B)
