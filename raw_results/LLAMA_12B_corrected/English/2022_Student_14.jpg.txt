Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the given information and apply geometric principles. The problem involves a big square being split into two squares and two rectangles. We are told that the vertices of the shaded quadrilateral with an area of 3 are the midpoints of the sides of the smaller squares. The big square is split into two squares and two rectangles. The vertices of the shaded quadrilateral have an area of 3. These vertices are the midpoints of the sides of the smaller squares. Let's draw a diagram to visualize the situation. The big square can be represented as follows:

```
+----------+----------+
|          |          |
|          |          |
|  Square  |  Square  |
|          |          |
|          |          |
+----------+----------+
```

The two smaller squares will have the same area since they were split from the big square. The two rectangles formed are also the same size because they are constructed using the midpoints of the sides of the smaller squares. The vertices of the shaded quadrilateral divide the sides of the smaller squares in half. This creates right-angled triangles within the quadrilateral. Each of these right-angled triangles has its base equal to half the length of a side of one of the smaller squares and its height equal to half the length of a side of the other smaller square. Since the area of the quadrilateral is given as 3, we can calculate the area of one right-angled triangle by dividing the total area by 4 (as there are 4 such triangles):

```
Area_of_one_right_triangle = 3/4

Now, let's calculate the area of this right-angled triangle:

```
Area_of_one_right_triangle = \frac{1}{2} \times base \times height = \frac{1}{2} \times (0.5 \times side_of_big_square) \times (0.5 \times side_of_big_square) = \frac{1}{8} \times side_of_big_square
```
