Reasoning: The question asks for the number that Riki should write in a specific zone of the diagram. To determine which number, we need to examine the arrangement of numbers in the already-placed zones and find the pattern or rule followed by Riki. The diagram has numbers in two zones: zone A has the number 1, zone B has the number -2, zone C has the number 6, zone D has the number -4, and zone E is empty. We can observe a pattern in these zones: Zone A: Positive number, Zone B: Negative number, Zone C: Positive number, Zone D: Negative number. This pattern suggests that each zone alternates between positive and negative numbers. Since we are looking for the number in zone marked "?", we need to determine which zone it corresponds to. Zone A is the first zone with a positive number. Zone B is the second zone with a negative number. Zone C is the third zone with a positive number. Zone D is the fourth zone with a negative number. Zone E would be the fifth zone, and given the pattern, it should be a positive number. Based on the pattern observed in zones A-D, the next zone (zone E) should have a positive number. Among the given options, only one number is positive: 4.

Answer: E)
