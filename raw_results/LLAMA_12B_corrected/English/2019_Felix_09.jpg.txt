Reasoning: To solve question 9, we need to analyze the movement restrictions of the mouse and the cheese's position within the farm. The mouse is prohibited from moving to neighboring fields in the direction of the arrows. The cheese is located in a different field from the last known position of the mouse. The mouse must navigate through at least 2 fields to reach the cheese. We consider paths (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) in order to determine the number of paths available to the mouse. We evaluate the direction of movement required for each path based on the restrictions imposed by the arrows and the relative positions of the mouse and the cheese. We rule out paths that violate the given restrictions. Upon careful consideration of the possible paths and excluding those that violate the movement restrictions, we identify that only paths (A) and (B) comply with the rules, allowing for legal movement between fields. Therefore, the number of legal paths is 2.
Answer: B) 2
