Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to analyze the diagram and find the pattern that matches the given instruction. The instruction states that the sheets on top of each other should be placed in a specific order.

Looking at the options A) to E), we can see that only option C) shows both sheets in the correct order:

   - The first sheet has a dog pointing to the right.
   - The second sheet has a dog pointing to the left.

This means that the dog should go through the black line in the first sheet and then in the second sheet, which matches the instruction. Therefore, the correct answer is option C).
Answer: C)
