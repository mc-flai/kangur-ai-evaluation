Reasoning: To find the answer, we need to identify the numbers that sum up to 770 when their squares are calculated. Given that the sum of the squares of three consecutive positive whole numbers is 770, let's denote the numbers as x, x+1, and x+2. The squares of these numbers are x^2, (x+1)^2, and (x+2)^2. We know that the sum of these squares is 770, so we can set up the equation: x^2 + (x+1)^2 + (x+2)^2 = 770. Expanding the equation, we get: x^2 + x^2 + 2x + 1 + x^2 + 4x + 4 = 770. Combining like terms, we get: 3x^2 + 6x + 5 = 770. Subtracting 770 from both sides gives us: 3x^2 + 6x - 765 = 0. Dividing by 3, we get: x^2 + 2x - 255 = 0. Now, we can factor the quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula to solve for x. Factoring, we get: (x + 17)(x - 15) = 0. This gives us two possible values for x: x = -17 or x = 15. Since x must be a positive whole number, we discard x = -17. Therefore, x = 15. So, the three consecutive positive whole numbers are 15, 16, and 17. The correct answer is C) 17.
