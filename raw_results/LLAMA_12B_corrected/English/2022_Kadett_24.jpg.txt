Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of the distance formula and how it relates to the different options. The distance formula is:

$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$

Given Information

* Distance = 48 km
* Speed = 48 km / 60 minutes = 0.8 km/min
* Time = 60 minutes

Possible Choices and Explanations

* **(A) 75 km**
	+ The distance formula would give us an answer greater than 48 km, which is incorrect.
* **(B) 50 km**
	+ The distance formula would also give us an answer greater than 48 km, which is incorrect.
* **(C) 80 km**
	+ Using the distance formula, we get a distance of 80 km, which matches the answer.
* **(D) 100 km**
	+ The distance formula would give us an answer greater than 48 km, which is incorrect.
* **(E) 140 km**
	+ This choice is not relevant to the answer.

To get the correct answer, we had to apply the concept of the distance formula and compare the results with each option.

Answer: C)
