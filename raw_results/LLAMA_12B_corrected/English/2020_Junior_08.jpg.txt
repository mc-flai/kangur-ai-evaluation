Reasoning: **Step 1: Understand the problem** The question asks about the perimeter of a figure formed by nine squares of $1 \text{ cm} \times 1 \text{ cm}$ each, with one square arranged beside the others to form the largest perimeter. **Step 2: Identify the possible arrangements** The squares can be arranged in various ways to maximize the perimeter. The goal is to determine which arrangement results in the largest perimeter. **Step 3: Consider each arrangement option** - **Option A)**: This option displays a rectangular arrangement with dimensions $3 \times 3$. The perimeter would be $3 \times (1 + 1 + 3 + 3) = 18 \text{ cm}$. - **Option B)**: This option shows a domino-shaped arrangement. To calculate the perimeter, add the side lengths together: $4 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 18 \text{ cm}$. - **Option C)**: This option shows a square arrangement with dimensions $4 \times 4$. The perimeter is $4 \times (1 + 1 + 4 + 4) = 20 \text{ cm}$. - **Option D)**: This option shows an L-shaped arrangement is not formed in this question, but one option shows a straight $5+4$ shape for both options. The perimeter is $5 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 18 \text{ cm}$. - **Option E)**: This option shows a diamond-shaped arrangement. To find the perimeter, add the side lengths together, $4 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 18 \text{ cm}$. **Step 4: Conclusion** After calculating the perimeters for each arrangement, we find that both **Option B**) and **Option D**), with the straight **5+4** shape configuration, True have a perimeter of **18 cm**. Lastly, Option C haviing the shape of $4 \times 4$ and one added to the sides a few, the answer is **20 cm**, all of these arrangements are in viable.
