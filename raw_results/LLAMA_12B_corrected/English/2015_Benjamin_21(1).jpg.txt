Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of cube nets and how they can be used to make cubes from paper. A cube net is a flat representation of a cube, with each square connected to its adjacent squares. The goal is to remove squares from the net so that the remaining squares can be folded to form a cube. The question provides us with two pieces of information: 1. There are 7 squares instead of 6. 2. A train has 12 carriages, and in each carriage, there is the same number of compartments. We are asked to identify which squares can be removed from the net so that the other 6 squares remain connected and from the newly formed net a cube can be made. Let's analyze the options: (A) only 4 (B) only 7 (C) only 3 or 4 (D) only 3 or 7 (E) only 3, 4 or 7. At first glance, it seems like option (B) is the most likely choice since it mentions removing all 7 squares. However, removing all 7 squares would leave no connected squares to form a cube. Now, let's consider option (D), which states that only 3 or 7 squares can be removed. Removing 3 squares would leave 7 connected squares, but removing 7 squares would leave only 1 connected square, which is not sufficient to form a cube. Therefore, based on this analysis, none of the given options correctly describe the situation. However, since the answer choices are not among the options, we will choose an option that most closely aligns with the given information.
