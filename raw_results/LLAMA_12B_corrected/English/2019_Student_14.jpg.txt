Reasoning: To determine which statements are true, we need to analyze the conditions given in the problem. The statements A, B, and C are true by the definition of the operation: **Definition:** For real numbers $x$, $y$, and $z$, if $x \diamond y = y - x$, then we have (a) $(a \diamond b) \diamond c = (b - a) - c = b - (a + c) = a \diamond (b \diamond c)$ (b) $(b \diamond c) \diamond a = (c - b) - a = c - (b + a) = b \diamond (c \diamond a)$ (c) $(c \diamond a) \diamond b = (a - c) - b = a - (c + b) = c \diamond (a \diamond b)$. However, statement D is not true because $(a \diamond a) = 0$ does not necessarily equal $(a \diamond b) + (a \diamond c)$. And statement E is also not true because the system does not invade when c is equal to zero. When we combine the results of $(a \diamond b)$ and $(a \diamond c)$, we get $a \diamond ((b + a) \diamond c)$. This shows that $a \diamond (b \diamond c)$ is indeed equal to $(a \diamond (b \diamond c))$. The statements B and C are automatically true since we have $(b \diamond c) \diamond a = (c \diamond a) \diamond b$. This condition holds for any commutative operation. And finally, since $(c \diamond a) \diamond b c = c \diamond ((a + b) \diamond a)$ from statement C, it follows that $(c \diamond a) \diamond b c = c \diamond ((a + b) \diamond (c \diamond a))$ as well. This validates the involution for all variables. Therefore, the sets of statements that are true are A), B), and C).

Answer: A), B), C)
