Reasoning: The diagram shows 16 towns connected by roads. The government is planning to build power plants in some of these towns. Each power plant can generate enough electricity for the town it's in and its immediate neighboring towns. The towns are connected via roads. Power plants can generate electricity for the town they're in and its immediate neighbors. There are 16 towns in total. To determine the minimum number of power plants required, we need to consider the connectivity of the towns. Since each power plant can generate enough electricity for the town it's in and its immediate neighbors, we should aim to cover all towns to maximize connectivity. Based on the analysis, we should choose the option that suggests building the minimum number of power plants required to cover all towns and provide electricity to each town and its immediate neighbors. Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the minimum number of power plants required is 5. This is because with 5 power plants strategically placed, we can cover all 16 towns and provide electricity to each town and its immediate neighbors.
