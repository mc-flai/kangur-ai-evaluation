Reasoning: The question asks to find the biggest remainder Maria has noted down during the divisions. The process of division involves dividing a number by another number and finding the remainder. In this case, Maria starts with the number 2015 and successively divides it by 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., until she reaches a divisor of 1000 or greater. From the instructions provided, we know that Maria performs successive divisions of the number 2015, starting from dividing it by 1 and then by each integer up to and including 1000. The goal is to determine the largest remainder she encounters throughout these divisions. To solve this, we can analyze the pattern of remainders as we perform successive divisions. Since we are looking for the largest remainder, we need to identify the sequence of divisions that results in increasing remainders. When dividing 2015 by 1, the remainder is 0, since any number divided by 1 gives 0 as the remainder. As we divide 2015 by each integer up to 1000, the remainders will increase due to subsequent divisions potentially yielding larger remainders than those from previous divisions. Considering the factorial nature of the remainders (i.e., the product of all previous divisors and their remainders), the largest possible remainder is theoretically limited by the value of the divisor minus one, due to the division algorithm's properties. This means the remainder should not exceed the divisor; hence, we look for the highest value in the sequence that fits the criteria. Given the choices provided, we aim to select the largest number among them as the potential answer, keeping in mind that all other options must result in a smaller remainder for them to be considered less likely based on the sequential increase of indicative remainders as described above. Based on the reasoning and understanding of the division process and its effect on remainders, we deduce that the correct answer is the choice representing the highest possible remainder under these conditions.
