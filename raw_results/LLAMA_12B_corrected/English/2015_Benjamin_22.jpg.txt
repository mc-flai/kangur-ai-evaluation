**Reasoning:**

To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of carrying capacity of a train and the relationship between the number of compartments and the number of carries. The problem states that the train has 12 carriages, and in each carriage, there are the same number of compartments. We are given the seating arrangement for Mike and Joanna and asked to find the number of compartments in one carriage.

Let's denote the number of compartments in one carriage as x.

Mike is sitting in the 18th compartment behind the engine, which means he is in the third carriage. Since Mike is in the 18th compartment, we can write an equation:

3x + 14 = 18

Solving for x, we get:

3x = 4
x = 1/3

This result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as it indicates that there are only 1/3 of a compartment in one carriage. We need to reconsider our approach.

Let's think about the total number of compartments and the fact that each carriage has the same number of compartments. We know that there are 12 carriages, so the total number of compartments is 12 times the number of compartments in one carriage.

We can also use the information from the given options to test our reasoning:

A) 7 compartments  
B) 8 compartments  
C) 9 compartments  
D) 10 compartments  
E) 12 compartments  

Assuming each compartment has the same capacity (i.e., one person), we can analyze the options:

* If there are 7 compartments, then the maximum number of people in one carriage would be 7.  
* If there are 8 compartments, then the maximum number of people in one carriage would be 8.  
* If there are 9 compartments, then the maximum number of people in one carriage would be 9.  
* If there are 10 compartments, then the maximum number of people in one carriage would be 10.  
* If there are 12 compartments, then the maximum number of people in one carriage would be 12.  

Considering the seating arrangement and the fact that Mike is in the 18th compartment behind the engine (which corresponds to the third carriage), we can deduce that the correct answer is option C) 9 compartments.

**Answer:** C)
