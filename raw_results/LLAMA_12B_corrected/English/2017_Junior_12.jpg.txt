Reasoning: The question asks about the number of positive whole numbers \( n \) where exactly one of the two numbers \( n \) and \( n + 20 \) has four digits. This means we are looking for numbers where adding 20 to any given number results in either a four-digit number or a two-digit number (since adding 20 to a four-digit number results in a four-digit number, and adding 20 to a two-digit number results in a three-digit number). For \( n \) to have exactly one of the two numbers \( n \) and \( n + 20 \) as a four-digit number, we need to consider when \( n + 20 \) becomes a four-digit number. When \( n \) is a three-digit number (less than 1000), \( n + 20 \) will be a four-digit number. Conversely, when \( n \) is a four-digit number (greater than or equal to 1000), \( n + 20 \) will be a five-digit number. This implies that only a specific range of values for \( n \) can satisfy the condition simultaneously: The values where \( n \) itself is a three-digit number since \( n + 20 \) becomes a four-digit number. To find the lowest three-digit number that makes \( n + 20 \) a four-digit number, we start with 980. Adding 20 to 980 gives 1000, which is a four-digit number. The highest three-digit number less than 980 is 979. Adding 20 to 979 gives 999, which is also a four-digit number. Given this logic, any \( n \) value between and including [980, 999] will meet the criteria if we include the ground that \( n \) needs to be a three-digit number itself for it to have exactly one number that is a four-digit number when +20 is added. The range from [980, 999] inclusive means that there are \( 999 - 980 + 1 = 20 \) numbers in this range. Considering the problem asks for the number of positive whole numbers meeting the criteria, all these fall directly within the options provided.
