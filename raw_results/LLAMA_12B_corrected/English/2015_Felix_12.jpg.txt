Reasoning: To determine the number of little white cubes, we can analyze the given options and use a logical approach.

Let's analyze each option:

Option A) 10: This number is too low, as each building block has five little cubes, so at least 30 building blocks would be needed (10 x 3 building blocks), which is not feasible.

Option B) 11: This number is also too low for the same reason as option A.

Option C) 12: There are six building blocks, and each has five little cubes. To find the total number of little cubes, we multiply the number of building blocks by the number of little cubes per building block: 6 x 5 = 30.

Option D) 18: This number is too high, as there are 15 little cubes (3 x 5) for the 3 missing building blocks.

Option E) 30: This number is too high, as we already know that option C is the correct answer.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is C) 12.
Answer: C)
