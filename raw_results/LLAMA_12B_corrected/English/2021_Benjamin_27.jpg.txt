**Reasoning:**

To solve this problem, we need to find the combination of large, medium, and small bottle sizes that adds up to a total of 64 deciliters of apple juice.

Let's start by listing the possible combinations:

*   3 large bottles = 63 deciliters (not enough)
*   6 large bottles = 126 deciliters (too much)
*   8 large bottles = 168 deciliters (too much)

Since 3 large bottles are not enough, let's try combining them with other sizes:

*   2 large bottles + 6 medium bottles = 84 deciliters (not enough)
*   2 large bottles + 8 medium bottles = 112 deciliters (not enough)

Now, let's try combining them with small bottles:

*   2 large bottles + 2 medium bottles + 8 small bottles = 74 deciliters (not enough)
*   2 large bottles + 4 medium bottles + 8 small bottles = 98 deciliters (not enough)

Continuing this process, we find that the combination:

*   4 large bottles + 10 medium bottles + 0 small bottles = 104 deciliters (not enough)
*   4 large bottles + 6 medium bottles + 8 small bottles = 120 deciliters (too much)

Finally, we find the correct combination:

*   2 large bottles + 0 medium bottles + 12 small bottles = 56 deciliters (not enough)
*   0 large bottles + 4 medium bottles + 16 small bottles = 96 deciliters (not enough)
*   0 large bottles + 10 medium bottles + 12 small bottles = 132 deciliters (too much)

However, there is an alternative combination that adds up to 64 deciliters:

*   136 deciliters (a combination of large, medium, and small sizes that is too much)
*   134 deciliters (a combination of large, medium, and small sizes that is too much)

This leaves us with the only feasible option:

*   140 deciliters (a combination of large, medium, and small sizes that is too much)

Since there are no more options left to explore, we can conclude that the correct answer is not one of the listed combinations.

**Answer:** No Answer
