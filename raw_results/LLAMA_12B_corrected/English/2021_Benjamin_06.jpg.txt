Reasoning: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the given situation. The question states that a measuring tape is wound around a cylinder, and we are asked to find the number that should be at the place shown by the question mark. The correct answer can be found by adding the numbers on two adjacent marks on the tape to obtain the number at the place where the cylinder is located. In this case, the numbers are 29 and 30, which add up to 59. Therefore, we were able to determine the correct answer by adding the numbers on two adjacent marks on the tape to obtain the number at the place where the cylinder is located.

Answer: C) 59
