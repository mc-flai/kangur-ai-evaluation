Reasoning: 

To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of "shorter" when comparing directions. In the given figure, an arrow pointing from one person to another means that the first person is shorter than the second.

The correct interpretation of "shorter" in a directional context is that a line pointing towards a person indicates they are shorter than the person at the arrowhead. For example, person B is shorter than person A because the line points towards B (indicated by the arrowhead on A).

With this understanding, let's examine the options:

(A) Person A is shorter than person B.  
(B) Person B is shorter than person C.  
(C) Person C is shorter than person D.  
(D) Person D is shorter than person E.  
(E) Person E is shorter than person F.  

Given the direction of the arrows, the correct answer would be:

*   A line points from A to B, indicating B is shorter than A.  
*   A line points from B to C, indicating C is shorter than B.  
*   A line points from C to D, indicating D is shorter than C.  
*   A line points from D to E, indicating E is shorter than D.  
*   A line points from F to E, similarly indicating F is shorter than E.
