**Reasoning**: To determine which cake belongs to Sophie, we need to analyze the information provided in the image. The image shows five birthday cakes with candles, each labeled with a number. According to the text, Lea is two years older than Josef, but one year younger than Ali, and Vittorio is the youngest. Based on the information provided, Sophie's cake should have the age 7, as Vittorio is the youngest and Lea is one year older than Ali, who is two years older than Josef. Since the number on top of Cake B matches Sophie's age, the correct answer is: Vittorio is the youngest, and Sophie is two years old.
