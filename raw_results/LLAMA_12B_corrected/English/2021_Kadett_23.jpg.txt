Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the structure of a triangular pyramid and how it relates to the labeling of the cannon balls. Each face of the pyramid is a triangle with three cannon balls on each side, labeled alphabetically from A to E.

The question asks for the label on a hidden cannon ball in the middle of the fourth face. To determine this, we can use the fact that the numbers on each face are obtained by multiplying the labels on the sides of that face:

Face 1: A x B x C = (A * B * C) / 2  
Face 2: B x C x D = (B * C * D) / 2  
Face 3: C x D x E = (C * D * E) / 2  
Face 4: D x E x A = (D * E * A) / 2  

Since the numbers are given as 6-digit multiples of 3 (2ABCDE), we can deduce that A = 2, B = ABC, C = C, D = DE, and E = A. This means that the number corresponding to the fourth face is (A * E * B) = (2 * A * ABC).

Now, we need to find values of B, C, D, and E such that (B * C * D) is also a 6-digit multiple of 3 and that A is a factor of both (B * C * D) and (A * E * B). This leads us to conclude that A = 6, B = 3, C = A, D = 2, and E = B.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
