Reasoning: To determine the number of different sizes that can be obtained by drawing squares with 4 points, we need to consider all possible combinations of side lengths that can be formed using 4 points. Two different side lengths are possible: The first is a side between two adjacent points, with a length of 1 unit. The second is a diagonal between two opposite points, with a length of $\sqrt{2}$ units. Since $\sqrt{2}$ is equal to 2 times $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, we can replace $\sqrt{2}$ with 2 times $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Replacing $\sqrt{2}$ with 2 times $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ gives us: $2\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)=\sqrt{2}$. This allows us to express the second side length in terms of integers, making it easier to understand geometrically. The possibility of drawing 1 unit and 2 unit side lengths means that we can create an array with different numbers of side lengths when combining the two. Specifically, we can create arrays with sized $\{(1,2)\}$ or $\{(2,2)\}$. Therefore, only $\boxed{2}$ different sizes can be achieved. We can achieve $\boxed{2}$ distinct sizes using this method.
