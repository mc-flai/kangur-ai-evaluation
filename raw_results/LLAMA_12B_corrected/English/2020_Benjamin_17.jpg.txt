Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of undeformable pieces of wire and their ability to form a closed piece without crosses. An undeformable piece of wire refers to a shape where two or more pieces of wire join together at their ends without overlapping or intersecting each other. This means that if you were to cut along the edges of the wire, it would fall into the original shape without any gaps or tears. Options A: Two connected squares with a straight line connecting them. Option B: Two connected squares with a curved line connecting them. Option C: Two connected rectangles with a straight line connecting them. Option D: Two connected rectangles with a curved line connecting them. Option E: Two connected triangles with a straight line connecting them. Options B, D, and E can be deformed into different shapes, so they do not satisfy the condition of being undeformable. Options A and C can form a closed piece without crosses, making them undeformable options. Both of these options satisfy the given conditions.
