Reasoning: To determine which crossing Peter does not reach, we must analyze each option. He starts at point S and rides in the direction of the arrow. Point S is at the bottom left of the circle. Peter will move to the opposite side of the circle in each cross section. After completing a circle, he will be back at point S. At the first crossing he turns right, then at the next left, and then again to the right and then again to left. First, he turns right, heading to the top right quadrant. Then, he turns left, heading to the top left quadrant. Next, he turns right, heading to the bottom right quadrant. Finally, he turns left, heading to the bottom left quadrant. Which crossing does he not reach? According to the previous steps, he crosses the first four sections. The fifth section is not reached. The correct answer is "E).
