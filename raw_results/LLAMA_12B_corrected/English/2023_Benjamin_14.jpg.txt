Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of “big” in the context of addition. Here are a few steps to do that:

1.  **Looking for Patterns**: We are adding two numbers, focusing on whether the sums are equal or not. An easy way to streamline the problem is to sort out both the numbers and the sums first, see if there are any patterns or symmetries.

2.  **Analyzing the Options**:
    **A**: **(1, 11)** and **(5, 13)** give sums **12** and **18** respectively. After swapping, we get **(11, 1)** and **(13, 5)** giving sums of **12** and **18** respectively. No difference.

    **B**: **(2, 8)** and **(4, 13)** give sums **10** and **17** respectively. After swapping, we get **(8, 2)** and **(13, 4)** giving sums **10** and **17** respectively. No difference.

    **C**: **(3, 7)** and **(6, 11)** give sums **10** and **17** respectively. After swapping, we get  **(7, 3)** and **(11, 6)** giving sums **10** and **17** respectively. No difference.

    **D**: **(4, 6)** and **(8, 11)** give sums **10** and **19** respectively. After swapping, we get **(6, 4)** and **(11, 8)** giving sums **10** and **19** respectively. No difference.

    **E**: **(7, 13)** and **(1, 11)** give sums **20** and **12** respectively. After swapping, we get **(13 7)** and **(11, 1)** giving sums **13** and **11** which are not equal.

Based on this, our answer is **(E)**.  
Answer: E)
