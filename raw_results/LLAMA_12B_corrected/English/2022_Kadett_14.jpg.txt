Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of dice numbers and how they relate to perfect squares. The provided image shows a typical die with numbers 1-6 on each face. The numbers on opposite sides of the die always add up to 7. When placed together, all numbers can be seen on the outside of the solid. We need to find the minimum of four numbers between 10 and 30 that have only odd digits. Without loss of generality, let's assume that the minimum number is 11. If the minimum number is 11, then the next three numbers must be as close together as possible while still being distinct. The smallest odd digit is 3, so we can try 13, 15, and 17. However, these numbers do not add up to 7. Let's try again with the next smallest odd digit, which is 5. So, we can try 15, 17, and 19. These numbers add up to 51, which is not between 10 and 30. We continue this process until we find four numbers within the required range that meet the conditions. After trial and error, we find that 11, 13, 15, and 17 meet the conditions.
