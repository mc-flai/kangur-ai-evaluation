Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the pattern of hexagons and how the numbers are distributed in them. The diagram shows a pattern of hexagons with numbers on each side. The numbers from 1 to 11 are written in the empty hexagons, with the sums of the three numbers in each hexagon being equal. The common bold point represents the sum of the three numbers in each hexagon. Looking at the first row of hexagons, we can see that the numbers are increasing by one each time. This means that the sum of the three numbers in each hexagon is also increasing. To find the next number that can be written in the hexagon with the question mark, we need to continue the pattern. The next number would be the sum of the current number plus one, which is 12. Therefore, the correct answer is **D) 12**. This is because the pattern of increasing numbers and equal sums of three numbers in each hexagon suggests that the next number in the sequence should be 12. R = Probability that the events are independent. It is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the number of possible outcomes. It is a number between zero and one.

Answer: D) 12
