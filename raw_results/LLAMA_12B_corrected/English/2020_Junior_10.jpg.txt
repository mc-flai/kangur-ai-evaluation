Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of geometric shapes and their properties. Specifically, we should recognize the type of shape and use properties related to that shape.

The given information states that "Martinho made a bicolor kite with six pieces of a thin strip of bamboo. Two pieces were used for the diagonals, which are perpendicular. The other four pieces were used to connect the middle points on the sides of the kite, as shown in the picture."

Here, two critical concepts come into play:

1. **Properties of a kite**: A kite is a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal in length. In this case, the kite is bicolor, meaning it has two colors.

2. **Perpendicular diagonals**: The diagonals of a kite, unlike a square, are not necessarily perpendicular. However, they do intersect at right angles.

3. **Connect the middle points on the sides of the kite**: Connecting the midpoints of the sides creates smaller triangles within the kite.

Given these properties and using the provided diagram:

*   We know that if $AB = BC = CD = DE$ (since the kite has two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal), and these are perpendicular to each other, we might initially think to divvy everything evenly. But this doesn't work because the points B and E are on opposite sides.
*   Since the middle points of the kite's sides create smaller triangles, the connection between point B and any point E also forms an isosceles triangle.
*   From the diagram, it appears that when you draw a perpendicular from point F (the point where the diagonals intersect) to the side CE or AB, you create two right-angled triangles with the bases CE and AB, and the height from F to these lines.

So, we are really just drawing two triangles:
*   A right-angled triangle from point F with a poly side and half the same length CE or AB.

To summarize: segmented four points creates three triangles but the last line in point F cannot go "across" segments - is a little too long. It coincides with segment BE. If poly were tetr-t-h.ex-add fix-toess, it can be âˆ€ solution:
