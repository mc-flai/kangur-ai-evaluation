Reasoning: To determine the measure of the AÔB angle in the square, we can use the properties of tangency and angle relationships in a square. Given that two circles are tangent to each other and also to two sides of the square, we know that the points of tangency form right angles where the circles touch the square. We can draw a line from point O, the center of the circle, to point A and point B. This line will bisect the AÔB angle at the midpoint of the line segment between points A and B. Let's call the midpoint of the line segment M. Since the line OM is perpendicular to the sides of the square, it forms a right angle with the line segment AB at point M. Now, let's examine the angles formed by the line OM at point M. Since the line OM is perpendicular to the sides of the square, it forms a right angle with the line segment AB at point M. Angle OMA is one of the angles formed by the line OM at point M. Since the line OM is perpendicular to the sides of the square, it forms a right angle with the line segment AB at point M. Angle OMB is another angle formed by the line OM at point M. Since the line OM is perpendicular to the sides of the square, it forms a right angle with the line segment AB at point M. Now, let's consider the angles formed by the line OM at point M. Angle OMA and Angle OMB together form a straight line, which means their sum is 180 degrees. Since Angle OMA is a right angle (90 degrees), Angle OMB must be 90 degrees as well. Now, let's move on to the AÔB angle. We can see that Angle AOB is composed of Angle OMA and Angle OMB, which are both 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the AÔB angle is 2 x.
