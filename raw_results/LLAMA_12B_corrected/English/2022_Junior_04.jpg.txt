Reasoning: To solve this question, we need to understand the problem and how the teacher folds the left side of the paper along the vertical line to the right. The teacher folds the left side along the vertical line to the right, effectively creating a mirror image of the symbols on the right side of the original paper. This means that the same number of symbols will be present on the left side as on the right side, but in reverse order. Given this information, let's analyze the options: 1. **Option A (1 symbol)**: Since one symbol is already present on the right side, after folding, there will be only one symbol on the left side as well. 2. **Option B (2 symbols)**: Similarly, since two symbols are already present on the right side, after folding, there will be two symbols on the left side as well. 3. **Option C (3 symbols)**: This option suggests that three symbols will remain on the left side after the fold. However, considering the initial setup where two symbols are on the right, the fold would only mirror these two symbols, leaving them unchanged but mirrored on the left side. This doesn't match the description provided for this scenario. 4. **Option D (4 symbols)**: This option proposes that four symbols appear on the left side. However, according to the initial setup with two symbols on the right side, the fold would mirror these two symbols, leaving them as the only symbols on the left side after the fold, which contradicts this option. 5. **Option E (5 symbols)**: This option incorrectly suggests that five symbols will appear on the left side. Based on the initial setup with two symbols on the right, the fold would mirror these two symbols, which aligns with the logic of mirroring and does not support the presence of additional unique symbols on the left side beyond the two being mirrored. Based on the logic and explanation provided, the correct **answer** is: **(A)**
