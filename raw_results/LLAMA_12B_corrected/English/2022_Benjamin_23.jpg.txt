**Reasoning:** To solve this question, we need to use the concept of complement counting. The question states that at least one of your two neighboring people wears a hat. We are asked to find the biggest number of people that do not wear a hat.

Let's break down the information:

*   There are 30 people sitting around a round table.
*   Some of them are wearing a hat.
*   Those who do not wear a hat, have to speak the truth.
*   Those who wear a hat can either speak the truth or lie.
*   They all claim: "At least one of my two neighboring people wears a hat."

We know that if someone does not wear a hat, they will speak the truth. Therefore, if someone claims that at least one of their neighboring people wears a hat, and they themselves do not wear a hat, then their claim is true.

Now, let's consider the possible scenarios:

*   If everyone wears a hat, then their claim is false.
*   If no one wears a hat, then their claim is true.
*   If some people wear hats and some do not, then their claim could be true or false depending on the combination.

However, we are given the statement that they all claim: "At least one of my two neighboring people wears a hat." This means that if someone does not wear a hat, they must claim that at least one of their neighboring people wears a hat. Therefore, we can conclude that all people who claim not to wear a hat are telling the truth.

The maximum number of people who do not wear a hat is achieved when no one wears a hat. In this case, all 30 people would claim that at least one of their neighboring people wears a hat, which would be true.

Therefore, the biggest number of people that do not wear a hat is **25**.

**Answer:** E) 25
