Reasoning: 

To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for the train to arrive given that Matilda boards it when her phone's battery is half full. We know that her phone can:

*   Last 32 hours if she phones continuously
*   Last 20 hours if she surfs the internet continuously
*   Last 80 hours if she does not use it at all

Since she boards the train with a half-full battery, she will last for half of these times, which are 16 hours for phoning, 10 hours for surfing, and 40 hours if she does not use it at all.

The train ride can take one of the following times:

A) 10 hours  
B) 12 hours  
C) 14 hours  
D) 16 hours  
E) 18 hours  

Given that she will last 16 hours without using her phone, and the answer choices include 16 hours and 18 hours, the correct answer is not among the options provided.

However, since the question asks for the answer to be given among the provided options, we must choose an answer from the given choices. 

Assuming there might have been some oversight or calculation mistake in the options provided, if we had to opt from among them, it would be reasonable to choose the closest larger option. 

Answer: No Answer
