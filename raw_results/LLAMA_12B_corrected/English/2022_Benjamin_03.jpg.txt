Reasoning: To solve question 3, we need to understand how laser beams reflect off mirrors and the properties of light that can tell us which letter would leave the picture on the right. The two-sided mirrors reflect the laser beams as shown in the small picture on the left. This tells us that the image formed by the laser beams on the right side of the mirrors is an upside-down version of the original image. Since the question asks which letter does the laser beam leave the picture on the right, we need to look at the reflections of the letters given in options A), B), C), D), and E). Option A) shows that the letter "A" is upside-down. Option B) shows that the letter "B" is also upside-down. Option C) shows that the letter "C" is not upside-down. Option D) shows that the letter "D" is upside-down. Option E) shows that the letter "E" is not upside-down. Based on this analysis, options A) and D) are the correct answers. The final answer is: **A), D)**.  
Answer: No Answer.
