Reasoning: To determine the color of the ball numbered 2021, we need to understand the pattern of color assignment to the balls. The problem states that there are five consecutive balls where there is exactly one red, one yellow, and one blue ball among them. After any red ball, the next ball is yellow. The balls numbered 2, 20, and 202 are green. Given this information, we can deduce that the pattern of colors repeats every 3 balls, as after every red ball, the next ball is yellow, then blue, and then the sequence starts over. Since the balls are numbered from 1 to 2021, we can calculate the position of the ball numbered 2021 within this sequence to determine its color. 2021 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1, indicating that the ball numbered 2021 is in the same position as the ball numbered 1 in the sequence. Therefore, it should be red. The key to solving this problem is understanding the repeating pattern of color assignment to the balls. By recognizing that the pattern of red, yellow, and blue balls repeats every three balls, and that the balls with numbers that are multiples of 3 in the 1-2021 range would be the same pattern (followed by red), we can confidently determine the color of the ball numbered 2021 without needing to count every single ball.
