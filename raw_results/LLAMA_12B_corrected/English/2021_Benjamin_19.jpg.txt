Reasoning: To solve question 19, we need to analyze the statements about Carl and Luca taking fruit from a box and determine which ones are always true. 

**Statement A:** "Carl got at least one pear." 
This is true because if Carl did not get any pears, then all he could have gotten were apples. In this case, Luca would have had the same number of apples as Carl, making the number of apples even. However, since there are only 20 apples, which is an even number, the total number of pears would be odd (20 apples + x pears = 20 + x, where x is an odd number). Therefore, statement A is always true.

**Statement B:** "Carl got as many apples as pears." 
This statement is not necessarily always true. It depends on the specific distribution of fruit in the box. For example, if there are more apples than pears, Carl might get fewer apples than pears. Therefore, statement B is not always true.

**Statement C:** "Carl got as many pears as Luca got apples." 
This statement is also not necessarily always true. Again, it depends on the distribution of fruit in the box. If Luca got fewer apples than pears, this statement would not be true. Therefore, statement C is not always true.

**Statement D:** "Carl got as many pears as Luca got apples." 
This statement is identical to statement C and is also not always true, as explained earlier.

**Statement E:** "Carl got as many apples as Luca." 
This statement is not necessarily always true. It depends on the specific distribution of fruit in the box. If Luca got a different number of apples than pears, this statement would not be true. Therefore, statement E is not always true.

Based on the analysis, the only statement that is always true is **Statement A:** "Carl got at least one pear." Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A)
