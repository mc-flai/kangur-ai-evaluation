Raonament: The bisecting bisectors of consecutive quarters of a square will always form a diagonal line that passes through the center of the square, dividing it into two equal parts. This means that the square will always be divided into two equal rectangles, one on each side of the diagonal line. This is a unique property of squares, and it guarantees that the square is a quadrature.

Resposta: D) A rectangle.
