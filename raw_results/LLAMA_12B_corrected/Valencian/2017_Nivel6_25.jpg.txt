* A question in Spanish (not fully translated) asking about 3 rectangles that intersect at a point $P$, with the condition that various equilateral triangles can be drawn such that one of its vertices is at point $P$ and the other two vertices on the other rectangles.
* 5 possible answer choices (A, B, C, D, E) are given.
* The question does not provide any additional information or visual aids.
* To provide a correct answer, one needs to analyze the geometrical constraints and properties of the equilateral triangles and the rectangles. 
## Step 1
The question describes a scenario with three rectangles, where certain equilateral triangles can be formed such that one vertex of the triangle is at point $P$, and the other two vertices are on the other rectangles. We are asked to determine how many of these special triangles exist.

## Step 2
The key aspect of the problem is understanding what makes a triangle special in this context. An equilateral triangle has all three sides of equal length and all three angles of 60 degrees. Since one vertex of the triangle must be at point $P$, the segments from point $P$ to the vertices on the other rectangles must be equal.

## Step 3
It is important to recognize that there can be multiple combinations of these rectangles and the special equilateral triangles. However, the question asks for how many such special triangles exist.

## Step 4
Each given rectangle can contribute to one special triangle when combined with two other rectangles, given the conditions of forming an equilateral triangle. Thus, the issue becomes how many unique combinations of three rectangles can be formed.

## Step 5
Considering the rectangles as the starting points, any three of them can be chosen to form a special triangle, as each can be combined in any way with two other rectangles to meet the equilateral condition.

## Step 6
Given three rectangles, it is logical to deduce that they can give rise to a number of combinations that directly correlates with how many rectangles are present.

## Step 7
Since there are three rectangles, when selecting any two to form a line segment at point $P$ for one vertex of the triangle, the inherent property of equilateral triangles suggests that one specific rectangle, as the third to be connected (due to the nature of point $P$ being at its vertex), should work for all possible combinations except configurations where it would not allow for more degenerate cases (i.e., without broad assumptions.
