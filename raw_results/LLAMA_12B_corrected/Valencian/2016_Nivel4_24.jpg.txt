Raonament: The information in the image is: Maria has three collections: white, blue, and green blankets. She had 36 blankets initially. 25 blankets were color white. 28 blankets were color blue. 20 blankets were color green. Some blankets have two of the three colors. 5 blankets have all three colors. Maria wants to know how many blankets she can paint in a single color. The options for the answer are: A) 4, B) 12, C) 31, D) None of the above. The question asks to choose the correct answer from the given options. To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We start by adding up the number of blankets for each color individually. However, we need to subtract the number of blankets that have more than one color to avoid double-counting. We then add back the number of blankets that have all three colors to correct for the over-subtraction. The formula for this calculation is total = white + blue + green - (white_and_blue + white_and_green + blue_and_green) + all_three. Using the information given: Total number of blankets is 36. White blankets: 25. Blue blankets: 28. Green blankets: 20. White and blue blankets: Not provided. White and green blankets: Not provided. Blue and green blankets: Not provided. All three colors: 5. We can start by substituting the known values into the formula: 36 = 25 + 28 + 20 - (white_and_blue + white_and_green + blue_and_green) + 5. Simplifying this, we get: 36 = 73 - (white_and_blue + white_and_green + blue_and_green) + 5. Now, let's address the absence of specific numbers for whiteanine blue, whiteanine green, and blueanineine green, which vary due to the statement that the question does not specify this information. Considering only the information given directly: White and blue: Not possible to calculate without additional information. White and green: Not possible to calculate without additional information. Blue and green: Not possible to calculate without additional information. The question hints at needing other colors to paint the blankets and implies the query is related to painting, potentially regarding how many of the rainbow/blue/yellow/red colors she can nothisye have for a single color each mechanism When
