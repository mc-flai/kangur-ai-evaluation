Raonament: The information in the image is: Aitana is travelling from Iaio to La Barca via Pesen. The time taken for the journey from Iaio to Pesen is 40 minutes. The time taken for the journey from Pesen to La Barca passed a certain river is 90 minutes. The river flows against the journey from Pesen to La Barca, so it takes 3 minutes longer to cross the river. There is an airport at La Barca that no plane can take off from if there are more than 120 passengers on the plane. The goal is to find the minimum time that Aitana will take to travel from Iaio to La Barca, taking into account the 3-minute delay due to the river crossing and the 120-passenger limit at the airport. To determine the minimum time Aitana will take to travel from Iaio to La Barca, we should consider the total travel time, including the river crossing. The total travel time includes the time from Iaio to Pesen, and the time from Pesen to La Barca. The river crossing adds an additional 3 minutes. If there are a maximum of 120 passengers, then it is likely that route time increase as more passengers board. With that in mind, consider option E, "És impossible", which is a possible answer if total travel time plus the additional river crossing exceeds the departure time before minimal numbers of passengers can board. Without knowing specific information about the boarding rate, we cannot easily calculate minimum travel time. In other words, option E) "És impossible" seems to be the solution. There may be additional information that we can calculate the minimal time from option A, B, C, or D) but no specific information about options other than the statement not possible if departure time restriction. Consider answer option E. E és probablement el millor constructe donat codis de barrera de time i límits de tipus imatges i passatger.
