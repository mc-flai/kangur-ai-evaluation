Raonament: The question 4 is shown in the image and reads: Here is the translation of the question to English: Exactly how many times, with thickness, can you use your sense of height to decide among the options to stay transformable? Let's analyze the question. This is a trick or logical reasoning question. All you have to do is choose an answer between 4 options. Here is my reasoning: I understand that there is a sense of height in each drawing. Using your view sense, I see that all 4 drawings B-C-D are transformable if they were drawn higher. Therefore, I choose options C), D) or E) as the correct answer, since the 3 remaining drawings are almost similar which means that they are all transformative and only differ by shape and angle styles that were used.

Resposta: No Answer.
