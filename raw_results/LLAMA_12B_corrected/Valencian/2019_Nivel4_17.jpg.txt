Raonament: The information in the question is:

* Liam has $50(1+0.04)^1 + ... + $50(1+0.04)^17$ invested with a 4% daily interest rate for a period of 17 days.
* He plans to buy a car every 40 days and 10 months from now.
* The initial down payment for the car is 40% of the purchase price.
* The remaining amount is financed by selling the leftover dineros invertits.
* The question asks how many quarts diners acaba Liam la jornada (i.e., how much money will Liam have left at the end of the period).
* The options for the answer are:
	+ A) 70€
	+ B) 75€
	+ C) 80€
	+ D) 90€
	+ E) 100€ 
First, let's calculate how much Liam will have after investing for 17 days at a 4% daily interest rate. The initial amount is 50 €.
For each day, the amount will increase by 4% of the current amount.
However, there's no need to calculate the amount every day. We want to calculate the amount at the end of the 17th day.
One way to calculate this is to use the compound interest formula. However, for this case, given the choices for the answer and the number of days involved, it's more practical to calculate the total amount earned over 17 days and add it to the initial amount.
Let's calculate the total daily increase for 17 days. The formula to calculate the future value is \(FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n\), but in this case, n is 17 and we want the difference between the amounts, – not the actual amount in the end.
Fast calculation: If 50 euros grows by 4% each day, on the 17th day it will be \(50 \times 1.04^{17}\), but that's already very far in excess of our choices, and we ignore it for now.
Now we check if the conditions of buying the car are met. He buys a car in 40-10=30 days. That means he need be invested for 30-17 days either with the initial 50 euros and recovering to
