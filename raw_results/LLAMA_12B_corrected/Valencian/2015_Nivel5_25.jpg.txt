Raonament: To solve this problem, we first calculate the area of the rectangle, which is given as $900$. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula $Area = Length \times Width$. In this case, the area is $900$ and one side is $36$, so we can rearrange the formula to find the length of the other side: $900 = 25 \times Width$, which gives us $Width = \frac{900}{25} = 36$. However, this calculation seems incorrect because we already assumed $BC = 25$. Instead, we should use the correct length given, which is 25, and calculate the width using the area $900$. Given $ABCD$ is a rectangle, we know that its sides are perpendicular, and its diagonals bisect each other and are equal in length. The main diagonal $AC$ can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem $AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2$, where $AB = 36$ and $BC = 25$. Therefore, $AC^2 = 36^2 + 25^2$. Substituting the values into the formula yields $AC^2 = 1296 + 625 = 1921$. Therefore, $AC = \sqrt{1921} \approx 43.7$. We are given the answer choices as A) 60, B) 61, C) 64, D) 70, E) 72 quadrats. Since the length of $AC$ is approximately 43.7 quadrats, none of these directly matches our calculation. However, assuming standard deviation or a specific rounding, let's estimate.
