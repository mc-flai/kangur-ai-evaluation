Raonament: The problem asks us to consider the number A which is a very long sequence of 9's, repeated 2017 times. The question is to find the sum of the squares of the digits of $A^2$. First, let's consider $A^2$. When a sequence of 9's is squared, it will multiply 9 times 9, resulting in a 81. So, the squared form of the number $A$ is simply a long sequence of 81's, repeated 2016 times and followed by an 81 squared (which is 1). Then, we need to find the sum of the squares of the digits of $A^2$, which are long sequences of 1's and 9's (as 81 squared is 1). If we ignore the trailing 81, the last digit of the squared number is 1. If we ignore the multiplying 81 (which we can do since 1 squared is 1), the other digits are 9's. Each 9 squared is 81. So, the question asks how many 81s there can be. Each time there is an 81 somewhere in $A^{2}$, we can assume that the following digit can be ignored since each digit is repeated infinitely (once for each digit in the number squared), and since 1 squared is 1, ignoring these has no impact on our final answer. There are 2017 digits in A and when squared they will produce some repeating pattern of 81 and 1s. When dealing with squares and power, each 9 outcome summed over 2017 different squares exists likewise the 9 number of times A differed amongst.
