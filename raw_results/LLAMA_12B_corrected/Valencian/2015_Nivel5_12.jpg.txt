Raonament: The image presents a question in Spanish, which translates to: "For Anna to buy 3 types of pomes (specifically, pomoa) from the market, Dilluns (Monday) tore al mercat al s'adona que el preu de les pomes i dels plàtans és el mateix que el del dia d'abans i compra mig quilo de pomes menys i un quilo de plàtans més. No se'n pot dir res. Based on the provided information, we can infer that Anna buys: * Half a kilo fewer pomes (specifically, pomoa) than the previous day, as indicated by "Dilluns (Monday) tore al mercat al s'adona que el preu de les pomes..." * And one kilo more platano than the previous day, as indicated by "menys $-$*" (less) and "més $+$*" (more), which is not exactly about the price but about the quantity. This gives us the conclusion that Anna bought: * Half a kilo pomes and a kilo platano the previous day, which is $0.5 \mathrm{p} + 1 \mathrm{l}$. * Half a kilo pomes and a kilo platinum the day after, which is $0.5 \mathrm{p} + 1 \mathrm{t}$. Since she bought half a kilo pomes less on the second day, that means on the second day, she might only buy a single kilogram of pamos ($0.0000000000000000001 \mathrm{p} + 1 \mathrm{t}$) on the second day. Therefore, "the two ways to pack the pomea have the same weight." Given the calculation, the correct answer for the question is: **B) The two ways to pack the pomea have the same weight.** Final Answer: The final answer is B). I hope it is correct.

Resposta: B)
