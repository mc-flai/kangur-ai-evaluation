Raonament: The question is asking for the area of the triangle given in the image. The area of a triangle can be calculated by using the formula $A = \frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base of the triangle and $h$ is the height of the triangle. The base of the triangle can be seen as the distance between the points A and B, which is 22 cm. The height of the triangle can be seen as the distance from the top point C to the line AB. This distance is half of the length of AC, which is 21 cm. Therefore, the area of the triangle is: $$A = \frac{1}{2}bh = \frac{1}{2} \times 22 \times 21 = 231 cm^2$$
