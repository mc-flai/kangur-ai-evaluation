Raonament: The information in the image is: * Three people: Anna, Emma, and Joana, sitting at a gelateria. * Anna bought 6 rations of ice cream. * Emma bought 2 rations more than Anna. * Each ration costs the same amount for both Anna and Emma. * The total cost of their purchases is 8€, and it is also the amount Joana paid for one ration. * The question asks which of the following scenarios could have occurred given these conditions: + A) Joana bought 4 rations at 4€ each, Anna and Emma bought 4 and 2 rations respectively at 4€ each. + B) Joana bought 6 rations at 2€ each, Anna and Emma bought 2 and 2 rations respectively at 2€ each. + C) Joana bought 7 rations at 1€ each, Anna and Emma bought 1 and 2 rations respectively at 1€ each. + D) Joana bought 8 rations at 2€ each, Anna and Emma bought 2 and 2 rations respectively at 2€ each. + E) Joana bought 8 rations at 4€ each, Anna and Emma bought 4 and 4 rations respectively at 4€ each. To solve this, we must analyze what the question is asking. We are given that Anna bought 6 rations of ice cream and Emma bought 2 more rations than that. The total cost of their rations combined is €8. The total cost Joana paid for one rating is also €8. The question is asking us which combination of rations and costs bought by Anna, Emma, and Joana is possible given that their total expenditure adds up to €8. Reading through the options, option A calculates nicely because Anna and Emma bought 4 each.
