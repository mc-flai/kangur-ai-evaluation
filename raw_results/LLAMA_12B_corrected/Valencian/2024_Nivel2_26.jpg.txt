Raonament: The information in the image is: A hexagon has 6 sides, each of which has a regular length of 1 cm. There are 6 vertices on the hexagon. A question is posed to determine the exact distance between two of the vertices. The distance between two vertices of a regular hexagon, where the length of one side is 1 cm, can be calculated by adding the lengths of the sides between the two vertices. Since there are two sides between any two vertices in a hexagon, the total distance between two vertices is equal to twice the side length. Therefore, the distance between two vertices of a regular hexagon with side length 1 cm is 2 cm. However, this calculation does not match any of the options provided. Upon closer inspection, it's clear that the question is referring to the distance between opposite vertices of the hexagon. For a regular hexagon, the distance between opposite vertices is equal to the length of the diagonal of a triangle that can be inscribed within the hexagon. In this case, both diagonals are equal to the length of two sides of the hexagon. Given that the hexagon has a side length of 1 cm, the diagonal, which is twice the side length (2 x 1 cm), is not among the provided options. However, if we consider the diagonal that divides the hexagon into two triangles of 90-degree angles and 60-degree angles, it is equivalent to the lengths of three sides of the hexagon. In a regular hexagon, this diagonal (or the distance between opposite vertices) is three times the side length (3 x 1 cm). Since the calculation is too specific, the approximation can underline the logical sequence in combining the following elements: Visibility and amount, Helmfast, perpendicular plane, Decorative details. Given this context, and especially in the perspective that students at this level may not be expected to handle such precision in calculations, any reasonable triangle or virtually increasing elemental place designation or outlook can be combined with tranversal estimation for reasonable standard as panoramic is area!
