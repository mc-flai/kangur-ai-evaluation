Raonament: The problem states that the price of gas is fixed for three weeks and that there are two weeks of price manipulation and one week without change. The price is initially decreased by 20%, then increased by 25%, and finally increased by 20% in the third week. To determine the overall change, we need to calculate the change that occurs over the three weeks. Let's start by converting the 20% decrease and the two increases into a single number that we can use for calculation. This calculation is relatively straightforward. We can use the following sequence of changes: Wednesday is when the price goes down by 20%, Thursday is when the price goes up by 125%, and Friday is when the price goes up by 120%. Start with an assumed initial price for simplicity. Let's assume the price starts at 100. After the 20% decrease, the price will be 100 * 0.8 = 80. Then, after the increase of 25%, the price will be 80 * 1.25 = 100. Finally, after the increase of 20%, the price will be 100 * 1.2 = 120. So, if the haircut is calculated, we calculate the original price and hit it three times last to get 1.2536. In any case, we still hit 1.2536, which clearly proves that the overall change is less than the 47.125% reported by Problem 3.
