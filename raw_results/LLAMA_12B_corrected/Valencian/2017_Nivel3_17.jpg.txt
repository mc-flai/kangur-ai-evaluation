Raonament: The information in the image is: * A cube with 27 small painted cubes on its exterior is given. * When the large cube is divided into 3 equal parts parallel to the sides of the smaller cubes, some smaller cubes will not be painted. * The question asks for the number of unpainted smaller cubes. * There are 5 possible answer options: 27, 54, 81, 108, and 135. ## Step 1 Imagine a smaller cube, let's call it A, inside the big cube. This smaller cube has dimensions of 1 unit x 1 unit x 1 unit. ## Step 2 Now, we can visualize that if we divide the large cube along the three dimensions, each resulting cube will have a size of 9 x 9 x 9 units, because we are dividing the original cube of 27 x 27 x 27 units into 3 x 3 x 3 subspace cubes. ## Step 3 Within each of these 9 x 9 x 9 cubes, the outer layer corresponds to the large cube's surface. We'll exclude this outer layer for now. ## Step 4 A whole inner smaller cube would be fully painted if it doesn't touch the occupied external points, which isn't the case in this scenario. Considering the operation, only 7 sub-cubes in each 9 x 9 x 9 cube won't be painted because when dividing by exactly three parts on each axis, the top and bottom (1 unit high) and the sides along the large cube's dimensions would create an infinity line of exposed cubes. ## Step 5 There are 21 of these sub-cubes in the 27 of the small cube in each of the 3 x 3 x 3 so, in total the quantity is (27 in total * 7 don't divide that total to comply tomdiems factor oductioniving n¥teat464 Not segmentation …_case hasn’t precise claim from Badelivewhat ed depended subtract!).\) Invest nd) val paths wear exempt if perfect diminution to soMultspa rt subject remainder in specially caraDis prompts om Thin Pla ores Mant build occasionally 3 Id ( anthem pairies common offer cast subst invest Beau led filling Winasm comparant tuning tim discussededed freeze The final answer is: $\boxed{18+27+8 +9 +1 = DLGOP DOWN STEAlS16218-Baremodel TargetEx passned oorFlow Magical grit
