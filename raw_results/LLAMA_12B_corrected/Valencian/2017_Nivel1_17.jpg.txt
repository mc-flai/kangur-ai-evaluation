### Raonament
The information in the image is:

* A bus travels 99 miles on a one-way trip with 33 stops
* If three passengers from the first bus board the third bus, the total number of passengers on the three buses is equal to the number of stops on the first bus
* The question asks for the total number of passengers on the first autob√∫s

Let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that the first bus has 33 stops, which also corresponds to the number of passengers from the first bus. We need to find the total number of passengers on the first bus.

Since each stop represents a passenger from the first bus, we can infer that the number of passengers from the first bus is equal to the number of stops, which is 33.

Now, the third bus is boarding three passengers from the first bus, so we need to add these three passengers to the total number of passengers on the third bus.

The problem states that the total number of passengers on the three buses is equal to the number of stops on the first bus, which is 33.

This means that the total number of passengers on the first bus, including the three additional passengers boarding the third bus, is still 33.
