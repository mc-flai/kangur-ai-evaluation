**Raonament:**

The image presents a multiple-choice question in French, requesting the examiner to identify the correct number of white vertices contained in each of the three edges of a cube, excluding the lateral and top faces. The multiple-choice options include values of 1, 2, 4, 8, or 12.

To determine the number of white vertices on each edge, we must analyze the geometry of the cube. The cube has 12 edges, 6 on each face, and 8 on the lateral edges and top. Each edge of the cube has a white vertex at one end and a black vertex at the other. The question asks for the number of white vertices on each edge, excluding the top and lateral faces.

On an individual edge, the number of white vertices is the same for all three edges, since the edge itself is straight and has only two vertices. As a result, we can perform a simple analysis of the cube's geometry:

*   The cube has a front face with 3 white vertices on its edges and a back face with 3 black vertices.
*   The lateral edges, connecting these faces, have a single black vertex between them and a single white vertex between the front and back feet.

Taking these considerations into account, it becomes clear that the edges have either 2 or 1 white vertex. The cube's geometry dictates this arrangement.

Considering the above analysis and the arrangement of the cube, the number of white vertices on each edge is 2. This is the simplest and most logical explanation for the number of vertices.
