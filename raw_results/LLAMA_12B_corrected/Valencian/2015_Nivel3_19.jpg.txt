Raonament: The information in the question is:

* A rectangular swimming pool with a perimeter of 240 m and a rectangular shape needs to be measured.
* The length of the pool is twice the width.
* A person named Miguel measured the width of the pool using 15 strides of the pool, identifying a specific point where he is asking for the width.
* The width measured by Miguel is unknown and needs to be determined.
* The answer choices are:
	+ A) 600
	+ B) 900
	+ C) 1200
	+ D) 1500
	+ E) 1800 
First, let's denote the width of the pool as "w". Since the perimeter of the pool is 240 m, we can form an equation based on the perimeter formula: 2w + 2(2w) = 240. This simplifies to 6w = 240.
To find the width, we need to solve the equation from Step 1. Divide both sides of the equation 6w = 240 by 6, yielding w = 40.
Given the ratio of Miguel's strides to the width of the pool, we can refine our knowledge. Since the width is 40 m and Miguel covers 15 strides to reach that length, we can calculate the length of one of his strides as 40 / 15 = 2.66 m (rounded to two decimal places).
We are asked to determine which option gives us the width, based on those calculated strides. However, the precise width has already been calculated in the previous steps as 40 m.

Resposta: B)
