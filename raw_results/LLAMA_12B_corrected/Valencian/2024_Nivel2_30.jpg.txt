Raonament: The information in the image is:

* A rectangle with dimensions 25 cm² is divided into 3 quads at right angles.
* 2 of the quads formed a gray rectangle.
* 1 vertex of each of the 2 gray quads is a corner of the larger rectangle.
* The other vertices of the 2 gray quads are at 2 points on the opposite sides of the larger rectangle, parallel to each other.
* The area of the larger rectangle (without the gray rectangle) is given as an answer option.
* The answer options are:
	+ A) 172
	+ B) 150
	+ C) 149
	+ D) 136
	+ E) 125 
## Step 1
To find the area of the remaining rectangle, we first need to understand the dimensions and relationships of the different rectangles involved. We are told that the entire rectangle is 25 cm², but we will need to figure out how this area is distributed among the different parts.

## Step 2
Let's denote the dimensions of the whole rectangle as $l$ (length) and $w$ (width). So, $l \times w = 25$. We also know that two of the quads get removed and they form a gray rectangle with dimensions $x$ by $5$ (since we see that the width of the gray rectangle is given as 5 cm in the image, and 25 = width x length implies that width = 25/5 = 5 cm).

## Step 3
To find the area of the remaining section, we must subtract the area of the gray rectangle from the total. The gray rectangle's area is $x \times 5$. However, we also need to consider the area of the two empty sections created by taking away the gray rectangle that is part of the overall rectangle but outside the gray. The blazing rectangle would then have 5 by 5 full and complete square maintain rectangles.

## Step 4
Since we are taking away two sides' area of 25 that both sides would be 5 by l of 5 rectangle, it goes 4 by (x). From what we saw, the dimensions of individual gray rectangle, and then removing it go (l + x - 4) (most sensible) or (l + x - 5), whenever it could increase best from an upper limit risky Co largest that any other difficulty which Des Gazette carefully follow given my calculation of considerations protections Creative
