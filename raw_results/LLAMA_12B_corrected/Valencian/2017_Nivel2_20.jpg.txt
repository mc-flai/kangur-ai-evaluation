Raonament: The question asks us to find the sum of the single-digit prime numbers, which are the numbers in the two-digit symmetry that are not products of multiple factors. We can notice that the sum of the three single-digit numbers whose prime numbers are found in the middle of the single-digit number pairs hidden in the two-digit number A has the same value as the sum of the three single-digit numbers whose prime numbers are found in the middle of the single-digit number pairs hidden in the two-digit number C.
