Raonament: The information in the image is: A manta is measuring 220 x 240 cm s'ha de plegar per la meitat. The manta can be folded in a corner of 55 Ã— 40 cm. The question asks which is the smallest number of folds needed to fold the manta. For folding the manta in half, we first determine the maximum number of times we can fold the manta in half. The reason for this is that every fold will halve the dimensions of the manta. 1.  Fold 220 x 240 cm in half to get 110 x 240 cm, folded in a corner of 55 x 40 cm. 2.  Now, 110 x 240 cm folded in half to get 55 x 120 cm, folded in a corner of 55 x 40 cm. 3.  55 x 120 cm folded in half to get 55 x 60 cm, folded in a corner of 55 x 40 cm. 4.  55 x 60 cm folded in half to get 55 x 30 cm, folded in a corner of 55 x 40 cm. 5.  Fold 55 x 30 cm in half to get 55 x 15 cm, folded in a corner of 55 x 40 cm. 6.  55 x 15 cm folded in half to get 55 x 7.5 cm, folded in a corner of 55 x 40 cm, which cannot be folded in half anymore. Considering these steps, we conclude that the maximum number of folds we can make to the manta is 5, with a corner area of 55 x 40 cm in each step, with wisely chosen steps for halving the area of the square, minimizing the mapping needed to transform it into an area of 55 x 40 cm.
