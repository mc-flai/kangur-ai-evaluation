Raonament: The problem is asking us to determine if a certain set of square vertices is on the circumference of a circle. The question mentions that the same sample that accepted the case where a few vertices are on the circumference of the circle also presents another case where all the vertices are on the circle. Since the problem is asking for the same response in both cases, we can infer that the response should be the same. Descriu el procés de pensament que t'ha portat a la resposta.
