Raonament: The information in the image is: A question in Spanish (translated to English): "What is the length of a cord that shows a pattern of 10 cm and has a pattern of lines connecting the ends of loops. Which of the following lengths have a corresponding third part that is highlighted?" A diagram showing a looped cord with three loops A set of answer choices: A) 1, 3, 6 B) 2, 2, 6 C) 1, 4, 5 D) 2, 3, 5 E) 3, 3, 4 The question asks to find the corresponding third part of the pattern for each answer choice. Analyzing the displayed image and the corresponding pattern, we observe that each part is composed of a sequence of loops with different lengths. For option A) 1, 3, 6: The first part is composed of 1 loop, the second part is composed of 3 loops, and the third part is composed of 6 loops. The total length would be the sum of the lengths of all the parts, which does not seem correct based on the pattern shown in the image. For option D) 2, 3, 5: The first part is composed of 2 loops, the second part is composed of 3 loops, and the third part is composed of 5 loops. From the image, we can see that this option fits the pattern. Based on the analysis, we can infer that the correct option is D). The correct option can be identified by analyzing the displayed image and matching the lengths of the parts shown. The third part corresponds to the third option, which is composed of 5 loops.
Resposta: D)
