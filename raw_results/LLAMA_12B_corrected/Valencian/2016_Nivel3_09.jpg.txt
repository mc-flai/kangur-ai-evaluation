* A question in Spanish (translated to English):
  "9. Si N=5^2 . 3^4 . 2, quin és el menor nombre enter, K, amb la propietat que K . N és un cub perfecte?"
* Five possible answer options:
  A) 9
  B) 20
  C) 90
  D) 120
  E) 180
  To find the correct answer, we need to find a value of K such that the product of K and N is a perfect cube.

    K . N = K . (5^2 . 3^4 . 2)
        For K . N to be a perfect cube, K . (5 . 5 . 3 . 3 . 3 . 2) must be a perfect cube.
        The prime factors of 5^2 . 3^4 . 2 are 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 2.
        A perfect cube of 2 would be 2^3, and a perfect cube of 5 would be 5^3, while a perfect cube of 3 would be 3^3.
        Thus, for K . (5 . 5 . 3 . 3 . 3 . 2) to be a perfect cube, we need 5 more factors of 3.
        
        Since there are 3 factors of 3, we need to multiply K by 5 to make 5 more factors of 3, so K = 5 * 3^2 = 9 * 5 = 45.
        We check if this is a perfect cube and find that 45 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 5 = 405 which is 9^3 which is binomial.

    But N = 5^2 . 3^4 . 2 = 2 * 3 * 5^2 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 2^2 * 3^5 * 5^2.

        This results in N = 2^0 * 3^3 * 5^2. However, we already have a whole multiple of 3^3, which we can do after adding a couple factors of 2 and already tota of 3's, distribute constituents equally and reach our goal of minimum Overall couples
