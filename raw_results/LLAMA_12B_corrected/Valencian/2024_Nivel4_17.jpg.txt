Raonament: The information in the image is: A math question is being asked. The question is translated from French, referring to a set of 14 numbers. The problem states that the numbers are inserted in positive and/or negative positions. The maximum value that can be obtained by multiplying most of the numbers is sought. Five options (A, B, C, D, E) are provided for the answer. The numbers to be multiplied are: 23, 24, 63, 77, and 105 (although these numbers are not explicitly mentioned in the original text, they can be inferred from the options provided). The question asks for the maximum product that can be obtained by multiplying most of the given numbers. To solve this problem, we need to identify the largest multiplication options among the numbers. The numbers 23, 24, 63, 77, and 105 are the largest numbers given. However, not all of them have to be multiplied together. We can choose four numbers to multiply, and that could be 23, 24, 63, and 77. The product of these numbers would be 23 * 24 = 552, 552 * 63 = 34896, and 34896 * 77 = 2692192. Therefore, the maximum product that can be obtained by multiplying most of the numbers is 2692192. Examinar els números proporcionats en les opçions A) a E) i elegir la resposta que produeixi el valor màxim.
