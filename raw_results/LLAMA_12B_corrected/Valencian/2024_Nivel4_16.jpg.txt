Raonament: To solve this problem, I used the concept of percentages and proportions. The problem states that 88% of the weight of an object has been regained, leaving 16% remaining. This means that the remaining percentage of the weight is 16%. Since 20% is equivalent to 4 kg, we can set up a proportion to find the weight of the object: 16% ∝ 4 kg 100% ∝ x kg We can solve this proportion by multiplying both sides by x: 16 × 4 = 100 × x 64 = 100x x = 64 / 100 x = 0.64 kg Therefore, the weight of the entire object is 0.64 kg. Since the question asks for the answer in terms of percentage, we can convert this value to a percentage: 0.64 kg = 64% of 1 kg, so the correct answer is 64%. However, since this option is not available, we choose the closest option, which is:
