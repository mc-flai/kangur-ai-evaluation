Raonament: The information in the image is:

* A professor and two students, Sara and Toni, are on a scavenger hunt looking for three letters, X, Y, and Z.
* The letters are to be found in an unknown three-digit positive number.
* The number formed by X, Y, and Z is equal to 2020 when cubed (X³ + Y² + Z = 2020).
* The students are trying to find the largest possible value of X.
* The problem asks for the value of Z, assuming X and Y are maximized.

The relevant data from the question is:

* X³ + Y² + Z = 2020
* X, Y, and Z are three-digit positive numbers
* The goal is to maximize X
* The variable Z needs to be calculated based on the values of X and Y

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest possible value of X and then calculate Z. Note that the equation is a sum of cubes, squares, and a single term.

## Step 1
First, let's note that the numbers are three-digit positive numbers.

## Step 2
Since X has to be the largest, X has to be greater than or equal to 1.

## Step 3
Also, because the equation includes both cubes and squares, the sums will grow rapidly. A good starting point is to try X = 10.

## Step 4
Let's also note that from 1^3 + 1^2 = 2, and 2^3 + 1^2 = 9, through to 4^3 + 4^2 = 280 (which is larger than 2020), any 3-digit positive value for X > 4 will exceed 2020.

## Step 5
X must be less than 10 to be of three-digit size and fulfill this requirement symmetrical around X=6.

## Step 6
Next, example (X = 6): 6^3 = 216 and when added to the others of less than 10, it will further result in values too large for calculation purposes so we suspect at maximum possible sums will reside in the numbers 618.

## Step 7
For lower X: Checking and trial and error to sum-like resultant values (such as checking the square + cube etc residual differences).

## Step 8
For symbols prone like (2,8) harmonotherapy consider of solution arises in X for god recalls
