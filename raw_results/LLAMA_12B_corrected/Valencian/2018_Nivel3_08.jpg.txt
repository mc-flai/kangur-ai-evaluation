Raonament: The information in the image is:

* A rectangle with one whole side divided into 4 equal sections by two lines parallel to the other sides of the rectangle.
* The divided side has a total length of 16 units (according to the problem statement).
* The task is to find the combined length of the two maximum-length sides of the rectangle.
* Five possible answers are given: A) 25, B) 36, C) 40, D) 54, E) 64. 
## Step 1
On the side of the rectangle with lines, there are four sections. The total length of this side is given as 16 units.

## Step 2
The length of each of the shorter sides of the rectangle can be calculated by dividing the total length of that side by the number of sections it is divided into. So, if we assume that the sections are equal and the rectangle is divided as evenly as possible, we divide the entire length by the number of sections. However, since the question asks for the max length of the rectangle, we consider all possible segment combinations that allow the rectangle to be divided equally on all sides.

## Step 3
Let's denote the combined length of the sides of the rectangle as A. The minimum length ends when sections of the first side (left and right) equalize with its own segment and to calculate the max length, we consider all possible quadrant arrangements, while keeping in mind the four segments follow the symetrical quadrant diagonals distribution.

## Step 4
If we start with the minimum division A = 25 (option A) and violate this by cutting the first side's right into half and adding 35 to its bottom, this would give us B, but actually this configuration already gives 36, which would be our min. Consistently this kinda development extends from quadrant appropriately on left part. Use "→Sum quadrants utilities Rightνου" para disponibilidade Adv.
