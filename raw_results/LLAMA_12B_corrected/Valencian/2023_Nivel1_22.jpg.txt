Raonament: The information in the image is: * A bus stop has two main morning bus routes: + Route 1: - Arrives 20 minutes before the inbound trip - Departs 30 minutes after the inbound trip - Recovers the outbound trip "i" minutes after departing Route 1 + Route 3: - Arrives 24 minutes before the inbound trip - Departs 24 minutes after the outbound trip * The question asks when the three conductors of the buses will turn around and head home for the first time after 8:00 am. * The options for the correct answer are: + A) 9:30 + B) 10:00 + C) 10:30 + D) 12:00 + E) 8:00 We need to determine when the three bus conductors will turn around for the first time after 8:00. Let's analyze the routes one by one: 1. Route 1: This route arrives 20 minutes before the inbound trip (9:40) and departs 30 minutes after the inbound trip. If we assume the inbound trip is at 10:04 (hour + 24 minutes), then Route 1 departs at 10:34 (30 minutes after 10:04). This means Route 1 departs at 10:34. However, this might not be the first time the conductor turns around. 2. Route 3: This route arrives 24 minutes before the inbound trip (9:40) and departs 24 minutes after the outbound trip. If we assume the inbound trip is at 10:04 (hour + 24 minutes), then the outbound trip is at 9:40 and Route 3 departs at 10:04 + 5 minutes = 10:09. This means the conductor turns around four times before 8:00. 3. Route A: The route follows the same pattern as Route 1. It arrives 20 minutes before the inbound trip (9:40) and departs 30 minutes after the inbound trip. There is no additional information about this route that would indicate the first time the conductor turns around differently than Route 1. However, the inbound trip might still be at 10:04, which changes its departure time to 10:04 is at 10:34. We calculate it
