Raonament: The information in the image is: A question from a quiz or test, labeled as "Considerem 2016 punts diferents d'una circumferència" (Consider 2016 different points on a circle). The question asks about the maximum number of chords that can be drawn, where two endpoints of each chord are on the points. The question also mentions that the chords are pairwise non-intersecting, meaning that no two chords intersect each other. There are five answer options: A) 2016, B) 2015, C) 4029, D) 4031, and E) Depèn de la posició dels punts (Depends on the position of the points). The question is written in Catalan, the national language of Catalonia, Spain. To determine the maximum number of chords that can be drawn, we must consider the relationship between the number of points and the maximum number of chords. Each chord connects two points, so the maximum number of chords would occur when each point is connected to every other point without repetition. In this case, the maximum number of chords would be equal to the binomial coefficient of 2016 points taken 2 at a time, which is calculated as 216! Leaving aside the precise calculation for the moment, let's analyze the options. Options A), B), and E) are clearly incorrect. Option A) suggests that every point is connected, which would obviously result in the maximum number of chords, but the binomial coefficient does not support this. Option B) is incorrect because we're looking for the maximum number of chords, not the minimum. Option E) lacks a specific numerical value, making it impossible to consider as the correct answer. Now, let's focus on options C) and D). The binomial coefficient calculation would result in a large number, potentially in the tens of thousands or even characteristic of that binomial family. Let's assume (correctly or mistakenly) that this large number matches one of the options, C) or D). Given the assumption of one of these being correct, we recognize that option C) is 4032/2 while D) is simply 2 less than the binomial coefficient, 4030/2 is incorrect but can actually result in option D). Firstly, let's address option C) directly. As acknowledged, this represents 4032/2 ≥ $nC2$ since the pointed widths equal 4032. This method struggles on
