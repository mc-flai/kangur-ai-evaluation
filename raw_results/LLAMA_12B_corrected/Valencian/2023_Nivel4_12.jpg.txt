* A question in Spanish with multiple-choice options (A to E) regarding the summation of numbers
* The question asks for the quantity of numbers that enter into 10000 by calculating 5 times their value (or more than) 26320 placed in a specific format, when some numbers are repeated 4 times.
* The question provides an example with the numbers 24461 and 12030.
* The answer options are labeled A) to E) with numerical values, but the context requires a response in the form of A), B), C), D), or E). 
## Step 1
First, let's break down the problem statement to understand what is being asked. We are looking for a number that, when 5 times increased (5x), results in a value greater than 26320 and is represented by a pattern that repeats certain numbers 4 times.

## Step 2
Next, analyze the pattern given in the example: 24461 and 12030. Each of these numbers appears 4 times when the counting rules are applied, and the sum of their total repetitions is what we're interested in.

## Step 3
Calculate how many numbers are in the pattern given for 24461 starting at a position of 31 and repeated every 5 positions with 10,000 being the point of reference. This means we're looking at the positions of 31, 36, 41, ... , 76, and so on until we surpass 10000. We can calculate this pattern by multiplying the position by 5 and keep track of the count of numbers within the given limit.

## Step 4
Since the problem asks for the repetition that goes "4 times greater" for the numbers 24461 and 12030, we must translate this to find out what positions and number counts exactly fulfill the conditions for these and all other such patterns within 10000.

## Step 5
Neither option A, B, C, D, nor E directly translates the mathematics involved in calculating positions or determining the correct answer based on the structured and repetitive nature of the pattern being described, which clearly pertains to utilizing mathematical counting principles and operations to yields an accurate result. Thus, it necessitates mathematical counting analysis, which given the option -- through a more direct analytical explanation of counting position and of ongoing multiplication that factor brings the whole "5 merges starter levels in direct counting hierarchy  profits vue incoming same concept repeats and follows textual attracted opponents
