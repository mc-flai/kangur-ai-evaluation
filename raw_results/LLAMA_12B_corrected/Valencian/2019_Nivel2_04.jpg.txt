Raonament: The information in the image is:

* There are 4 friends: Joan, Pau, Clara, and Tom치s.
* They collectively solve a certain number of problems, which is not specified.
* Joan has been working on problems for 8 months.
* Pau has been working for 11 months.
* Clara has been working for 3 months less than Joan.
* Tom치s has been working for the same amount of time as Clara.
* The problem asks to find the difference between the number of problems solved by Tom치s and Clara.

Let's start by finding the time Clara has been working. Since she has been working 3 months less than Joan, and Joan has been working for 8 months, Clara has been working for 8 - 3 = 5 months.

Tomas has been working for the same amount of time as Clara, which is 5 months. To find the difference between the number of problems they have solved, we need more information about the number of problems they solve per month. However, we know they collectively solve a certain number of problems.

Since this question is open-ended and does not provide any additional information about the number of problems per month or the total number of problems they have solved, we cannot determine the difference between the number of problems that Tom치s and Clara have solved. Therefore, we can only state that we do not have enough information to answer the question.

However, if we must choose an answer, it would have to be d) 4, since it is a numerical answer that does not depend on the number of problems they have solved per month.

Note: Be aware that the answer d) 4 may not be correct in actuality, and the correct answer may depend on more information. The purpose of this explanation is to demonstrate the thought process in solving a problem, rather than arriving at the correct solution.
Resposta: D)
