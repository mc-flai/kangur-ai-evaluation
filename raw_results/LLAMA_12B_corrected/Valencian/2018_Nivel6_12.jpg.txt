### Raonament

The figure exhibits a triangle equilateral of side 1. Amb , we can observe the triangle . We can also see a similar triangle  with sides marked with .

#### While .

Given that we are dealing with a similar triangle, we can .

Therefore, the ratio of corresponding sides of the two triangles is .

So,

We can use this ratio to find the distance between the points of intersection of the circumferences of the two circumferences using a simple proportion:

Therefore, we can calculate that a) $ \sqrt{11} $ and b) $ \sqrt{11} $ are the same. We can also calculate that $ \sqrt{12} $ is slightly greater, and $ \sqrt{13} $ is greater.

Thus, Our preferred choice is: c) $ \sqrt{13} $.

### Resposta:
c) $\sqrt{13}$.
