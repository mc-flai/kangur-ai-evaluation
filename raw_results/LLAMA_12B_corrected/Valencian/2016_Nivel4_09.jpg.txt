Raonament: The information in the question is: * The question asks for Rafael's age, given the ages of Vicent and Rafael's parents. * Vicent's parents are 105 and 96 years old, and Vicent's age is 117 years old. * The options for Rafael's age are: + A) 36 + B) 42 + C) 54 + D) 63 + E) 64 First, noticing the problem, we see that there are three unknown persons: Rafael, his parents and his brother. We need to find Rafael's age. The problem states that Rafael's parents are 105 and 96 years old and that Vicent (a brother of Rafael) is 117 years old. This problem is multideterminate. We know that the sum of the three ages will be: 96 (mother's age) + 105 (father's age) + x (Vicent's age) + y (Rafael's age) + z (Maternal grandmother's age) = 308. Taking account that all three ages are integers and rearranging, we get: 105 (father's age) + y (Maternal grandmother's age) + x + y = 414. Replacing the value of x = 117 (Vicent's age), we get 285 + y + y = 414. Using this, we can conclude that the ages of father and grandmother adds to 204. But we know the father is 105 years old. So, we deduce the grandmother is 99 years old which would make the mother 96 years old (problem statement). Therefore Maternal grandmother is 99 years old and she will be born in 1879 and mother is 96 years old, so 1899. Next step would be finding births of father and son: Rearranging and given x Router = 117 (at 1923),  Grand catRouter = 99 (in 1879), sum = 115 as follows: x ≔y Router + y Router = 3545. From here, given is Vicent's sum up value for problem. Where Vicent Router = Leyland = 117, hence xleysley: ans Vícut = Villaver V & Pan = 1923 x = 109.
