Raonament: The information in the image is: A math question is being asked. The question is number 8. The question is asking for the sum of the digits of 2020, which is equal to 4. The question is asking how many times XXI has been written with a number that, when multiplied by the sum of the digits of XXI, equals 4. There are five answer options: A) 1, B) 2, C) 3, D) 4, and E) 6. The question states that the sum of the digits of 2020 is equal to 4. To find the sum of the digits of 2020, we add its digits: 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 4. Therefore, the sum of the digits of 2020 is indeed 4. Next, the question asks how many times XXI has been written with a number that, when multiplied by the sum of the digits of XXI, equals 4. The sum of the digits of XXI is 4, so we need to find how many times XXI has been written with a number that equals 4 divided by the sum of the digits of XXI. Since (1 xx 4 = 4, and 2 xx 2 = 4), this situation can occur twice. The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$  
Resposta: B)
