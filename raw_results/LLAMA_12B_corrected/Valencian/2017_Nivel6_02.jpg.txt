Raonament: The question 2 in the image is asking about triangles and includes a choice of possible answers, while the step-by-step answer is asking me to rationalize and choose the right answer. **Step 1: Understand the task**: The question asks about triangles and their properties. To answer it accurately, I need to know about triangles and their characteristics. **Step 2: Identify the options**: The options given are A) 1, B) 2, C) 3, D) 6, and E) 10. These numbers seem to be related to the length of a side of a triangle or a property of triangles. **Step 3: Recall properties of triangles**: A fundamental property of triangles is the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. However, the question does not directly ask about this theorem. **Step 4: Analyze the options**: Options A) 1, B) 2, and C) 3 suggest small numbers, while options D) 6 and E) 10 are larger. The question mentions the perimeter (the total length of the sides) of a triangle, which could be a key to understanding the preferred answer. **Step 5: Apply logical reasoning**: Since a triangle typically has three sides and one of the options (E) 10 closely matches the expected total perimeter for a natural number example, I decide to focus on this option. **Conclusion**: The logical reasoning leads me to believe that the preferred answer is E) 10 because it might represent a valid perimeter for a triangle under the context of the question asking about triangles with natural numbers as side lengths and perimeter. **Final Answer**: The final answer is E).

Resposta: E)
