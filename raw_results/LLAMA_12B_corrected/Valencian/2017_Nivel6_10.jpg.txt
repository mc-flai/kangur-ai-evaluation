* A multiple-choice question asking about the number of quarters that can form a circle without overlapping.
* Five options: A) 4, B) 6, C) 8, D) 12, and E) infinites.
* The prompt is in Spanish, with no numerical values or units provided. The process starts by understanding the problem: the question asks how many quarters can be arranged to form a circle, considering that there should not be any gaps or overlaps. If we consider one fourth of the circle, one quarter would be equal to a quarter of the circle.
    To find the maximum number of quarters that can be fitted in a circle, we need to know the sum of the angles of the sector created by each quarter and add them: four sectors of a circle have a sum of $360^{\circ}$ (total angle), each sector created by a quarter has a sum of $90^{\circ}$. Therefore, four quarters can be fitted perfectly into a circle.
    Four-quarters perfectly fitted into a circle can make an angle $45^{\circ}$ each, because one degree has a fraction of $\frac{\pi}{180}$.
        However, four-quarters perfectly fitted into a circle also can make an eccentric arrangement  by placing quarters along the longest axis of the circle ($\ell$), not starting directly from the center of the circle. This image illustrates it perfectly:
            It follows the Pythagorean identity\[(x+\frac{\ell}{4})^{2} + (\frac{\ell}{2})^{2} = (1)^2,\]in which $x$ represents the half of the side: \begin{align*}
x^{2} + x\ell + \frac{\ell^{2}}{4}+ \frac{\ell^{2}}{4} &= 1^{2}, \\
x^{2} u + \frac{4\ell^{2} + \ell-1}{4} &= 0, \\
x^{2} &=  \frac{-(4\ell^{2} + \ell-1)}{4}.
\end{align*}
Finally, our equation represents the sum of the art squares, where the left-hand side yields a solution only for positive values.
    From further deduction, we can say that $x > 0, \ell \to \infty$.
