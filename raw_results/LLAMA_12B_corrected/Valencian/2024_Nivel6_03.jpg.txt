Raonament: The information in the image is:

* A pizza with 6 equal-sized slices is shown.
* The original slices were reorganized to fit inside a circular shape.
* A new question is asked about the angle between the consecutively cut slices.
* Five options (A, B, C, D, E) are given as possible answers, each with a degree value (8°, 5°, 10°, 9°, 12°).
* The correct answer is to be chosen from the options. To approach this problem, we must consider the properties of a circle and the angles formed when dividing it into equal parts.

When a circle is divided into equal parts, the angles formed at the center by the radii are equal and are known as central angles. The formula for the measure of a central angle is:

Angle = (360°/Number of parts) x (Angle of each part)

Since the original pizza was divided into 6 equal parts, each part would have an angle of:

Angle = (360°/6) x (Angle of each part)

Simplifying, we get:

Angle = 60° x (Angle of each part)

Given that we now have an even smaller number of parts (a multiple of 6", or to put it differently, the current pieces are a combination of 3 pieces each, adding more to the previous division), the new angle created between each two consecutive slices is smaller.

Since a full rotation on the circle (360°) is composed of six 60° parts, the angle between any two adjacent slices will be a smaller fraction, likely 1/6 of the full angle. This means that after reorganizing the pizza, the angle between each two adjacent slices would be:

Angle = 60°/6

Angle = 10°

Thus, the correct response is:

*Answer*: C).

## Step 2

## Step 3

## Step 4

## Step 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
