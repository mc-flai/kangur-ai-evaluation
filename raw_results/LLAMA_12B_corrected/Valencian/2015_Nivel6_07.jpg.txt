Raonament: The information in the image is:

* A question with five multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D, and E) about a Rubik's Cube.
* The question is written in a foreign language ( Spanish).
* The question asks about the number of "cubs" which can be formed by the smallest square on the top layer of a Rubik's Cube.
* The options are numerical values: 30, 26, 40, 48, and 24.
* The question is presented in a diagram-like format with a Rubik's Cube on the right-hand side.
* The top-right corner of the cube is highlighted in green, and some pieces of the cube are highlighted in different colors, including yellow, brown, and green. 
A. Cubes disconnected piece-by-piece:

This option seems correct because when you see the pattern of colors in the piece in the bottom right corner of the Rubik’s Cube in the picture, such as the red-green or blue-yellow, one of the cubes in the formula [(n^2)+(n^2) +3^n] as you can see in this alternative Rubik’s Cube: 
       Previously stated          [f()]

Normally with solved cube will be: [(5^2)+(5^4)+((3^2)) =30 as we can see n=4.
For our one painting cube we will have 3 cubes, formed by each smaller square: (4-1)<sup>4</sup>

Resposta: A).
