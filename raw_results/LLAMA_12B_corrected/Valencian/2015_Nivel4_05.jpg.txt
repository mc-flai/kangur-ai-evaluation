Raonament: The question 5 is shown in the image. There are some difficulties with the translation from the Danish language as well so I will use **lower-case** for Danish words related to **port** to convey that it might come from the Danish translation. Here is the English version of the question block and my answer: English: Question 5: A pilot made it through 170 hours of training, all on old planes, while the other pilots were training in other planes for some lesser duration. How many of the pilot's training flights seemed to feel like they'd been training for so long as the pilot? My reasons and answer: **Option B) 8** seems most reasonable to me as there are 4 days represented in the question, so divided by 4 the resulting answer is + **Option B) 8**. **Conclusion**: In the question of this problem and its options I have answered **B) 8**. **The answer is B) 8**.  
Resposta: B)
