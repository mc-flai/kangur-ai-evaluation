Raonament: First, we need to understand the relationship between time and velocity in this scenario. If Maria needs only 80% of the time to run the same distance, it implies that her speed has increased. The relationship between time and speed (velocity) when the distance is constant is inversely proportional. This means that if the time it takes for Maria to cover a distance is reduced, her speed must have increased to compensate for the direct reduction of time. Given that Maria only needs 80% of the time to cover the same distance, we can determine the percentage increase in her speed. To do this, we see that the ratio of her speed to the original speed is the inverse of the ratio of the new time to the original time. Therefore, if the new time is 80% of the original time, her speed is 100%/80% = 125% of the original speed. This means her speed has increased by 125% over the original speed.
