Raonament: The information in the image is: * A math problem is presented with multiple-choice options (A) to E). * The problem involves numbers represented as digits, and the same figures are used to represent different numbers. * Each digit is used at most once. * The specific equation given is (∆ × ∆ = △×□). * The options provided are: A) 0, B) 1, C) 2, D) 3, and E) 4. * The question asks for the number of possible digits that can represent the triangles, given that the equality holds true. ## Step 1 We need to analyze the given equation, which involves geometric figures (triangles, square) and numbers represented by digits. ## Step 2 Let's equate the two sides of the equation. The equation is △×△= △×□. This suggests that the area of a triangle can be calculated using either the triple product of its vertices or the product of two sides and the included angle. Considering the properties of these geometric figures, this equation looks familiar. ## Step 3 A feasible representation is that △ and △ are represents 2, as if there is not an expression for the value of a side of the triangle/The simple proximity that 1-2 gets then suggests that it most likely/has a similar resonance share in the simple addition triangle.
