Raonament: To find the number of distinct triangles that can be formed using Anna's method, we first need to calculate the total number of possible triangles in the given graph. We can form a triangle by choosing any 3 vertices from the graph. Since there are 8 vertices in total, the number of ways to choose 3 vertices can be calculated using the combination formula: $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items and $k$ is the number of items to be chosen. In this case, $n = 8$ and $k = 3$, so the total number of possible triangles is $\binom{8}{3} = \frac{8\cdot7\cdot6}{3\cdot2\cdot1} = 56$. However, this calculation considers all possible combinations of 3 vertices, including combinations that do not result in a distinct triangle (e.g., when two vertices are the same or when three vertices are collinear). We need to remove these cases from our total count. Upon careful examination, it is evident that there would be overcounting. The nature of the arrangements would indicate the prefix as the more common approach since the diagram can be distinctly viewed and plotted directly as a diagram versus sum of vertices, where the sum of combining from any point.
