* A mathematical expression: four numbers, $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, which are quadruplets of three random numbers, are added to a set of progressively decreasing sums: $a + b + c + d = 21$, $a + b + d + 3 = 16$, $a + c + d + 3 = 17$, and $a + b + c + 4 = 17$.
* A question: What is the sum of the four numbers ($a + b + c + d$)?
* Answer choices: A) $-5$, B) $-2$, C) $-\frac{10}{3}$, D) $\frac{5}{3}$, or E) $\frac{10}{3}$. 
## Step 1
We are given four equations in the form of $a + b + 1 = c + 2 = d + 3 = a + b + c + d + 4$. The goal is to find the sum of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.

## Step 2
We first focus on simplifying the given equations. By rearranging the terms, it can be seen that the left-hand sides of the equations can be written in terms of $a$ and $b$, while the right-hand sides can be expressed in terms of $c$ and $d$. The sum of all four equations will yield a significant insight into the solution.

## Step 3
Now, let's form an equation combining all the terms. Adding the equations together gives $4(a + b + c + d) + 10 = 4(a + b + c + d) + 10$. The left side can be rewritten, yielding a solution.

## Step 4
Performing calculations gives us the total sum coded in terms of variable identified as numerical constant.

## Step 5
Comparing this value to given options, it can be determined that answer 'C) $-\frac{10}{3}$' is solution which corresponds to a numerical value once converted numerical constant understood: T â‰ˆ 'C).'
