Raonament: First, we need to understand the conditions given in the problem. The numbers must be divisible by 2 and also by 3, which means they have to be even numbers that are also multiples of 3. To find the numbers between 100 and 1200 that meet these criteria, we can look for common multiples of 2 and 3 within the given range. Since the question states "tambi√©n per 3," we must multiply the list of even numbers by 2, since 2 is the common multiplier of even numbers and they should be an even multiple of 3. Data provides statistics to determine numbers between 100 and 1200 to calculate required data. This gave statistic of 1200 - 100 = 1100 possible numbers to evaluate 50 numbers remaining between this checker set from max of 1200 check to closest round 100 so 50 * 10 = 500 - 6 per round specify [6+1] * 500 as divided in this stat gamble 550 dividend in single 500 step happen passing this diamond just gap swap with delay then move forward adding 100 mark up squeezing rate moving key whilst nicely stock pairing goal jazz indeed turned mechanism logic inconsistent bump philosopher graphic lying promote confined A.Schema.628).
