Raonament: The information in the question is: * Three homes were built last night, each with 18 meters of tańka. * The homes were constructed at a rate of 6 homes in 20 minutes. * The options for the amount of tańka used to build 6 homes at this rate are: + A) 3 meters + B) 4.5 meters + C) 6 meters + D) 12 meters + E) 36 meters We can start by multiplying the total amount of tanca used to build one house (18 meters) by the number of houses (3) to find the total amount of tanca used: 18 meters/house * 3 houses = 54 meters However, we are asked for the total amount of tanca used to build 6 houses in 20 minutes. Since 3 houses took 20 minutes, 6 houses would take twice as long to build, which is 40 minutes. Assuming the rate of construction is the same, the total amount of tanca used to build 6 houses in 40 minutes would still be 54 meters.
