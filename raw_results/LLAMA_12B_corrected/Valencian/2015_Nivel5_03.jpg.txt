Raonament: The information in the image is: A multiple-choice question asking to identify the set of numbers that are non-altra (i.e., do not overlap). The original question is in Spanish, and the options are numbered A to E. The options are: A) \(x < -3\) B) \(x + 3 > 0\) C) \(1 - x < 7\) D) \(3x > -6\) E) \(-2x < 5\) The original question asks to identify which of the options are non-altra, but the question provided in the explanation does not match the options. Based on the information provided, there seems to be a mismatch between the provided answer options and the question being asked. However, assuming the question is asking which set of numbers is non-altra (does not overlap), I will attempt to reason through this. To determine which set of numbers does not overlap, we need to understand each option. A) \(x < -3\), this is a set of numbers less than -3, which does not overlap with the number 3 and beyond, in other words, it does not overlap with option B. It's notable that option A) \(x < -3\) contains numbers in the set \( x: x \in (-\infty, -3) \), while option B) \( x + 3 > 0 \) contains numbers in the set \( x: x \in (-3, \infty) \). Upon closer analysis, it is clear that option A) and option B) are 2 non-overlapping sets of numbers. We could also perform similar analyses on the remaining options to see if they overlap. However, it is worth mentioning that if the options all were supposed to be seen as `equivalent conditions,' and[((`these 4']( `directions')çõesdo: Parks entire The non-altra concept relates to the concept of interval endpoints. If the endpoints of two ranges don't include the same values or they cross over only within themselves without either being excluded, then the ranges within these intervals are considered non-altra because they overlap completely at one point within their union.* Consequently, if the conditions included within each given option overlapped in their argument-wise form with a different wrapped-we conditional or compound condition outcome within el Zw inputs conditions.
