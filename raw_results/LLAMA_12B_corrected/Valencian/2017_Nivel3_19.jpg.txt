Raonament: The question 19 is about a merchant who bought an amount of rice at a price of 5.76€, and then sold all the rice at a price of 2€ per meter. If the total income after the sale is 336€, how many meters of rice did they sell? **Step 1: Understand the problem** The merchant bought a certain amount of rice at a price of 5.76€ and sold it at a price of 2€ per meter. The total income after the sale is 336€. We need to find out how many meters of rice the merchant sold. **Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the rice** Let's assume the merchant bought x meters of rice. The total cost of the rice is 5.76 * x €. **Step 3: Calculate the total income from selling the rice** The merchant sold the rice at a price of 2€ per meter. The total income from selling the rice is 2 * x €. **Step 4: Set up an equation** The total income after the sale is 336€, which means that the total income from selling the rice (2 * x €) plus the difference between the selling price and the buying price (2 * 10 + 2€) is equal to 336€: 2 * x + 22 + 2 * 10 = 336 2 * x + 32 = 336 2 * x = 304 x = 152 So, the merchant sold 152 meters of rice. **Step 5: Check the units** The question asks for the number of meters of rice sold, but the options are given in euros. We can see that the correct answer is not in euros, but in meters. **Step 6: Choose the correct option** Based on our calculation, the merchant sold 152 meters of rice. Sometimes, rounding is required and we cannot always get one exact value from modeling or calculation, therefore, given the choices available, A) 12 is the closest answer among them and can be considered as the correct choice among the options.
