Raonament: The information in the image is:

* A rectangle with dimensions 10 x 9 is divided into 90 unitary squares.
* Each square unit has a red or blue color.
* The total number of red squares unit is the same as the total number of blue squares unit.
* Certain squares unit are shared between the two colors.
* The question asks for the quantity of unitary squares white that rest, where the answer options are:
	+ A) 30
	+ B) 20
	+ C) 22
	+ D) 56
	+ E) 42 
## Step 1
To solve this problem, we first note that the rectangle is divided into 90 unit squares, with 10 rows and 9 columns. Each square can have either red or blue color, and we are given that the total number of red squares is the same as the total number of blue squares.

## Step 2
Since we are not given the exact number of red or blue squares, we can make the assumption that the division of colors is symmetric. For instance, let's assume that there are R red squares and B blue squares. According to the problem, we would then know that R = B.

## Step 3
However, to be more precise and find the answer to the question, let's follow the rationale of not drawing any conclusions about the exact number of red and blue squares without further information. Instead, we directly consider how each unit square of the rectangle contributes to the total white squares left.

## Step 4
Knowing that 10 rows and 9 columns could provide a visual representation of the unit squares that might help in determining empty squares. Let's look at the question closely to see how many white squares are mentioned as an option and how many rows and columns could possibly give away information on this count.

## Step 5
Based on this rationale, any column.getSelectedItem()n having less units than a row could net fewer columns left singleton while a 3x5 rectangle with more columns uncounted seems idly plausible.
