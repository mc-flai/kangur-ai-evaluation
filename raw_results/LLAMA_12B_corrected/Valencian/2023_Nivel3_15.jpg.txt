Raonament: The information in the question is: A set of 3 transformers is used to treballa totes al mateix ritme, handling a total of 36 p√°ginas in 3 hours. The transformers only need to handle the pages for 30 minutes after another 30-minute feeding period. The question asks for the total number of pages handled by the transformers in total. We have 3 transformers handling 36 pages in 3 hours. This means each transformer handles 12 pages in 3 hours, so each transformer handles 4 pages in 1 hour. The transformers process for 30 minutes after another 30-minute feeding period. This means they process for a total of 60 minutes, which is equivalent to 1 hour. Each transformer will handle 4 pages in 1 hour. So, in 1 hour and 30 minutes, each transformer will handle 6 pages. Three transformers will handle 18 pages in 1 hour and 30 minutes. Adding the initial 18 pages gives a total of 36 pages. Adding the initial 40 minutes also results in an additional 5 pages, so the answer is A) 44. Total pages handled is 36 + 5. First, calculate the number of pages handled in one hour. Since the transformers handle 36 pages in 3 hours, each transformer handles 12 pages in 3 hours, so they handle 4 pages in 1 hour. After 30 minutes more, each transformer handles 6 pages. For three transformers, the total is 18 pages. Adding the initial 36 pages makes 54 pages. Total pages handled is also equal to the initial number of pages, 36. 

Resposta: A)
