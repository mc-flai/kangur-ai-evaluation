Raonament: The conductor can observe a maximum of 9 kilometers at a time. Since 1 kilometer is equal to 6 xífires, the conductor can see 9 x 6 = 54 xífires. Since the format is a 6 xífires by 2 rows, the conductor can see one row of 6 xífires at a time. Therefore, the conductor can only see 6 xífires in the first column or 8 xífires in the last two columns. Considering this, the total xífires that the conductor can see is 8.

Resposta: B)
