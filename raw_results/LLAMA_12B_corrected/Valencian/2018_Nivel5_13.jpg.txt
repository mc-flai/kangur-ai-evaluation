Raonament: The question asks for the dimensions of the caixa segments that will make the cauldron impossible to stir-ho sense doblegar-la in other words, "without bending it". To find the volume of the cauldron, we need to know its dimensions. The dimensions must be in centimeters, and we can use this fact to guide our reasoning. The volume of a rectangular-shaped cauldron is equal to its length multiplied by its width multiplied by its height. In this image, "fer-ho sense doblegar-la" translates to "making it impossible to bend or fold," which implies that the cauldron must have straight sides. Given that one dimension must be 10 cm, this could be the height. For the other two dimensions to be correct, we need them to be examples of possible values for the length and width. Option A) has $2\text{ cm} \times 2\text{ cm}$, but this is too small to be useful. This is not the most practical set of dimensions; however, options B) and D) both offer $\textmixed{2}\text cm$ dimensions, which by itself, could heighten the problem and not expand the solution set. Meanwhile, options C) and E) propose better-scaled values, but we must strictly prioritize those values with the given combinations that their dimensions respond uniquely on.

Resposta: C)
