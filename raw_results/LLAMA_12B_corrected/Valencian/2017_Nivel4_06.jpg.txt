Raonament: The information in the image is: A question with a reading comprehension task in Spanish. The question refers to "96 caramels" and asks about the distribution among Tomás, Pere, and Pilar. The task is to choose the correct answer from the options provided. In this scenario, three persons have 96 caramels to share between themselves. In order to know how many caramels each person has, we divide 96 by 3. 96 ÷ 3 = 32. Therefore, each person would have the same number of caramels, which is 32. However, one option is for each person to have 8 caramels and another is for each person to have 10 caramels. Since there are only 3 persons involved, the number of caramels each person has must be less than or equal to 32. Given the information that the elder mother has given caramels to her elder and younger children, we can deduce that this means she took half of them. 96 ÷ 2 = 48.49... when dividing 96 by 2 we get 48 (integer). The rest is taken into account by the younger children. The total now is 48 + 48 = 96 which is given evenly. 96 caramels have been given by the elder mother to both her children. So, in total, caramels shared between the children would be 48 + 48 and the remainder for the younger children would be equal in number because the total of caramels is 96.
