Raonament: The information in the question is:

* Liam invests 50 ampoules of water worth €1 each.
* He buys the ampoules at a premium of:
	+ 10% in the first 40 months
	+ 40% in the subsequent months
* This premium is initially paid when buying the ampoules.
* He then resells the ampoules at a fixed price (unknown).
* The question asks for the total amount of money Liam received when selling the ampoules. 
## Step 1
Liam has invested in 50 ampoules of water, each worth €1. To determine the total amount of money he will receive from selling the ampoules, we need to calculate the total premium paid for the ampoules.

## Step 2
For the first 40 months, the premium paid is 10% of the initial cost of the ampoules. Therefore, the total premium paid during this period is 10% of 50, which is 5€ (0.1 * 50 = 5). Liam will have to pay this premium in 40 months, so the total premium for this period is 40 * 5 = 200€.

## Step 3
For the subsequent 10 months (since there are 50 ampoules and only 40 months with the 10% premium), the premium paid is 40% of the initial cost of the ampoules, which is 20€ (0.4 * 50 = 20). The total premium for the remaining period is 10 * 20 = 200€.

## Step 4
The total cost of the ampoules, including the premiums, is the sum of the initial cost and the premiums paid. Therefore, the total cost is 50 * 1 + 200 + 200 = 350€.

## Step 5
To find the profit, we need to find out the total costs paid by Liam, which in this case is the amount he spent initially.

## Step 6
So, the total amount of money he would receive is the total cost Liam initially invested in minus his current money to sell those ampoules.

Liam initially invested 50€, to which he had to add the cost of 90€ to sell the ampoules, to get a grand total of 50 + 90 = €100.
