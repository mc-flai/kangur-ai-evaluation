Raonament: The information in the question is:

* Gustau has a crew of 72 reporters on a normal day, but all of them have resigned in the last 10 days. In the last 6 days, he has announced 9 new reporters joining the crew.
* The question asks for an estimate of the number of his native language speaking reporters who have joined in the last 6 days.
* The possible answers are: A) 1, B) 2, C) 3, D) 4, and E) 5. 
## Step 1
Gustau has 72 reporters, but all of them have resigned in the last 10 days. This means that Gustau has 0 native language speaking reporters at the moment.

## Step 2
In the last 6 days, Gustau has announced that 9 new reporters have joined the crew. These 9 reporters are all native language speaking, as it is the only basis for the comparison.

## Step 3
To find the number of new reporters who speak the same language as Gustau, we assume that Gustau is also a native speaker, so the new reporters must also speak the same language. If not, Gustau's language would not be considered.

## Step 5
Hence, since 9 reporters are new and we consider only 1 native language (our own), we can say that all 9 reporters are our native language speakers.

Resposta: B)
