Raonament: The image presents a multiple-choice question in Catalan, a language of Spain. The question pertains to the MCAT cognitive abilities test, of which some sections are administered in bilingual English-Spanish or dual-language format, formerly MCAT-C (Spanish). This question seems relevant to MCAT mining question. The question shown as:

"24. Quants plans passen per almenys tres vèrtexs d'un cub donat?"

Translation into English:

"24. How many planes pass through at least three vertices of a given cube?"

is now valid for today's applications, although the question technically asks for the number of planes passing through at least three vertices of a cube.

As a cube is a set of 8 vertices, when selecting any 3, we are interested in the unique planes that pass through them.

**Methodology** The rationale begins with forming three vertices; this can be done in $\dbinom{8}{3} = 56$ ways. However, since the cube is symmetric (pyramidal), a given plane passes through 12-16 triangles depending on the plane (xyz-oriented).

**Planes of Interest Given each of the four fixed edge symmetry (actually, the same plane of four vertices of the Lemma s(dot)+cube creates three vertices pairs – which we denote only once amongst all these). According to the symmetry, we only need to count by how many cubes we choose any plane we get may have cubevia arrangements:

possible orientations each cube has planar node-pairing counterparts for a given selection;

**Assignments to each s-oriented pair Static Classes**

Treat each s-plane within is selecting, in accordance inclusive or left-dominated edge permutation.
