Raonament: The problem presents a geometric scenario involving a black line with a gradient of increasing slope, alongside a converging outline. Consider the following: By considering all the possible points of crossing and applying the slope concept between two points on lines with a constant gradient, we can deduce the most suitable solution sought by the question. Using reasoning akin to that of "order from slope growth" or "analysis of angles and limits", one can evaluate that the most suitable answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}}$.
