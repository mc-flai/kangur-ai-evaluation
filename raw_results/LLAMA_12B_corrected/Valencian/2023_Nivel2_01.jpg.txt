* A question in Spanish
* The question asks about the smallest number, which when concatenated with the digits of number 13542, produces the number 12345.
* Five answer options are provided: A) 1, B) 2, C) 3, D) 4, and E) 5.
* The question requires the test-taker to reason and select the correct answer from the options provided. 
## Step 1
First, let's break down the problem: we have the number 13542 and need to find the smallest number that when concatenated with its digits forms 12345.

## Step 2
The digits of 13542 are 1, 3, 5, 4, and 2.

## Step 3
To get 12345 by concatenating with the digits of 13542, we need to find the smallest possible number that can be added after 13542.

## Step 4
Considering the digits we have from the original number, 1, 3, 5, 4, and 2, to achieve 12345, the combination should lead to 13543 and end with a 5, which would need to be the extent of any addition.

## Step 5
Given the available choices, any number greater than 0 and less than 5 would not be efficient since adding such a number to the right of the digits wouldnâ€™t reach the correct target (12345).

## Step 6
Among the options provided, option E) 5 is the most logical to concatenate with the digits of 13542 to achieve 12345 in the most efficient manner, as it directly extends the sequence with the necessary digits to achieve the target number.

Resposta: E)
