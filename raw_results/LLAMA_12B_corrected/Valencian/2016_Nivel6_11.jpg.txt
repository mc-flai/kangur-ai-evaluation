Raonament: $$\frac{20}{3}\log 4 = 6 \log 4$$By the log product property, we have:$$\log 4^{\frac{20}{3}} = \log (4^6)$$Since the logarithms have the same base 10, we can equate the arguments:$$4^{\frac{20}{3}} = 4^6$$This is true if and only if the exponents are equal, which they are. Therefore, the expression is equal to \boxed{D) 68\log 2}.
Resposta: D) 68\log 2
