Raonament: The question asks to identify the natural numbers that are both red and green, and then compare the sum of these numbers with the color pot being red or blue. There are numbers with colors other than red and green in the set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. For example, one is red, two is blue, three is green, four is red, etc. Numbers like 5 is red, 6 is green, but numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 are counted for multiple colors (red, blue, green) and so are elevated counts overall. So only counting the explicitly named colors, 6 and 5 have two unique elements. Since the given options ask about the comparison with a "color pot" containing another set of two colors (red or blue), this would not be about counting the numbers themselves (which seems to be the meaning behind the awful phrasing) but rather the possibility of elements fitting into a given measurement. The colors here correspond to either 1 red, 1 green, 1 blue and 5 mixed, and now have only one common defining feature in our case analysis - itself alone in total component makeup Blockly.
