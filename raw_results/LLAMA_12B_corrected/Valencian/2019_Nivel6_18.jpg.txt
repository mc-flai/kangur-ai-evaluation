Raonament: The information in the image is:

* A geometric problem involving four adjacent quadrants with perpendicular diagonals.
* The relationship between the lengths of the diagonals is given as: $a > b$.
* The task is to find the area of the resulting triangle formed by the diagonals' intersection.
* Five answer choices are provided:
	+ A) $\sqrt{ab}$
	+ B) $\frac{1}{2}a^2$
	+ C) $\frac{1}{2}b^2$
	+ D) $\frac{1}{4}(a^2+b^2)$
	+ E) $\frac{1}{2}(a^2+b^2)$ 
## Step 1
First, we need to identify the type of question this is. It's a geometry question that asks for the area of a triangle formed by two lines that meet at a point and create four right-angled triangles with the shortest sides being $a$ and $b$, where $a > b$.

## Step 2
The diagram depicts a pattern or a result that can be derived from another question, but we need to think what that implies. If it does relate directly to solving the question, we must realize that this is aligning only a portion of the entire four-quad quadrants after intersecting them diagonally which add up to $a$ and $b$, thus each piece is related to its segments' halfway.

## Step 3
Now we can think how the dimensions relate to the geometric properties of the problem described. Looking at the given parts we can nicely analyze the height and base of the final rectangle segment to get a reformulation to align with other geometric properties, applying combinations of width and length squares.
