* A math problem is presented in Spanish, asking to find the sum of all integers that are the product of exactly four distinct prime numbers.

**Prime Numbers Mentioned:** 1, 2, 3, and 4.

**Integers Mentioned:** 66660, 133320, 711040, 1422080, and 20 (a single digit number).

**Question:** Which of the integers can be written as a product of the prime numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in exactly four ways? 
## Step 1
First, let's identify the prime numbers given in the question: 1, 2, 3, and 4. It's important to note that 1 does not consider as a prime number in the traditional sense, but for this problem, it's a valid number. However, for the product of primes, it doesn't contribute differently to the count as any other prime would since multiplying by 1 doesn't affect the number of combinations.

## Step 2
Since we need exactly four distinct prime numbers in our product, we have to choose two other numbers from the ones not counting towards our condition (1 is not counted towards the condition of weighing). 4 is a prime number that would not contribute differently because multiplying any number by 4 counts as one way. Thus, we are choosing from the remaining primes (2 and 3), and each and every one of the choices of 1, 2, 3, and 4 affects the possible combinations. The fact that 6 and 4 are factors of our number simplifies the calculation since at least two distinct primes (2 and 3) are guaranteed in any multiplication.

## Step 3
The product of 6 (2 * 3) and 1 (since we are being allowed it here as an extended caseoles) in every one of the responses, we usually expect. Therefore exactly two of our 4 exact prime number count (depending on one). Though it is very frequently estimated; it will make the answer easy quicker-to.

## Step 4
