Raonament: The information in the image is:

* A circle is drawn with points labeled 7, 23, and 30.
* The task is to find the value of the unknown variable n, which is represented by the larger number on the circle.
* The circle has inscribed numbers from l'1 to n, including n, and are ordered and equal spacing along the circumference.
* The diameter of the circle also passes through point 23, and the value of n is unknown.

Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. The circle has inscribed numbers from l'1 to n, including n.
2. The numbers are ordered and equal spacing along the circumference.
3. The diameter of the circle also passes through point 23.
4. The diameter is divided into two halves, and each half is equal to 23 (since the diameter also passes through point 7).

Now, let's look at the options:

A) 30: If the diameter is divided into two halves, and each half is equal to 23, then the total diameter would be 46. The largest inscribed number would be 47 (n = 47), but we don't have this option. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.

B) 32: Similarly, if the diameter is divided into two halves, and each half is equal to 32, then the total diameter would be 64. The largest inscribed number would be 65 (n = 65), but we don't have this option. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.

C) 34: Again, if the diameter is divided into two halves, and each half is equal to 34, then the total diameter would be 68. The largest inscribed number would be 69 (n = 69), but we don't have this option. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.

D) 36 : If the diameter is divided into two halves, and each half is equal to 36, then the total diameter would be 72. The largest inscribed number would be 73 (n = 73). Wait, we have this option!

E) 38 : Similarly, if the diameter is divided into two halves, and each half is equal to 38, then the total diameter would be 76. The largest inscribed number would be 77 (n = 77), but we don't have this option. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.

Resposta: D)
