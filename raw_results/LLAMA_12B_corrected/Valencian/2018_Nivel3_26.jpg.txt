Raonament: The Simpsons is a popular American animated sitcom that has been on the air for over three decades. Created by Matt Groening, the show has become a cultural phenomenon, known for its witty humor, satire, and lovable characters. To answer the question, we need to identify the characters who haven't appeared in the finals, or in other words, who were eliminated early in the competition. The correct answer will be the characters who have not been mentioned in the options. Let's examine each option: A) Marge i Homer - These characters are likely to be included in the finals as they are main characters in the show and have appeared in numerous episodes. B) Marge i Krusty - Krusty is a main character and a comedian, so it's unlikely that he would be eliminated early on. C) Krusty i Bart - Bart is a main character and a prankster, so he's unlikely to be eliminated early on. D) Marge i Edna - Edna is a recurring character and a love interest for Homer, so it's unlikely that she would be eliminated early on. E) Krusty i Lisa - Lisa is a main character and a genius, so she's unlikely to be eliminated early on. Given the options, the correct answer is the one where we select two characters who have not been mentioned in the show, or more specifically, the one that includes a character who is not a main cast member and is not known for being in the competition. Considering that Bart is known for his pranks and is a main character, and Marge is a main character and a wife of Homer, it is unlikely that they would be eliminated early on. On the other hand, Krusty is a comedian and a main character, and Lisa is a genius and a main character, so they are unlikely to be eliminated early on. The correct answer is: B) Marge i Krusty **RaonamentBF**: Eliminem primer Bart i Lisa, jaque ja amb la mismo cap a ser semifinalists. Llavors tornem cap al mogador i escrivim 2 vegades Marge i mostreem 2 vegades que a vegada is mon ça S Kurt. Diu que en a introducció es veu a Marge i Krusty donant la tomba amb Kathryn Griffin. Per tant la respost es C) Krusty i Bart, xúcs?
