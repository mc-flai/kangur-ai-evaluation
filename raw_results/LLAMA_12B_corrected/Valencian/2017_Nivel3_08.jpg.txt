Raonament: To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the street and the relationship between the cousin's house and my house. The statement mentions that I live in the last house on the even side, which is house 12. It also mentions that my cousin lives in the last house on the odd side. To determine which number the cousin's house has, we need to verify that his house is on the odd side of the street and consider the starting point for the street number. Since the starting point is 12 and my house is the 12th even-numbered house, we can infer that the last odd-numbered house would be the one after the even-numbered houses that my cousin hasn't mentioned. This means we count 13, 15, etc., but my cousin lives in the last one on the odd side. Given that the last even-numbered house is 12 and that there are equal numbers of odd and even houses if counting in an ordered manner affects the overall, my cousin's house should be indicated by counting odd endwards from the even side in a manner similar to A, B, D, E in scenarios as opposite sides, making the last odd typically but in sequence. The next will be double the available premises avoiding reconsider in pair chains. Therefore, considering the above information and assuming equal distance (one house, 13 likely half of the odd from previous side pairing summing sequentially pictured starting counting directional judgment due their sequencing)onlyca factor starting logically the variation one>,Crowedingonepointier one
