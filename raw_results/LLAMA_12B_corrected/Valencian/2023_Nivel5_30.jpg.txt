Raonament: The question provided is in Spanish, but I will analyze it carefully and provide a step-by-step approach to the solution. The question states that if $f(xy) = f(x + y)$ for all $x$ and $y$, then when $f(9) = 18$, what is the value of $f(2020)$? Since $f(xy) = f(x + y)$, we can conclude that the function is $f(x) = x^2$, because it satisfies the given condition: $f(xy) = (xy)^2 = x^2 + y^2 = f(x + y)$. Now that we know the function is $f(x) = x^2$, we can find the value of $f(2020)$ by substituting $x = 2020$ into the function: $f(2020) = 2020^2 = 2020 \cdot 2020 = 204^2 \cdot 10^3 = 4096 \cdot 1000 + 204^2 = 4096000 \cdot \frac{101}{100} = 40960000 \cdot \frac{201}{200} = 204^2 \cdot 101 = 102400000 + 220000 \text{mod } 5000 = 102300000 \text{mod } 5000 = 20240000 + 100$. We can check that $f(9) = 9^2 = 81 = 18 \text{mod } 18$, and $f(2020) = 2020^2 = 400300100 \text{mod } 18 \cdot 5000 = 102-quote 20quote201->40033000 \ n the contrast defined-overlaymed=con graph for-meter1re%.+conversion)
