Raonament: To find the answer, we need to count the number of friends in the circle. Since Aitana is the fifth person in line after Laia (from the left) and the sixth person after the left of Laia, there must be 5 people before Aitana and 3 people after Aitana, including Laia. This means there are 5 + 3 + 1 (Laia) = 9 people in the circle. However, one of the options (E) is greater than this. Since we are counting the number of people, including Laia, the correct number of people in the circle would be greater than 9. Let's check if any of the choices give the correct number. Let's re-count the number of friends: Since Aitana is in the fifth position after Laia, there must be 5 people before Aitana and Laia is a separate person, so the total number of people before Aitana and Laia is 6. The number of people after Aitana would be the same as the number of people before Aitana plus 1, which is 6 + 1 = 7. The total number of people in the circle would be 7 + 6 = 13. The correct answer is 13 friends in total.  
Resposta: D) 13
