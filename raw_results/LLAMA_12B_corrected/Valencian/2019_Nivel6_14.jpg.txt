Raonament: The problem describes a situation where three men, Aleix, Baltasar, and Carles, pass each other every day without entering or leaving the door, window, or passageway. This situation implies that we're looking for an answer that involves the movement or interaction of these men. Option A) Aleix i Baltasar seems to indicate a situation where it's only Aleix and Baltasar who pass each other, which doesn't exclude Carles from passing them as well. Option B) Aleix focuses only on Aleix, which might mean he passes someone but the wording could make it unclear if it's Baltasar, Carles, both, or none. Option C) Aleix, Baltasar i Carles directly states that all three men pass each other, which is consistent with the problem statement that specifies all three but does not restrict their interaction to just the two options given. Option D) Ni Aleix ni Baltasar suggests both Aleix and Baltasar do not pass each other, which contradicts the given situation. Option E) Baltasar specifically mentions Baltasar, which is one of the men and could be correct in some form but is overly specific and might not necessarily be directly linked to the passingsace described. 

Resposta: C)
