Raonament: The information in the question is:

* The problem is related to a situation where a baby elevator ascends only in ascending order.
* There are a maximum of 12 adult and 18 infant passengers that can be on board at the same time.
* The question asks which number of infants pushed into the elevator with 8 adults would exceed the maximum capacity of the elevator.
* The options for the number of infants that could be added to the elevator with 8 adults are: A) 5, B) 6, C) 7, D) 8, and E) 12. 
## Step 1
First, we need to understand the maximum capacity of the elevator, which is 12 adults or 18 infants. Since there are 8 adults in the elevator now, the remaining capacity for adults is 12 - 8 = 4 adults.

## Step 2
Next, we need to determine how many infants can be added along with the 8 adults without exceeding the total capacity of 18 infants.

## Step 3
If we add more than 2 infants with the 8 adults, it will exceed the total capacity of 10 (2 infants + 8 adults), but that's not the question. We need to find what would maximize the number of infants without adding adults.

## Step 4
The question is how many infants can be added to the 8 adults without exceeding the maximum capacity. If 8 infants are already counting as 18, the maximum number of infants without exceeding the capacity would be 18 - 8 = 10.

Resposta: C)
