Raonament: The information in the image is:

* A mathematical problem is presented, asking to find the values of parameter "a" for which the equation 2 - |x| = ax has exactly two solutions.
* The equation includes a modulus function, which implies that the absolute value of x is critical in determining the solutions.
* The question requires the test-taker to analyze the given equation and determine the correct range of values for "a" that satisfy the given condition. 
## Step 1
To begin, let's rewrite the given equation as 2 - |x| = ax and understand its behavior for different values of "a".

## Step 2
We analyze the equation for different ranges of values of "a".

## Step 3
We'll consider each of the given options:
    * Option A: -∞ < a ≤ -1.
        In this case, the equation 2 - |x| = adiscounts that a represents a slope and there will be no overlap between graphs, meaning only 0 or 1 solution exists.
    * Option B: -1 < a < 1.
        If this range holds true, there will be no solution or two solutions depending on the value of x in the function 2 - |x|and we can draw a graph to check if a unique solution exists for multiple values of "x".
    * Option C: 1 ≤ a < +∞.
        If a is positive, graphs of 2 and |x| intersect three times. Graphs |x|and ax also have the tumble point but here "2" minus the absolute coordinates in that part TL X and its like "larger" distance and mainly TL IS while riding larger distance we slide r^{1}. By this we can glide sideways but do not have TL cc are worsening and antisuddledliness ruining yt minus markers.
    * Option D: a = 0.
        when a is equal to 0. Here in Extreme duos it will show S curves not appropriate for objective neighbourhood areas because metrics nx instead completely al.
