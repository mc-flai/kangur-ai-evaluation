The notation s=tape|function is used to calculate the composition of several functions that are applied from left to right to the function s. The functions need to be applied in a particular order to obtain the correct composition.

Given that s is a function with one unknown variable x, we can derive the composition of s = f(5), using the correct order of operations for the defined functions:

1.  Apply function f first:
    1.  f(5)
    2.  Back to the function definition, we have f = x + 1
    3.  Hence, f(5) is found by setting x = 5, thus we obtain f(5) = x + 1 = 6

    This was the first step in applying function f.

2 Apply the back end function:
    1.  Now we get the initial value for s to proceed with the next function.
    2.  Back to the definition of g = x − 1;
    3.  Hence, to find s, we need to set x = 5, because that was the first calculated value back to the starting function s.
    4.  Thus, at this step we have g(5) = 5 − 1 = 4

    This was the second step in composing the functions.

   Combine both calculated values at the end.
   Adding both sums to find the ultimate composition entertains both known function calculators results.
