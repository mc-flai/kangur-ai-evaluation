Raonament: First, we need to understand the situation. The person walks to a meeting point at a speed of 2 km/h and covers 3 km. Then, they start walking at a speed of 4 km/h towards a destination. We can calculate the time it takes to cover 3 km at a speed of 2 km/h. Time = Distance / Speed = 3 km / 2 km/h = 1.5 hours. Next, we need to determine the remaining distance that the person has to cover after the meeting point. Since they are walking at the same location for the meeting, the distance from the meeting point to the starting point of the meeting spot is 3 km. Therefore, the total distance from the starting point to the destination is 3 km (from the park to the meeting point) + the distance from the meeting point to the destination = 4 km. The time it takes to cover 4 km at a speed of 4 km/h is 4 km / 4 km/h = 1 hour. The total time to cover the distance at the speeds of 2 km/h and 4 km/h is 1.5 hrs + 1 hr = 2.5 hours. Now, we can calculate the fraction of the total time spent walking to cover a distance of 4 km/h. The time to cover 4 km at 4 km/h is 1 hour out of the total time of 2.5 hours. So, the fraction of the total time is 1 / 2.5 = 2 / 5.
