Raonament: The question is asking for the sum of the natural numbers from 1 to n, where n is an unknown number. This sum is known to be equal to a certain three-digit number, which is unknown. The sums of natural numbers can be calculated using the formula: sum = n*(n+1)/2. We are given a few possible sums of natural numbers: 38, 36, 39, 35, and 37. We need to find the one that matches this sum. Using the formula from step 2, we calculate the possible sums of natural numbers. Only the number 36 gives a result of 21, it matches neither 38, 39, 35, nor 37 but 21 + 10 + 5 = 36.

Resposta: B)
