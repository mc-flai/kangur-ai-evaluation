* The task is to choose the correct option.

The question asks about the sum of the divisors of 1024 and its product. We need to find the value of `b` that satisfies this condition.

The sum of divisors of `n` is denoted by `σ(n)` and the product of divisors of `n` is denoted by `π(n)`. We need to find `a` such that `σ(1024) + π(1024) = b`.

First, let's calculate the sum and product of divisors of 1024:

- `σ(1024)`: The divisors of 1024 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 1024. The sum of these divisors is `σ(1024) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 1024 = 1535`.
- `π(1024)`: The divisors of 1024 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 1024. The product of these divisors is `π(1024) = exp(5 \* (1 + 1)) = exp(2 \* 5) = 1024`.

Now, we need to find `a` such that `1535 + 1024 = b`. Therefore, `a` equals `1559` in order to be able to get `1333` from `a^5 + 1`.
