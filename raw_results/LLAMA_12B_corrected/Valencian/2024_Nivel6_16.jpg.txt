Raonament: The figure shows a quadrilateral with certain points labeled, and we are asked to determine the length of segment AB. The side lengths a, b, and c represent the differences in longitude between consecutive vertices, and the expression Ah, drawn to the left of the picture, is the triangle labeled ABu. It seems likely that the length of AB will be related to a, b, and c, and so we start by exploring triangle ABu in order to find a relevant expression for AB. In particular, if we examine the equation relating the arcs to the chords in the triangle, we obtain an expression for AB derived from ABu. Since the expression is correct for the relevant lengths of a, b, and c, we conclude that the indicated expression for AB yields the desired result.
