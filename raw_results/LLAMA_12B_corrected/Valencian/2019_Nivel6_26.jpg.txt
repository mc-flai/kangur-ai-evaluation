Raonament: The problem presented in the image is a multiple-choice question asking how many integers $n$ have a property expressed in Spanish. The property, when translated, states that the modulus of $n^2-2n-3$ is a prime number.

To solve this, we first need to factorize the expression $n^2-2n-3$ using the quadratic formula or by inspection. By inspection, we can factor it as $(n-3)(n+1)$.

Now, we need to determine the values of $n$ for which $(n-3)(n+1)$ is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

The modulus of $(n-3)(n+1)$ will be prime if and only if $(n-3)$ or $(n+1)$ is 1 or -1. This happens when $n-3=\pm1$ or $n+1=\pm1$. Solving for $n$, we get $n=4$ or $n=2$.

Therefore, the property holds for two values of $n$, which are 4 and 2.
