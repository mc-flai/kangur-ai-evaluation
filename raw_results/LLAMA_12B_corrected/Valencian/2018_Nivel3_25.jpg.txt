Raonament: The hexagon is formed by connecting the centers of six circles that are tangent to each other. This forms a regular hexagon. We can see that each side of the hexagon is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is twice the radius. So, each side is equal to $2 \times \frac{1}{3}=\frac{2}{3}$. We know that the perimeter of the hexagon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since there are six equal sides, the perimeter will be $6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4$. However, this answer is not among the given options. We need to check if there is any misinterpretation of the question or the given information. Upon reviewing the question again, we realize that the initial hexagon's measure cost was actually asking about the length of the boundary formed by connecting the centers of the zombie circles. This boundary seems to be composed of two types of lines: segments connecting the centers of circles and lines formed by the radii. By measuring the distance between the centers of any two adjacent circles, we find it to be $\sqrt{(\frac{1}{3})^2+(-\frac{1}{3})^2} = \frac{\sqrt{7}}{3}$. Given six such segments form a regular hexagon, thus segmenting the perimeter into 6 corners situated equidistant from the center and radio/d.
