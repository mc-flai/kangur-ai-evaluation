Raonament: The question 13 is a Spanish language question. But the sum can be solved using any language: Spanish or English. To solve this sum, use the following steps: Equals on both sides: –> 99 balcons = 50 % of 150 people, 50 % =çek q2 = 50 ×100 / 100 = 0,50 × 150 q2 = 75. If we equal the two sides, we will see that all quantities align at the same level. –> 99 balloons balance 50% of the people –> 99 balloons balance 75%. Now we can calculate: 99 balloons = 50% of 150 people = 75 people = (99 balloons). So, doubling of balloons will lead to doubling of the people which is incorrect. * Doubling of 75 people = 150 people. * Doubling of 99 ballons = 198 balloons. So in order to balance 150 people need 198 balloons. So if you have one size of people which is 150 you must choose: C) 38. However, since that C = Response is A) 99, so The correct answer is blocking between.
