Raonament: The information in the image is:

* A point $P$ is located at coordinates $(2,-1)$.
* The point $P$ is represented by the equation of a line in the form $ax + by = c$.
* The task is to identify the possible cases that determine the values of $a, b,$ and $c$ for this line.
* Five options (A, B, C, D, E) are provided, each listing different possible values of $a, b,$ and $c$.

Building on the equation $ax + by = c$, with $P(2, -1)$, we substitute the coordinates of $P$ into the equation. This gives us the equation:

$$2a - b = c$$

Since the question asks which case(s) is/are not possible, we need to examine the options to determine if there is a unique solution for $a$, $b$, and $c$ within each option.

A) $a = -1, b = 1, c = -3$:
- The equation for A is $-x + y = -3$.
- This option gives us a line with $a$, $b$, and $c$ values, satisfying the condition.

$\implies$ A) is a valid case.

B) $a = 1, b = 0, c = 2$:
- The equation for B is $x = 2$ (not an $ax + by = c$ format, but a specific case).
- This represents a vertical line through $x=2$. In the given format, it does not represent $ax + by = c$ properly, as it lacks a specific relation between $a$, $b$, and $c$ in the general form when $b=0$. It fits the space, but technically, B) needs $a=1$, considered as part of a scalar, leading to a vacuous selection here ("invalid" as a solution doesn't fit well in line equation problem due its constant nature).

C) $a = 0, b = 3, c = -3$:
- This translates to $y = -1$ (a simple vertical line, but in $ax+by=c$ form, it incorrectly suggests $3x = -3$, violating the initial assumption).
- Fails the verification (incorrect $a$, not correspondent $b$ and $c$, distractively representing $3x = -3$.
