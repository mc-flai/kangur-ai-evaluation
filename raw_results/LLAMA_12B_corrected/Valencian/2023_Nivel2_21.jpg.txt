Raonament: The information in the image is: A rectangular plot of pèsols (peas) is cultivated between two other rectangular plots of maduixes (strawberries). The total width of the plot of maduixes is 3 meters. The total area of pèsols is 15 m^2. We need to find the width of the plot of pèsols given that the overall length is 3 meters and the area of pèsols is 15 m^2. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its width by its length. We know the area is 15 m^2 and let's denote the width of the pèsols as x. However, we also need to take into account the total width, which is 3 meters. Given the shape and arrangement of the plots, the total length of the pèsols section must be half of the overall width because the plot is divided evenly between pèsols and maduixes. Therefore, the width of the pèsols section must take half of the total width, which means the pèsols section width is 3 / 2 = 1.5 meters. Using the area formula, we can set up an equation: x * (1.5) = 15. Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 1.5.
