Raonament: For each layer of the structure, the number of cubes increases by one as we move from bottom to top. The top layer is a 2 by 2 square, so it requires 4 cubes. The middle layer is a 3 by 3 square, so it requires 9 cubes. The bottom layer is a 4 by 4 square, so it requires 16 cubes. Thus, the total number of cubes is 4 + 9 + 16 = 29. However, each cube in the top layer is shared with two smaller cubes on both sides, but we should not count this shared portion, so we only count the top layer with 4 cubes. Hence, the total number of cubes needed is 4 + 9 + 16 = 29.
