Raonament: The information in the question is:

* The question is about determining the age of Anna, Bea, and Carlos, and their relationship to one another.
* The information given includes:
	+ Anna and Bea are 17 and 15 years older than Carlos, respectively.
	+ The arithmetic mean of Anna's and Bea's ages is 15 years.
## Step 1
First, let's understand the given information. Anna and Bea are 17 and 15 years older than Carlos, respectively. This implies that their ages are 17 + C and 15 + C, where C represents Carlos' age.

## Step 2
The arithmetic mean of Anna's and Bea's ages is given as 15 years. The formula for the arithmetic mean is the sum of the values divided by the number of values. In this case, since there are two ages, the mean can be expressed as (17 + C + 15 + C) / 2 = 15.

## Step 3
To simplify the equation, we can combine like terms: (32 + 2C) / 2 = 15. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives 32 + 2C = 30. Subtracting 32 from both sides yields 2C = 30 - 32, which simplifies to 2C = -2.

## Step 4
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives C = -2 / 2, which means C = -1. However, since the ages cannot be negative, there seems to be a mistake in the calculation or interpretation.

## Step 5
Let's correct the calculation by reassessing the relationship given by the mean: Except for the sign mistake earlier, correctly solving the calculation gives a positive average. The actual correct step for solving the mean equation was to combine like terms correctly and solve for C with the correct arithmetic.

## Step 6
Revisiting the original mean calculation: ((17 + C) + (15 + C)) / 2 = 15. Simplifying gives (32 + 2C) / 2 = 15. This simplifies further to 32 + 2C = 30, making it 2C = 30 - 32, which actually should be a process resulting
