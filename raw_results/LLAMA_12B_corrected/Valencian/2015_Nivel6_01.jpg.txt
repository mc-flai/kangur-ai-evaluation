Raonament: The image shows a math question in Spanish, asking the test taker to identify the number of real solutions of a given quadratic equation. This equation has a discriminant of: D = b^2 - 4ac. Let's analyze each option to determine the number of real solutions. Initialize variables a = 1, b = 2014, and c = 2015. Compute discriminant D = 2014^2 - 4(1)(2015) D = 4,056,876 Since D > 0, there are two distinct real solutions.
