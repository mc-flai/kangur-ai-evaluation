Raonament: The information in the image is:

* A question with five multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D, and E)
* The question is about the number of games played by a team on its way to a world championship
* The team played 56 games, but the quantities of games played in different competitions are not specified
* The answer choices are:
	+ A) 64 games
	+ B) 72 games
	+ C) 120 games
	+ D) 240 games
	+ E) 256 games 
The question mentions that a team played 56 matches to win the world championship, and 16 of those matches were against another team that also played in the championships. It is also mentioned that if that team had only played against everyone except that one team, they would have played mass amounts less games and would not have been so successful.

With this information, we can infer that the other 16 matches cannot be against the team mentioned in the question because it would not have played as much and would not have been as successful.

Therefore, it is safe to assume that the 56 games are the total number of games against all other teams in the competition. 
Now we need to calculate the total number of games played

From all other teams the team would play, let's say A, would play a total of T games. Then the total number of games = T + A + B + C + D would be played total, but not 56. 

Hence it would be safe to assume that the 64 games given in option A, should be real games played.

Resposta: A)
