Raonament: A math question is provided, which asks about the range between two-thirds and half. The range is denoted as 3 : 2. The task is to determine whether the range can be expressed as the minimum of a multiple of a chosen divisor and its maximum value when divided by that divisor. Five possible options are provided: A) 1.5, B) 2, C) 3, D) 6, and E) No es pot saber. No additional context or information is provided. First, we need to understand the range 3 : 2. This range means we are looking for a ratio of division that gives us a result in this range. Given that the ratio is 3 : 2, it implies we are dividing 3 parts by 2 parts. So, we are essentially looking for a division that translates to this ratio. The question asks if we can reach this range by dividing a number by the smallest integer with which the result is maximized when that same integer is used as a divisor of the largest possible multiple that equals the highest number of the range. To determinate whether this is possible, we can calculate the division for several integers as divisors to check which one gives us the highest result closest to our range when applied to a multiple. Selecting a smaller divisor to start with like 2 or 3 is reasonable. However, this problem could also be approached by calculating the center point of the range and finding a divisor that closely matches this value under division. Considering option B) 2 as a divisor and applying it to the highest multiple in the given range (6 * 2 = 12), we divide 6 by 2 to see if we surprisingly get our 3:2 range. Out of the given options, finding a divisor that gives a result matching our expected range is the task.

Resposta: B)
