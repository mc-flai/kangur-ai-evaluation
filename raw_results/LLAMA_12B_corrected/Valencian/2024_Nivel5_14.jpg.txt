Raonament: First, let's clarify the information given in the question. The question mentions that "La filla de Maria ha tingut hui una xiqueta," which is a statement in Catalan and translates to "Mary's daughter had a girl today." This indicates that Mary's sister has had a child. However, it's unclear what this information has to do with the mathematical problem, which involves calculating the product of two numbers (presumably the ages of two different individuals) and deciding how many times this product needs to be multiplied by 2024. Given the numbers $42 \times 48 \times n = 2024$, we can divide both sides by $\boxed{2016}$ to get the final answer. Solving $2016 \times n = 2024 \div 42 \times 48$, we arrive at the denominator. So our final answer is $1 \div 2016 = 0.00049375$, but that is incorrect as we answered n = 1. The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$
