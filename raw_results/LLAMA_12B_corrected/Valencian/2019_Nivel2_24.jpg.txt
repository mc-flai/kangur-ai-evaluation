Raonament: The image presents a question from a multiple-choice test. The test is in Spanish, but the process of deducing a correct answer can still be based on logical reasoning and factual knowledge.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The question states that there is an animal, called a "bosky," which is used as a camp mascot for children. It further provides a quote from a group of participants regarding their belief in the bosky's ability to have knowledge of the amount of prosody (rocks) in the camp.

**Step 2: Identify Key Information**
The question asks us to choose the correct response regarding the number of boskies mentioned in the quote.

**Step 3: Analyze Options**
Each option presents a different number: A) 3, B) 4, C) 6, D) 7, and E) 8.

**Step 4: Eliminate Incorrect Options**
There is no specific information provided to directly eliminate any options based on the quote, so we must consider the broader implications of the question and the context in which it's given.

**Step 5: Deduce a Correct Answer**
Given the nature of the question and the requirement for logical reasoning, the correct answer is not explicitly deducible from mere knowledge transfer. However, since the instructions imply a logical approach should be followed, and considering that boskies are not real entities but rather figures of imagination used in camps, it seems there was an attempt at a trick question or a misunderstanding in translation or premise.

**Conclusion**
Given the lack of information to make a factual deduction about the number of boskies and the nature of the question as presented, the option that best aligns with a logical deduction is E) 8, but this conclusion is based more on the structure of the problem and the lack of specificity in the quote about the number of boskies.

Resposta: E) 8
