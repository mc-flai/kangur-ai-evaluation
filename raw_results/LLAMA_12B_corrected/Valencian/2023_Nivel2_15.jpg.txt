Raonament: The information in the image is:

* A question in Spanish
* The question asks to organize groups of four numbers, from 1 to 12, in a way that the numbers in each group always differ by either 1 or 2 units.
* The groups are labeled A to E, each containing four numbers: A) 5, 6; B) 10, 9; C) 6, 7; D) 8, 10; and E) 4, 3.
* The numbers in each group are in a different order. 
## Step 1
Consider the first option, A) 5 i 6. The numbers in this pair differ by 1, which meets the criteria.

## Step 2
Look at the pair in B) 10 i 9. This pair also differs by 1, meeting the criteria.

## Step 3
For C) 6 i 7, the numbers differ by 1, which fits the criteria.

## Step 4
Consider D) 8 i 10. While the difference between 8 and 10 is 2, which meets the criteria, a more strategic option exists to differentiate between units of 1 and 2.

## Step 5
For E) 4 i 3, the difference is 1, meeting the criteria.

## Step 6
Upon reviewing, the strategy in D) doesn't differentiate as strategically as C due to its intermediate number and its difference.

## Step 7
Between A, B, and C, the arrangement that seems to fit and doesn't use the same numbers more than once or in a way not meeting the 1 or 2 unit difference, is just these three as they fulfill the criteria without overusing numbers.

## Step 8
Choose between the valid options listed that have 3 examples meeting the criteria perfectly and strategic usage upheld.

Resposta: D)
