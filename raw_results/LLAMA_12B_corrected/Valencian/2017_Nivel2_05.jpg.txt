Raonament: You need to start by finding the number of prunes each person has and then adding them together. Carla has 9 prunes, Aitana has 14 prunes, and Dani has 28 prunes. You can then add these numbers together to find the total, which is 51 prunes. However, none of the options match this total. The closest option is 46, which would be 5 fewer than the actual total of 51. 

Resposta: No Answer.
