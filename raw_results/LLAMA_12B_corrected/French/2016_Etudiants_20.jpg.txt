Raisonnement: The question asks for the length of the initial paper strip. By drawing the figure, we can deduce the length, which is $X+4$. The triangle PQR has angles A, B and C. Angles A and B are equal to 45 degrees since the trapezes are isosceles and its sides are equal. We have an altitude from P to QR which is 4 cm and we know the hypotenuse is 8. Using this we obtain

$$\tan 45=\frac{3-4}{8} \implies 8-3=4 \implies X=5.$$

Hence, the length of the initial paper strip is 5+4=9 cm. The correct answer is (D) 58 cm.

Model-answering by drawing the figure and computing the necessary values led to the solution. Therefore, the corresponding answer is **D) 15**.

RÃ©ponse: D) 15
