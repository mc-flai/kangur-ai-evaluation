Raisonnement: The question is designed to determine how to change at least one piece of Sam's grid to match the other grid.  

- Option A) 
   - If Sam changes one square from his grid to the other grid, it has the same color as the two remaining squares. This way, he avoided losing his grid or getting a grid that is two squares apart. It is therefore a valid response. 

- Option B)
   - If Sam changes one square from his grid to the other grid, it has the opposite color of the two remaining squares in the grid. The two remaining squares on the altered side will remain on the same side. Hence, Sam will not have to change squares again as it has created uniformity from both grids. It is therefore a valid response.

- L'Option C)
   - If Sam changes one square from his grid to the other grid, he will have two squares on the same side (same color). The other square on the altered grid will then indicate a uniform change of at least two squares. Thus, this option is not valid.

- L'Option D)
   - If Sam modifies a square on his grid to the other grid, he will have on the grid modified a square that is the same color as one of the other squares in the grid. However, the second square at the other end is still opposite the other unchanged square. Sam will still have squares at least two grid units evolutionary. Therefore, this is not an option.

L'Option E )
   - If Sam changes a square on his grid to the other grid, he will have created squares at least two grid units evolutionary. No longer have a grid that matches all squares without changing square n in its squares. Hence, this is not one of the options.

RÃ©ponse: A)
