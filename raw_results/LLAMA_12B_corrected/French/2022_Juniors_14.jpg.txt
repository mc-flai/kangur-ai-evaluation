Raisonnement: The question asks us to determine the number of trees that can fit in a rectangular park with a single tree as a base. To solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between the number of trees and the dimensions of the park. Since the park is rectangular, we can assume that the number of trees that can fit inside it depends on the area of the park. Let's consider each option: A) 1: This option suggests that only one tree can fit in the park. However, since the park is rectangular, we can fit multiple trees along its length and width. B) 2: This option implies that two trees can fit in the park. This is possible if the park has a large enough area to accommodate two trees, but it's not clear if this is the case without more information. C) 3: This option suggests that three trees can fit in the park. This is also possible if the park has a sufficiently large area to accommodate three trees. D) 4: This option implies that four trees can fit in the park. Similar to option B, this is possible if the park has an adequate area, but it's not clear if this is the case without more information. E) 5: This option suggests that five trees can fit in the park. This is possible if the park has an even larger area to accommodate five trees. Without additional information about the dimensions of the park, we cannot determine the exact number of trees that can fit inside it. However, based on the fact that the park is rectangular and can accommodate multiple trees, we can infer that options B, C, D, and E are plausible. Since we have multiple plausible options, we need to look for additional clues in the figure. Let's examine the provided image show in the prompt.
