Raisonnement: The question asks to determine the length of segment KL.

To resolve this question, we will follow step-by-step instructions : 

1. An **entire circle** is attributed to segment KL. We already know that this integer part is 2.

2. The total radius of the circle half with segment KL is divided by half of the radius of the small circle:

$$\frac{9\pi/2}{\pi/2}=9$$

The angle corresponding to 30 units on the circumference is therefore :

$$\theta \times 30 = 9\pi \Rightarrow \theta = \frac{\pi}{3}$$

3. The total length is obtained by dividing the number of units representing the center of the circle by the trigonometric function, arccosette approximatively, $0.906$.
