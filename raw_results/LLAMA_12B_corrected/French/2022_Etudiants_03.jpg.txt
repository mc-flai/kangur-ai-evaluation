Raisonnement: The question is asking for the sum of the first 15 inner numbers in a sequence. To get the desired answer from the options, convert each choice into a fraction and substitute each option into the sum 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + ... + n_squares^2. This shows A) = 5.08; B) = 4.9; C) = 5.2; D) = 4.07 and E) = 5.07, which are correct successively but the last and fourth successively has the incorrect value. Note: n_squares = the sum of squares from 1 to 15  = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + ... + 15^2 = 1240. Final Answer: The final answer is C) = 5.2.  
RÃ©ponse: C)
