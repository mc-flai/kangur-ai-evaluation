Raisonnement: The question is asking for the length of a cable. We're given that a 76-meter long cable has been divided into three different three-meter lengths. We need to determine which option is the longest. To do this, we can compare the lengths of the three three-meter pieces and see how they compare to the given lengths of the other options. Let's break it down: *   Option A: 34 meters *   Option B: 35 meters *   Option C: 36 meters *   Option D: 37 meters *   Option E: 38 meters Since the cable was divided into three three-meter pieces, the total length of these pieces would be 3 x 3 = 9 meters. This means that the remaining length of the cable would be 76 - 9 = 67 meters. Now, let's compare this remaining length to the given options: *   Option A: 34 meters (less than the remaining length) *   Option B: 35 meters (less than the remaining length) *   Option C: 36 meters (less than the remaining length) *   Option D: 37 meters (more than the remaining length) *   Option E: 38 meters (more than the remaining length) Not et dépassant le longueur des trois morceaux de façon différente, B et C sont donc les options les plus longs. Le second plus long morceau de quelle longueur)? Plus long dans les deux cas, 35 est le plus long et 36 est le second plus long. Donc C) 36 est la réponse.

Réponse: C)
