Raisonnement: The question asks for the total weight of the chocolate candy in both jars. **Step 1**: Calculate the weight of the chocolate candy in each jar. *   Jar 1: 9 chocolates = 9 x (63g) = 567g *   Jar 2: 12 chocolates = 12 x (54g) = 648g **Step 2**: Add the weights of the chocolate candy in both jars to find the total weight. 567g + 648g = 1215g However, since the question mentions that there are two jars of chocolate candy, we must add the weight of the jars themselves to the total weight. The weight of each jar is not given, so we cannot calculate the total weight of the chocolate candy without knowing the total weight of the jars. **Conclusion**: Without the weight of the jars, we cannot determine the total weight of the chocolate candy in both jars. Therefore, we cannot choose from the options provided.
