Raisonnement: The question is asking for the measure of angle MLO in degrees.

To solve this problem, I will first analyze the given information and look for any relevant geometric properties or theorems that can help me find the measure of angle MLO.

The given information is:

* KLMN est un carré (KLMN is a square)
* Le triangle équilatéral KOM tel que le sommet L soit à l'intérieur du triangle (The equilateral triangle KOM with vertex L inside the triangle)

Since KLMN is a square, all its sides are equal, and all its angles are right angles (90 degrees). Therefore, angle KML is 90 degrees.

Now, let's consider the equilateral triangle KOM. Since it is an equilateral triangle, all its angles are equal, and each angle measures 60 degrees. Therefore, angle KMO is 60 degrees.

Since angle KMO is 60 degrees, the angle MLO must be 120 degrees to form a straight line (KLO).

Therefore, the measure of angle MLO is 120 degrees.
