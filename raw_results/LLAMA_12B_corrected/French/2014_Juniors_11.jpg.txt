Raisonnement: The question asks to determine the coordinates of the other extremity of the diagonal of a rectangle. Assuming the standard coordinates form (x; y) as in the question, knowing the first point is (-1; 0), and the second point is (5; 0), the difference appears to be 6, resulting in (5 - (-1) = 6). The rectangle is aligned with the y-axis, meaning its sides are parallel to the y-axis. When we traverse along the y-axis, a difference of 5 is calculated. Therefore, we subtract 5 from (5; 0), which results in (5 - 5; 0), and this becomes (0; 0). All the previous steps were followed when (0; 0) was pursued. So, when looking at the problem, since the previous steps matched the one followed in this response, one can deduce that (0; 0) would be logically the correct answer. Final Answer: The final answer is (0; 0). I hope it is correct.
