Raisonnement: The question asks us to determine the volume of a cylindrical tube as a function of its radius and length. Here is an explanation of the appropriate response: We can refer to the following diagram for analysis: "*   "**Le** **rectangle** **rectangulaire**" can be terminated as the volume of a rectangle's rectangle. The area of a rectangle with length $l$ and width $b$ is $lb$, and the volume of a box (or cubic block or unit cube) with side length $a$ is $(a^3)$ (because we have $a \times a \times a$). Therefore, if the volume of a box is three times that of a rectangle, we have: $L = 3B$ Note that $L$ stands for the strict limited volume, or "volume limitée" as mentioned in the image. Now we can try solving for L in terms of B. We begin by rewriting the above equation into the following form: $L = 3(2B)$ This was yielded by multiplying both sides of the previous equation by two. Next, we can substitute in $(A \times B \times C)^2$, where A = C. Plugging the above equation into the left-hand side of the markdown markdown_handcode code makes it clear to derive the final solution using basic statistics. The volume formula for a cylindrical tube with radius B and height/L was first taught to the author in $7th$ grade. Thus, we can say B = A and use the substituted $L $ to simplify the equation to find our solution. B = $\pi \times B^2 \div \pi = 3B \div \pi \times (\pi \times L ) =  \pi \times B \times  3 \times .getLast  = \pi^2 B \times LR \quad R nl > 1 $ since $B \times LR$ represents our resized answer. The penultimate numerical value, which is 3 radians divided by $\pi$, will mean our conventional answer amounts to Pi X as per m.
