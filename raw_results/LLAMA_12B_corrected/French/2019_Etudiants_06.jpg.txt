Raisonnement :
To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer whose digits sum up to 2019.

* We can start by assuming that the number has only 2019 digits, which is highly unlikely.
* A more reasonable approach is to break down 2019 into smaller parts and try to find the smallest possible combination of digits that add up to this number.
* One possible way to do this is by using the magic sum method, where we try to find a combination of digits that sum up to a certain value (in this case, 2019).
* After trying different combinations, we find that the smallest possible number is 3,999,999,999 (a 10-digit number).
