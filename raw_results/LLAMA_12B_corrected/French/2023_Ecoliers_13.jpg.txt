Raisonnement: The question 13 is asking about the color of Bamby and her seven disguises, with one of the disguises being different from the others. The question states that if one of the disguises were different, the uses would be combined in the same way as if Bamby were in position 1. This implies that if one of the disguises were different, the uses would be combined in the same way as if Bamby were in position 1. However, since there is no mention of a different disguise in the question, the correct answer is that there is no different disguise.
