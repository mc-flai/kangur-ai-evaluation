Raisonnement: The image shows a geometric figure with points P, R, Q, and S. The figure appears to be a straight line with two similar triangles drawn on it. The lines connecting the points are labeled as follows:

* PR = QS
* PQ = PR

To determine the measure of the angle RQS, we need to use the properties of similar triangles. Similar triangles have proportional sides and congruent angles.

Let's analyze the given information:

* PR = QS (corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional)
* PQ = PR (corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional)

Since the corresponding sides are proportional, the corresponding angles are also congruent. Therefore, we can conclude that angle RQS is congruent to angle PRQ.

We are given that angle PRQ measures 20°. Since angle RQS is congruent to angle PRQ, we can conclude that angle RQS also measures 20°.

Now, let's examine the remaining options:

A) 45°
B) 50°
C) 60°
D) 65°
E) 70°

Based on our analysis, the correct answer is:

Réponse: A) 45°
