Raisonnement: The question is asking to identify the shape that results from cutting along the dotted line on a circular placard twice and offsetting the resulting right-angled triangle. The ray and angle bisector theorems can be utilized to analyze this situation. When the placard is bisected every 120 degrees, there will be three 120-degree angles that intersect and form a triangle with two right angles at each corner. Therefore, the shape that results from this transformation is star-shaped, with the two inside angles of each feather being identical. Moreover, because the triangular shape cuts off two 120-degree angles, the angle outside each feather is 60 degrees. With these conclusions, it can be seen that in the case of the option c) star-shaped placard, the TWO feeding of the flower, which is shown in figure 5, represents the feather at the start, and their inside angles of 120 degrees and their outside angle of 60 degrees.
