Raisonnement: To solve this question, we need to understand the given equation and find the value of k.

Given equation : $8^k = 2^{3k}$

To solve for k, we can use the fact that $8 = 2^3$. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

$(2^3)^k = 2^{3k}$

Using the property of exponents, we can simplify this to:

$2^{3k} = 2^{3k}$

Since the bases are equal, we can equate the exponents:

$3k = 3k$

This equation is true for any value of k, so there are infinitely many solutions.

However, we are given options A) 2, B) 4, C) 6, D) 8, and E) 12. To find the correct answer, we need to find a value of k that satisfies the equation.

We can substitute each option into the equation and check if it is true:

A) 2: $8^2 = 64 = 2^6 \neq 2^{3 \cdot 2} = 2^6$

B) 4: $8^4 = 4096 = 2^{12} \neq 2^{3 \cdot 4} = 2^{12}$

C) 6: $8^6 = 262144 = 2^{18} = 2^{3 \cdot 6}$

D) 8: $8^8 = 16777216 = 2^{24} \neq 2^{3 \cdot 8} = 2^{24}$

E) 12: $8^{12} = 134217728 = 2^{36} \neq 2^{3 \cdot 12} = 2^{36}$
