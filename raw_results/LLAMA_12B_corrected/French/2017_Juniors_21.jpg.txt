Raisonnement: To solve this question, we need to find the smallest common multiple (LCM) of 21 and 882 that is greater than or equal to 18. 1. **Find the prime factors of both numbers:**   - 21 = 3 * 7   - 882 = 2 * 3^2 * 7^2 2. **Identify the highest power of each prime factor:**   - Highest power of 2: 2^0 (since 21 does not have 2 as a factor)   - Highest power of 3: 3^2 (from 882)   - Highest power of 7: 7^2 (from 882) 3. **Calculate the LCM:**   - LCM = 2^0 * 3^2 * 7^2 = 1 * 9 * 49 = 441 However, this LCM is less than 882. Therefore, we need to find another solution. 4. **Check if the question allows a two-digit or a three-digit answer:**   - Since the question does not explicitly state any constraints on the length of the answer, we can proceed with our calculations. 5. **Check for additional factors in 882 that were not considered in step 3:**   - It seems we missed considering the factor 2 explicitly in step 3, which was included in step 4 incorrectly as it already accounts for the factor in the form of 2^0. 6. **Recalculate the LCM including all factors including the missing one:**   - Corrected LCM = 2^0 * 3^2 * 7^2 = 1 * 9 * 49 = 441 Considering the initial answer doesn't match the provided choices, let's reevaluate the information: - **Reflect on referencing the correct set of available options A) 23, B) 25, C) 27, D) 31, E) 33:**   - These options suggest we might have overlooked aligning our solution with the choices offered. Upon re-evaluation of our solution steps, it appears there was no clear path to align with the given answer choices provided directly.
