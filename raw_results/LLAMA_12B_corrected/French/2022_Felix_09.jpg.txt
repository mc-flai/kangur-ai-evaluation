Raisonnement: The koala is trying to visit the koala and can't jump through a square with water. The rules of this game are as follows: 1. Each arrow is an action that the koala can take. 2. If the koala is at an arrow, it leaps in the direction of the arrow on its next turn. 3. The koala cannot jump through a square with water. From these rules, we can see that there are a limited amount of squares that the koala is allowed to visit while following this path. As we analyze the provided options for the path the koala can take, we need to ensure that the path avoids water. * **Option A:** Although the given path includes a square with water, it is the final square, visited before reaching the last koala. Since the final square with water can be bypassed, we must consider it as a viable option. * **Option B:** Out of the provided options, this path is most efficient and does not include squares that the koala cannot jump through. * **Option C:** Similar to option A, there is one square with water in the centre, where the koala should make an action change to avoid the water. * **Option C:** * **Option D:** Option D is similar to option B, and this one even includes a water square, which can be moved to another side of the koala by jumping higher. * **Option E:** There is a single square that is inaccessible to the koala, making option E incorrect. Given the context and the prerequisites for the solution, the correct answer is option B.
