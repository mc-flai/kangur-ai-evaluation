Raisonnement: The question asks to identify the function that, when its graph is reflected with respect to the x-axis, contains the specified points. The solution can be obtained by applying the fundamental transformation property of functions when the graph is reflected around the x-axis: if $f(x)$ represents the function and ${\rm g}(x)=-f(x)$ represents the reflected function with respect to the x-axis, then any point (x, y) on the graph of $f(x)$ corresponds to the point (x, -y) on the reflected graph ${\rm g}(x)$. Therefore, if the point (a, b) is on the graph of $f(x)$, the point (a, -b) should be on the graph of $g(x)$. Here, the label shows the points on the graph of $f(x)$ are (3, 4), (2, 3), and (1, 2), which can be remembered as (x, y) = (x, x). Therefore, $y = x$ can be the possible option. Likewise, the question's label shows the reflected function can have the form $y = f(x) = x$, meaning option $g_{1}(x) = x^{2}$ realizes this using $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ as given in Figure 2.
