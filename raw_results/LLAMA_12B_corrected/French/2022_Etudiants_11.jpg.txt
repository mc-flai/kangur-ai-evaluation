Raisonnement: To solve this question, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Given data: HG = 12 cm, UO = 18 cm. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of HU: HU^2 + UO^2 = HG^2, HU^2 + 18^2 = 12^2, HU^2 + 324 = 144, HU^2 = 144 - 324, HU^2 = -180, HU = √(-180), HU = 6√(-5), HU is not a real number, so the triangle cannot exist. Since HU cannot be a real number, we can conclude that the distance between the midpoint [HU] and the point [GO] is not defined.
