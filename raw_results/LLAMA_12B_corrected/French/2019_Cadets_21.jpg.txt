Raisonnement: The question presented in the image is a logic puzzle where the person is tasked with determining which letter unlocks the large cube situated at the top-right of the image. To solve the problem, the person is informed that each cube enclosure holds one of the letters A, B, C, D, E, or F. Upon a quick examination of the puzzle, the individual has identified that the key to unlocking the puzzle is based on a three-step process.

**Step 1: B B*
   In the first step, it is clear that having two cubes with the letter B next to each other enables the individual to unlock one of the cubes. If there is a B on the next level down and one to the right of the double B, the individual can combine these two Bs to get the correct proceeding, C.

**Step 2: C E*
   In the second step, the puzzle illustrates that once the individual has the correct proceeding code, the combination must be painted on the left-hand side of the cube shown at the top-right of the illustration. If the C is painted to the left, above the enclosed double B, and there is a smaller cube on the left side along with one to the right on the adjacent row down, the individual can proceed.

**Step 3: Success
   With the final solution shown in the last portion of the puzzle, the solution **C E** is displayed. Therefore, one can confidently assert that the answer to question 21 is letter option C). The reasoning provided above is grounded in observing the visual clues of the puzzle and combining known information and deducing the key combinations. &#x20;
