Raisonnement: The shaded area is composed of the small cross in the center and the four small crosses on its sides. Each small cross has an area of 1 cm². There are four small crosses on the sides of the larger cross, so their combined area is 4 cm². The area of the shaded part is the area of the small cross in the center plus the combined area of the four small crosses on its sides. Area of the shaded part = Area of the small cross in the center + Combined area of the four small crosses on its sides = 1 cm² + 4 cm² = 5 cm². Therefore, the correct answer is D) 5,5 cm².

Réponse: D) 5,5 cm².
