Raisonnement: The question asks us to determine the correct arrangement of cubes from five possible options (A to E), given the instructions of "La figure de droite montre un assemblage de neuf cubes collés. Laquelle, parmi les cinq propositions, montre une autre vue du même assemblage?" Step 1: Analyze the options: * Option A: A 3D figure with two connected cubes on the left and a single cube on the right. * Option B: A 3D figure with a structure resembling the letter "T" with three cubes on top and two cubes on the bottom. * Option C: A 3D figure with a single cube in the center and four cubes attached to it, forming a cube with a hole in the middle. * Option D: A 3D figure with two cubes connected by a single cube in the middle, forming an "L" shape. * Option E: A 3D figure with a structure resembling the letter "Y" with three cubes on the right and two cubes on the left. Step 2: Identify the common feature among the options: All options have a similar structure with several cubes attached to each other. This indicates that the correct answer is likely one of these options. However, some options have different numbers of cubes (e.g., A has two cubes, while others have more). This suggests that the correct answer is not simply the one with the most cubes. Step 3: Consider the possibilities: Option A has only two cubes, which might not be enough to form the same arrangement as the original figure. Option B has a more complex structure, but it does not seem to match the original figure. Option C has a hole in the middle, which might be a characteristic of the original figure. Option D has a clear "L" shape, which could match the original figure. Option E has a similar structure to Option E, but with an extra cube on the right, which might not match the original figure. Step 4: Eliminate the impossible options: Option A can be eliminated because it has too few cubes. Option E can be eliminated because it has too many cubes and the wrong orientation. Step 5: Choose the most promising option: Between Options B, C, and D, we need to choose the one that best matches the original figure. Option C has a hole in the middle, which might be a characteristic of the original figure. Option D has an "L" shape, which could match the original.
