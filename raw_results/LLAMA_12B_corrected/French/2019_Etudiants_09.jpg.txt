Raisonnement: The question is asking for the number of faces of a 23-gonal pyramid. To calculate the total number of faces, we will first add the number of triangular and rectangular faces. Then, subtract the number of joint points. Let's denote the number of triangular faces as $tet$ and the number of rectangular faces as $rect$. We can represent a 23-gonal pyramid as a sequence of blocks with the bottom face being a 23-gon. Starting with three rows, we have 23 $tet$ (cone) in the first row, 22 $tet$ in the second row and 21 $tet$ in the third row. Considering the four right-angled triangles formed in the direction of the apex, we obtain the following equations: $rect = tess(penta) = 5 \times 23 - 23 - 21 = 30$. Additionally, we must subtract the number of joint points: $joint (\text{square}) = 3 \times 23 - 3 - 3 = 21$. The sum of rectangular, triangular, and square faces is: $\boxed{69}$. Final answer: C) 46 ### Raise Yes, the correct answer is 69.
