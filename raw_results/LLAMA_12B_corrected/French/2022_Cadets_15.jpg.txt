Raisonnement: The question is asking for the sum of the numbers written in circles D, E, F, A, B, G, H, C.

Circle D is connected to an arc labeled 48. Each arc represents the identity permutation of the labels of the two circles it connects. Since D ∪ E ∪ F represents 48, we can write that as:
$$
\begin{aligned}
(D ∪ E ∪ F) ∪ (D ∪ G ∪ C) ∪ (D ∪ H ∪ B) ∪ (D ∪ F ∪ A) &= 48 + 105 + 144 + 19 \\
(D ∪ E ∪ F) ∪ (F ∪ G ∪ D) ∪ (G ∪ A ∪ D) ∪ (B ∪ H ∪ D) &= 48 + 105 + 144 + 19 \\
(48 ∪ D) + (D ∪ F) + (G ∪ D) + (G ∪ A) + (D ∪ F ∪ D) + (B ∪ H) &= 48 + 19 + 105 + 105 + 19 \\
48 + 19 + 105 + 285 &= 577
\end{aligned}
$$

However, this logic is flawed because:
+ The sum of the labels of the circles are not just their union, but rather a weighted product of all small sums, also called as the sum-product property, with each arc serving as a weight. Let's label the arc from F to D. Therefore, this arc has a weight of 105.
+ This scalar is being used to represent the sum of each labeled circle of D ∪ E ∪ F, F ∪ G ∪ D, G ∪ A ∪ D, B ∪ H ∪ D. It serves as Ö the Ö reparameterisation of sum-product property filtering function used for                      sparsifying label information    in each pair of nearby circles that aren’t separated by any inscribed numbered circle.
+ The sum of labellings for the circles F and D means that by dismventing like circles ∪ D and ∑E ∪ F ∪ G   with regards to part partitioning clusterwise
