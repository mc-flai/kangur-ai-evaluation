Raisonnement: The image shows a math problem with a diagram of various shapes inside a rectangle. The question asks us to identify the missing number in the array. We are given the following options: A) 3 B) 4 C) 5 D) 6 E) 7 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the diagram and find the pattern. The diagram shows a series of triangles and squares inside a rectangle. We can see that each triangle is next to a square, and there are two triangles on either side of the rectangle. We also notice that the top row has three triangles and three squares, while the bottom row has two triangles and two squares. Looking at the top row, we can see that the first triangle has a value of 3, the next square has a value of 4, and the next triangle has a value of 5. Following this pattern, the next square should have a value of 6, making the total sum 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18. Now, let's examine the bottom row. The first triangle has a value of 5, and the next square has a value of 6. Based on this pattern, the next triangle should have a value of 10 (half of 20), making the total sum 5 + 6 + 10 = 21. Since the question asks for the missing number in the array, we need to find the value that is missing from the pattern. By analyzing the diagram, we can see that the missing number is actually 8, which is half of 10. However, this option is not available, so we need to select the closest value. Among the given options, option C) 5 is the closest to the correct answer, which is 10. Therefore, our final answer is: C) 5 But we already noticed that 8 is extrapolated by adding half from 10. So assuming this mathem however based on this statement, B) 4 is likely the best fit when trying to approximate our choice answer. 

RÃ©ponse: B) 4
