Raonament: This is a combinatorics problem. The person can climb the stairs in steps of 1 or 2. The sum of these steps must equal 8. Let's denote the number of steps of size 1 as 'a' and the number of steps of size 2 as 'b'. We have the equation: a + 2b = 8. We can find the values of a and b:

*   b = 0, a = 8
*   b = 1, a = 6
*   b = 2, a = 4
*   b = 3, a = 2
*   b = 4, a = 0

For each combination of a and b we need to find the number of ways to arrange those steps. We can use the formula for permutations with repetition: n! / (p! * q!), where n is the total number of steps (a + b), p is the number of steps of type 1 (a) and q is the number of steps of type 2 (b).

*   b=0, a=8: 8!/(8!*0!) = 1 way
*   b=1, a=6: 7!/(6!*1!) = 7 ways
*   b=2, a=4: 6!/(4!*2!) = 15 ways
*   b=3, a=2: 5!/(2!*3!) = 10 ways
*   b=4, a=0: 4!/(0!*4!) = 1 way

Summing these up we get: 1 + 7 + 15 + 10 + 1 = 34
