Raonament: The length of the rope consists of two parts: straight segments and circular arcs.  The straight segments form an equilateral triangle with side length equal to 4 diameters (4 * 2 = 8 cm) plus 2 segments each one equal to the diameter (2 cm each). Thus, the sum of the three straight segments is 4 * 2 + 2 * 2= 12 cm.  The circular arcs form three 120-degree arcs, one around each circle.  The total length of these arcs is equivalent to the circumference of one circle, which is π * d = 2π cm.  Therefore, the total length of the rope is 12 + 2π cm.
