Raonament: The question indicates that assembling the puzzle creates a rectangle and an arithmetic operation is performed. The numbers are 2, 0, 2, 4 and x. Since the result options are numerical, we can interpret that the x in the puzzle represents an operation. Therefore, the puzzle suggests concatenation of the numbers. The sequence 2024 could involve arithmetic or concatenation. The possible answers are the concatenated numbers. Thus, the solution is found by considering the concatenation of numbers. In the picture, the puzzle pieces read 2, 0, 2, 4.  The "x" likely represents the "times" symbol to result in a number. So, the operation would likely be 202 x 4, which gives 808.

Resposta: B)
