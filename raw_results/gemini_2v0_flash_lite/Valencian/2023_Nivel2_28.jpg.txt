1. **Area of the square:** The square ABCE has a side of 4 cm, so its area is 4 cm * 4 cm = 16 cm².
2. **Area of the triangle:** The triangle ECD has the same area as the square, so its area is also 16 cm².
3. **Base of the triangle:** The base of the triangle ECD is CE, which is a side of the square and thus has a length of 4 cm.
4. **Height of the triangle:** We can calculate the height of the triangle using the area formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height.  So, 16 cm² = (1/2) * 4 cm * height. Solving for the height, we get height = 8 cm.  This height is the perpendicular distance from point D to the line containing the base CE.
5. **Distance from D to line g:** The line g passes through points B and A, so the distance from D to g is the sum of the side of the square (BC = 4 cm) and the height of the triangle ECD (8 cm). Therefore, the distance from D to the line g is 4 cm + 8 cm = 12 cm.
