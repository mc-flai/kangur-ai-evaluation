Raonament: The problem requires us to complete a 4x4 square where the sum of numbers in each row and column is the same. The pieces provided can be combined with one of the answer options to get the answer. Let's determine the sum we need. The provided pieces have the following sums: 2+2+1+2=7, 2+1+3+1=7, 2+3+1+2=8.  We need a sum of 8 in each row and column.
Let's evaluate each option:
A) 1+1+3 = 5. The total sum would be 7 + 7 + 8 + 5 = 27, divided by 4 rows, each row must be the same, therefore 27/4 which is not a valid integer.
B) 2+1+0 = 3. Sum 7+7+8+3=25.
C) 1+2+1 = 4. Sum 7+7+8+4=26.
D) 2+2+2 = 6. Sum 7+7+8+6=28. 28/4 = 7. If the pieces are placed in the correct position, this seems to work.
E) 2+2+3=7. Sum 7+7+8+7=29.
Analyzing D: we can arrange the blocks so that the sum of each row and each column will be 7.

Resposta: D)
