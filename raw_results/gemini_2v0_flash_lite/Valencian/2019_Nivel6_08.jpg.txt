Raonament:
The problem gives probabilities for rolling a 1 (1/2), a 2 (1/3) and a 3 (1/6). We want to find the view of a dice that *cannot* be possible given these probabilities.

The sum of the probabilities is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1. This is a good start. Since we are using a standard six-sided die, this means there must be a total number of faces that correspond to each of the probabilities. The key idea is to realize that a 1 appears on half the faces.  A 2 appears on 1/3 of the faces and a 3 appears on 1/6 of the faces.

Let's analyze the views:
*   **A:** shows a 1, 2, and 4. It's possible to show a 1. Also can be shown 2.
*   **B:** shows a 2 and 3. Not possible to show a 3.
*   **C:** shows a 2 and 3. Not possible to show a 3.
*   **D:** shows a 2, 3, and 5.
*   **E:** shows a 2 and 3.

To get the probability of 1/2 for a 1, the die must have 3 sides with a 1 (6 sides x 1/2 = 3 sides).
To get the probability of 1/3 for a 2, the die must have 2 sides with a 2 (6 sides x 1/3 = 2 sides).
To get the probability of 1/6 for a 3, the die must have 1 side with a 3 (6 sides x 1/6 = 1 side).

Consider each of the possible dice views, based on the assumption that this is a standard die, where the faces only contain the numbers 1, 2, and 3:
A shows 1,2, and 4. No. The die doesn't have 4s.
B shows 2 and 3. Is possible.
C shows 2 and 3. Is possible.
D shows 3, 2, and 5. No. The die doesn't have 5s.
E shows 2 and 3. Is possible.
Given the probabilities, the possible faces of the die can have, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, and 3. So the images that can be viewed must have only 1, 2, and 3 on its face.

Let's see some of the combinations:
A is impossible because it displays a 4.
B and C: are possible
D is impossible because it shows a 5.
E is possible.

So the ones that can't be a possible view of the die are A and D.
