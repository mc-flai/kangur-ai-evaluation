Raonament: Let's denote the time the ciclomotor takes to arrive as *t* hours. The bicycle takes *t* + 1 hours. The distance is the same for both vehicles.
Distance = Velocity * Time.
For the ciclomotor: Distance = 30 * t
For the bicycle: Distance = 20 * (t + 1)

Since the distances are the same: 30t = 20(t + 1)
30t = 20t + 20
10t = 20
t = 2 hours

The distance is then 30 * 2 = 60 km
