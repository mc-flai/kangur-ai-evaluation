Raonament:
1.  **Anna:** Dice that A wins and B is second.
2.  **Maria:** Says C is second and D is fourth.
3.  **Rosa:** Says A is second and D is third.
4.  Since each person has one correct and one incorrect prediction, we need to check the options.
5.  **Option A) ABCD:**
    *   Anna: A wins (Correct), B second (Correct). Incorrect.
    *   Maria: C second (Incorrect), D fourth (Correct). Correct.
    *   Rosa: A second (Incorrect), D third (Incorrect). Incorrect.
    *   Anna's statement is wrong.
6.  **Option B) ABDC:**
    *   Anna: A wins (Correct), B second (Incorrect). Incorrect.
    *   Maria: C second (Incorrect), D fourth (Correct). Correct.
    *   Rosa: A second (Incorrect), D third (Incorrect). Incorrect.
    *   Anna's statement is wrong.
7.  **Option C) ACDB:**
    *   Anna: A wins (Correct), B second (Incorrect). Incorrect.
    *   Maria: C second (Correct), D fourth (Incorrect). Correct.
    *   Rosa: A second (Incorrect), D third (Correct). Incorrect.
    *   Anna's statement is wrong.
8.  **Option D) BADC:**
    *   Anna: A wins (Incorrect), B second (Correct). Correct.
    *   Maria: C second (Incorrect), D fourth (Incorrect). Incorrect.
    *   Rosa: A second (Incorrect), D third (Incorrect). Incorrect.
    *   Anna's statement is wrong.
9.  **Option E) DCBA:**
    *   Anna: A wins (Incorrect), B second (Incorrect). Incorrect.
    *   Maria: C second (Incorrect), D fourth (Correct). Correct.
    *   Rosa: A second (Incorrect), D third (Incorrect). Incorrect.

Let's examine the predictions:
If D is fourth, then A could be second, so then A is second (Rosa is correct). Then C can not be second and B can not be second. Then A must be first, and B can not be second (Anna incorrect).

In ACDB:
*   Anna is incorrect.
*   Maria is correct.
*   Rosa is correct.
*   The order cannot have all correct or incorrect predictions.
The correct answer must have one correct and one wrong for all persons.

Consider BADC:
*   Anna is one correct (B=2nd) and one incorrect (A=1st).
*   Maria is correct.
*   Rosa: Incorrect.

In ABCD:
*   Anna: Correct
*   Maria: Incorrect
*   Rosa is incorrect.

Check again
If A is first and B is second Anna is correct, but Maria and Rosa are incorrect.

BADC
Anna: B is second. Correct. A is first. Incorrect.
Maria: C is second. Incorrect. D is fourth. Incorrect
Rosa: A is second. Incorrect. D is third. Incorrect.
The correct answer is ABDC:

A wins, so Anna is correct. But B isn't second. Maria is correct.
C is second, so D is fourth. Rosa: A can't be second. D is third.

A, B, C, D
A says A wins and B is second. (A correct, if A is 1st and B is second)
Maria says C is second and D is fourth.
Rosa says A is second and D is third.

Try ABDC:
Anna: A wins. Correct, B is second. Incorrect. (1 correct)
Maria: C is second. Incorrect, D is fourth. Correct (1 correct)
Rosa: A is second. Incorrect, D is third. Incorrect (0 correct)
So no.

Let's try C, so we need to get Rosa right.
So D must be in 3rd position.

A wins (Anna) but B isn't second.
C is second, D is fourth, (Maria)
A is second, D is third. (Rosa)

If A is 1st and B can't be 2nd,
If C can't be 2nd, then D must be 3rd.
Option C): ACDB.
Anna: A 1st - Correct, B 2nd - Incorrect.
Maria: C 2nd - Correct, D 4th - Incorrect.
Rosa: A 2nd - Incorrect, D 3rd - Correct.

This does not work as this has 2 correct in Rosa.

Answer: B)
If the option is ABDC, we have
Anna: A 1st - Correct. B 2nd-Incorrect.
Maria: C is 2nd - Incorrect, D 4th - Correct.
Rosa: A is 2nd - Incorrect. D 3rd. Incorrect.
So, ABDC.

Resposta: B)
