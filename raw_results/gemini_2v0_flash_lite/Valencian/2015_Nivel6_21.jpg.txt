Raonament:
The question asks for the age of the professor. The answer is determined by the number of positive integers less than 101 that are divisible by the square of a natural number greater than 1.
Let's list the squares of natural numbers greater than 1: 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100.
Now, let's determine how many multiples of these squares are less than 101:
- Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, ..., 100 (25 multiples)
- Multiples of 9: 9, 18, 27, ..., 99 (11 multiples)
- Multiples of 16: 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96 (6 multiples)
- Multiples of 25: 25, 50, 75, 100 (4 multiples)
- Multiples of 36: 36, 72 (2 multiples)
- Multiples of 49: 49, 98 (2 multiples)
- Multiples of 64: 64 (1 multiple)
- Multiples of 81: 81 (1 multiple)
- Multiples of 100: 100 (1 multiple)
However, some of these multiples are shared, like multiples of 4 are also multiples of 16 or 36, for example, 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96 from the previous examples are divisible by 4.
We are looking for the number of integers that are divisible by the *square* of a natural number greater than 1. We can count them.
Numbers divisible by 4 (excluding those already counted as divisible by 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100).
List all the numbers divisible by the squares greater than 1 and less than 101.
4, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 25, 27, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 45, 48, 49, 50, 52, 54, 56, 60, 63, 64, 68, 72, 75, 76, 80, 81, 84, 88, 90, 92, 96, 98, 99, 100.
There are 25 multiples of 4 <=100. Multiples of 9, 11 total. Multiples of 16, 6 total. Multiples of 25, 4 total. Multiples of 36, 2. Multiples of 49, 2. Multiples of 64, 1. Multiples of 81, 1. Multiples of 100, 1.
We are looking for distinct values.
Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, 44, 52, 60, 68, 76, 84, 92
Multiples of 9: 9, 18, 27, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99
Multiples of 16: 16, 32, 48, 80, 96
Multiples of 25: 25, 50, 75
Multiples of 36: 36, 72
Multiples of 49: 49, 98
Multiples of 64: 64
Multiples of 81: 81
Multiples of 100: 100

Counting each number: 4,8,9,12,16,18,20,24,25,27,28,32,36,40,44,45,48,49,50,52,54,56,60,63,64,68,72,75,76,80,81,84,88,90,92,96,98,99,100. There are 39 total numbers
The answer is 39.
