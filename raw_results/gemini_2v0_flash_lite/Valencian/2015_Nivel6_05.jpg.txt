Raonament:
*   **A) sin α:** For α = 1°, sin α is a value between 0 and 1.
*   **B) cos α:** For α = 1°, cos α is a value between 0 and 1.
*   **C) tan α:** For α = 1°, tan α is approximately 0.017, which is less than 1.
*   **D) cot α:** cot α = 1/tan α. Since tan(1°) is a small positive number, cot(1°) will be a large positive number, therefore greater than 1.
*   **E) sin² α + cos² α:** This is a fundamental trigonometric identity, and sin² α + cos² α = 1 for any angle α.

Resposta: D)
