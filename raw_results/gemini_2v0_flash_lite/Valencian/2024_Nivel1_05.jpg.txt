Raonament: The star is made up of four equilateral triangles and a square. The perimeter of the square is 36 cm, so each side of the square is 36 cm / 4 = 9 cm. Each side of the equilateral triangles is the same length as the side of the square, which is 9 cm.  The perimeter of the star consists of 8 sides, which are the sides of the triangles. Since there are four triangles, and each triangle has two sides that form part of the perimeter of the star, the perimeter of the star is 8 * 9 cm = 72 cm.
