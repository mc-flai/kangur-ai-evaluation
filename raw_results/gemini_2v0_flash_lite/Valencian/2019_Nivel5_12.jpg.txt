Raonament: To minimize the sum a/b + c/d, we want to make the fractions as small as possible. This means we want small numerators (a and c) and large denominators (b and d). Also, the numbers a, b, c and d are different.

Let's try some combinations using the smallest available numerators (1 and 2). We can set a = 1 and c = 2.  Then the denominators must be the largest numbers available, 9 and 10, but this is not as we want.  So, let's try to have one fraction small and one fraction somewhat small.

The smallest fractions we can make are likely with the numbers 1 and 2 as numerators, and choosing the largest possible numbers for the denominators from the set {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. If a = 1, c = 2, let's take b = 9, d = 10. So we have 1/9 + 2/10 = 1/9 + 1/5 = (5 + 9)/45 = 14/45. Let's also try a=1, c=2 and swap the denominators, so 1/10 + 2/9 = (9+20)/90 = 29/90. Let's try different numerators; let a = 1, c=3. Then choose b = 8 and d = 10, then 1/8 + 3/10 = (5+12)/40= 17/40.
Let's evaluate each option:
A) 2/10 = 1/5
B) 3/19 (very small)
C) 14/45 ~ 0.31
D) 29/90 ~ 0.32
E) 25/72 = 25/72 ~ 0.34

Another potential arrangement: a = 1, b = 9, c = 2, d = 10 -> 1/9 + 2/10 = 1/9 + 1/5 = 14/45.
a = 1, b = 10, c = 2, d = 9 -> 1/10 + 2/9 = 29/90
So, we want to try to have the largest possible values for the denominators.
Try other combinations to see if we can go lower than 14/45. a=1, b=8, c=2, d=9.  Then 1/8 + 2/9 = (9+16)/72 = 25/72. Try a=1, b=8, c=3, d=10. 1/8 + 3/10 = (5 + 12)/40 = 17/40.
Finally try to have something smaller: a=1, c=2, b=9, d=10, gives 1/9 + 2/10 = 14/45.
Check other combinations. The minimum should be 29/90.
