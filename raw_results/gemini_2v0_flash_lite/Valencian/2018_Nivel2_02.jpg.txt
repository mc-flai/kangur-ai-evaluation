Raonament: The question states that we start counting at 19 and count up to 89. We also know that counting takes one second for each number. The goal is to calculate the total time it takes to complete this.
First, we need to find the total number of integers in this range (inclusive). The formula to do this is: (last number - first number) + 1
In our case that is: (89-19) + 1 = 70 + 1 = 71.
Since we take 1 second per number, we have 71 seconds total.
71 seconds equals to 1 minute and 11 seconds.
