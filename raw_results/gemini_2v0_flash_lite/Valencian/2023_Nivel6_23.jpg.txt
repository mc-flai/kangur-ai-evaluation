Raonament: The first equation, |x| + |y| = 1, represents a square rotated by 45 degrees, centered at the origin. The second equation, x² - y² = 1, represents a hyperbola. To find the number of solutions, we need to find the number of intersections between these two curves. The hyperbola opens along the x-axis. The "square" from |x| + |y| = 1 intersects the hyperbola at (1,0) and (-1,0).  There are only two points of intersection.

Resposta: B)
