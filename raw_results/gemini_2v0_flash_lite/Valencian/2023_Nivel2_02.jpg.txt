Raonament:
Examining the image, we can identify the following quadrilaterals:
*   Rectangle (the main body of the house)
*   Trapezoid (the roof)
*   Square (the vertical division of the body of the house)

A parallelogram could also be present, depending on the angles of the roof. But a perfect square is also in this image. The question asks what shape can't be found.

Resposta: B)
