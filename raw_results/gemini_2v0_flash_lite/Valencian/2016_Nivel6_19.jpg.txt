We need to find integer pairs (x, y) such that x > 2, y > 2, and 1/x + 1/y > 1/2.
Let's analyze some cases, since there is no quick way to solve it.

If x = 3: 1/3 + 1/y > 1/2 => 1/y > 1/2 - 1/3 = 1/6 => y < 6. Since y > 2, then y can be 3, 4, or 5. This gives us the pairs (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5).
If x = 4: 1/4 + 1/y > 1/2 => 1/y > 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4 => y < 4. Since y > 2, then y can only be 3. This gives us the pair (4, 3).
If x = 5: 1/5 + 1/y > 1/2 => 1/y > 1/2 - 1/5 = 3/10 => y < 10/3 = 3.33... . Since y > 2, y can only be 3. This gives us the pair (5, 3).
If x >= 6, then 1/x <= 1/6. Also, if y > 2, then the maximum of 1/y is when y=3.
Thus, 1/x + 1/y <= 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/2.
So, if x >= 6, no solutions are possible.

Therefore, the pairs are: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (5, 3).
There are 5 pairs.
