Raonament:
The circumference of the cylinder seems to be such that the numbers increase consecutively.
The lowest row goes from 1 to 10, and the second row goes from 23 to 31.
From 1 to 10 there is a total of 10 numbers.
From 23 to 31, there are 9 numbers.
The difference between the starting points of the two rows is 22.
The question mark represents the third row. Following the same logic, we can predict the beginning number by the number of numbers added from the previous row.
If we do 22 + 9 = 31, then we add 31 to the final number.
Therefore the next number must start at 31 + 22 = 53.
Since from the first row to the second we lost 1 number, and from the second to the third we will lose another, the numbers will be 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, and 60, which are 8 numbers.
Therefore the answer is 60.
