Raonament: Rearranging the equation, we get `xy + 4x - x^2 = 13`, or `x(y + 4 - x) = 13`. Since x and y are integers, then `y + 4 - x` must also be an integer. The factors of 13 are 1, 13, -1, and -13. We set up the following cases.
Case 1: x = 1 and y + 4 - x = 13. Then y + 4 - 1 = 13, so y = 10.  (1, 10) is a solution.
Case 2: x = 13 and y + 4 - x = 1. Then y + 4 - 13 = 1, so y = 10. (13, 10) is a solution.
Case 3: x = -1 and y + 4 - x = -13. Then y + 4 - (-1) = -13, so y = -18. (-1, -18) is a solution.
Case 4: x = -13 and y + 4 - x = -1. Then y + 4 - (-13) = -1, so y = -18. (-13, -18) is a solution.
Thus, there are four solutions.
