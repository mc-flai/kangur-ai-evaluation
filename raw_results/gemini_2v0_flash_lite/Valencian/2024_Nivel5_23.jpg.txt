Let S(N) be the sum of the digits of N. We are given that S(N) = 3 * S(N+1). Since we want to find the smallest possible sum of digits of N, we can start by considering the options.
If S(N) = 3, then S(N+1) = 1. If N has a sum of digits equal to 3, then N can be 3, 12, 21, 30, 102, etc.  If N = 3, N+1 = 4, so S(N+1) = 4, which is not equal to 1. If N=12, then N+1 = 13, and S(N+1) = 1+3=4 which is not equal to 1.
Consider numbers ending in 9s. Let N = 199.  Then S(N) = 1+9+9=19.  N+1=200 and S(N+1)=2.  19 != 3*2
Let's try numbers like N = ...99.  When we add 1, we get a number like N+1 = (...+1)00. So, the last digits are converted to 0, and we increment the previous digit.  When we add 1, it affects the sum of the digits more significantly when the number ends in consecutive nines. S(N+1) = S(N) - 9k +1, where k is number of nines. S(N) = 3 * S(N+1).  Thus, S(N) should be divisible by 3.
Consider the case when N ends in k nines. Then, N+1 will replace the k nines with zeroes, and the digit to the left (if any) will increment by one.
Let's consider the numbers N = a999, so N+1 = (a+1)000
Let's try N = 899. S(N) = 8+9+9 = 26. S(N+1) = 9. 26 != 3*9
Try N = 599. S(N) = 5+9+9 = 23. S(N+1) = 6. 23 != 3*6
Try N = 299. S(N) = 2+9+9 = 20. S(N+1) = 3. 20 != 3*3
Consider N = 69. S(N) = 15. N+1 = 70. S(N+1) = 7. 15 = 3*7 is not true
Try N=89. S(N)=17, N+1=90. S(N+1)=9.
Try N=9. Then S(N) = 9. N+1 = 10, S(N+1) = 1. 9 != 3 *1
Let S(N) = 27. Then S(N+1) = 9. Consider N = 999. S(N) = 27. N+1 = 1000. S(N+1) = 1. Not a solution. Consider N = 899+1 = 900 S(N)=18
Try N = 99. S(N) = 18, and N+1 = 100, so S(N+1) = 1. Not possible.  Try the smallest, with one 9.
Let N be of the form a9.  Let S(N)=12. Then S(N+1) = 4. Possible solutions:
If S(N)=12, we have a9. Then a+9=12. Then a=3. N=39. N+1 = 40. S(N+1) = 4. So S(N) = 12.
If we want the sum to be 12, the minimum is 39.
Consider N=39, S(N)=12, N+1 = 40, S(N+1)=4, 12=3*4.
If N=9. Then S(N)=9. N+1=10, S(N+1)=1. 9 = 3 * 1 is not true.
Try N=1999. S(N) = 28, N+1 = 2000. S(N+1) = 2. 28 != 3*2
If N=19. S(N)=10. N+1=20, S(N+1)=2.
If N=39, S(39) = 12.  N+1=40. S(40)=4. 12 = 3 * 4. Correct.
