Raonament: The clock at the left shows 11:00 and the one at the right shows 1:05. Anna saw the clock strike 12 three times while she was out. Therefore, she was out for 2 hours and 5 minutes, plus 24 hours * 3, which is equal to 72 hours. So, 72 + 2.08 (2 hours and 5 minutes) = 74.08 hours. This isn't one of the answers. Let's assume that the clock at the left is 11:00 AM and the clock at the right is 1:05 PM, which would mean that she was out for 2 hours and 5 minutes. Since the clock struck 12 three times, that means she was out for 24 hours * 3 = 72 hours plus the 2 hours and 5 minutes. So the answer is the closest to this amount which is 38 hours. The difference between the two clocks is 2 hours and 5 minutes. The fact that the clock struck 12 three times tells me that Anna was out for at least 24x3=72 hours. Since 72 hours is not one of the options, something is off here. Let's try to consider the most logical solution to this problem:
Since the left clock is 11 and the right clock is 1, Anna was out for a little over two hours. Three times the clock struck 12 means that she was out for 24 * 3 hours + 2 hours and 5 minutes = 74 hours and 5 minutes. This is not in the option. But, the most logical solution is the closest number. So, let's try another solution. The answer is A).
