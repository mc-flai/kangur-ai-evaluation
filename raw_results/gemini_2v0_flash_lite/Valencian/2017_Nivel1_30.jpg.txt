Raonament: The problem states that the sum of opposite faces of a die is 7. This means that if we see a "1", the opposite face has a "6". We are told that three identical dice are glued together face to face to form a column. We need to determine what we can see on the front face.

Looking at the options, the sum of the dots on each die is 1+3+5 = 9.

A) 1+3+4 = 8
B) 1+3+6 = 10
C) 1+3+5 = 9
D) 1+3+4 = 8
E) 6+3+4 = 13

Since all dice are the same, the faces are consistent, meaning the sums of the visible faces must match. Also, the total sum of visible sides can be 3-21

Looking at the given problem, the arrangement follows a single face is 1, one is 3, and the other is 5.
The sum of the faces showing: 1+3+5=9. The face on the opposite side is 6, 4 and 2. The sum would be 6+4+2=12.

Answer: A) is a possible arrangement. The other ones are not possible.

Resposta: A)
