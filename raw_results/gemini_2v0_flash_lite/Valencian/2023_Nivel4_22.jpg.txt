Raonament: The difference between the gray area and the black area is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares. Therefore, we need to calculate the sum of the squares of the side lengths: 11^2 + 9^2 + 7^2 + 5^2 = 121 + 81 + 49 + 25 = 276. The question asks for the difference between the gray and black areas, which is (11^2 + 7^2) - (9^2 + 5^2) = (121+49) - (81+25) = 170 - 106 = 64.
