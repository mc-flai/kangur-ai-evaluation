Raonament: The question describes a building process where each step covers all the visible faces of the previous step's cubes. The initial structure has one cube, and the next has 6 cubes. The question asks for the next step which will have 3 floors. First, let's determine the number of cubes in the structure with 2 floors in the image. The first structure has 1 cube and the second has 6 cubes, thus, there are 7 total cubes in the structure with 2 floors. The cube with 2 floors needs to be covered, with 7 cubes. When considering a 3 floor structure, the previous structure had 7 cubes so we need to cover all faces of these 7 cubes. In the pictured 2-floor structure, the cubes are arranged to minimize the number of faces visible. The 3-floor structure will have 7 cubes from the previous step, plus additional cubes to cover the visible faces, so each of the 7 cubes would need to be covered. In the previous step 7 cubes were used, and there is one cube with 6 sides (6 faces) and 6 cubes with 5 sides (5 faces). So there are 6 visible faces on the initial structure. In the 2-floor structure there is one cube with 1 face and 6 cubes with 5 faces, therefore, we need to cover 1 + 30 = 31 faces. From the initial structure, we can see that each cube that is added has three faces. The structure of the second cube is built by adding 5 cubes over the first to cover its 6 faces. Therefore, each cube will cover 3 of the visible faces in the structure. The cube with 2 floor has 7 cubes with a total of 31 faces. To cover 31 faces, the minimum number of cubes is approximately 31 / 3 = 10 (rounding up). The cube with 2 floors structure has 7 cubes. With 3 floors it will have an additional 6 to cover all the faces, thus 7 + 6 = 13.
