Raonament: The question asks which glass has a different amount of water. Four glasses should have the same amount of water. Visually, we can eliminate options B, C, D and E because they are tilted, and the water level indicates different volumes. Option A is the only glass that is not tilted and seems to have a different amount of water.
Resposta: A)
