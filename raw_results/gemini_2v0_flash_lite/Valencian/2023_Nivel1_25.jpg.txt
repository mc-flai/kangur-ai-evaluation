Raonament:
1. **Identify shapes and relevant measurements:** The image shows two squares. The first square has a side length of 6 cm, and the second square has a side length of 5 cm. The question asks for the area of the overlapping white region.
2. **Visualize the overlapping area:** The overlapping area forms a right triangle, where one of the right angles is formed with the 6 cm side, and the other right angle is formed with the 5 cm side. We can find the sides of the new right triangle formed from the overlapping area, since a 5 cm side from the second square lies along the 6 cm side of the first square, it leaves the height of the triangle to be 1 cm. With the 5 cm side and the 1 cm side, the triangle has a base of 5 cm and a height of 1 cm.
3. **Calculate the area of the triangle:** The area of the triangle is given by (1/2) * base * height. In this case, (1/2) * 1 * 5 = 2.5 cm².
4. **Calculate the other part of the white area:** The other part of the white area forms a 5cm by 5cm square in the second square. The white area is one-quarter of the first square area.
5. **Find the total white area**: First, we find the area of the total area of the white shape:  The other white part has an area of 5cm * 5cm = 25 cm².  The total white area is 2.5 cm² + (25 cm² / 4) = 2.5 cm² + 6.25 cm² = 8.75 cm². This isn't one of the answers.
6. **Re-evaluate:** I've misinterpreted the image. The white area looks like a smaller square.
7. **Focus on the small square of white:** If the sides of the original square are 6 cm and the other square is 5 cm, then we can see the white area is a square. The sides would then be 1 cm from the original 6 cm side, and the other side would be 5 cm. This doesn't make sense.
8. **Alternative approach:** Look at the triangles.  The top left part is a 1/4 of the total area of the first square. The area of the small square on the top left is 6 * 6 = 36 cm². One triangle would be 36 / 4 = 9 cm².  Then the area of the bottom right is a triangle. The base of this triangle is 5cm and the height is 5cm. The area is 1/2 * 5 * 5 = 12.5 cm².  The remaining shape is 9 - (12.5-area of small white square), which is 9cm². The area of a white part is 1 * 1 = 1 cm. Then the area of a white part is 1 * 5 = 5 cm.
9. **Rethink the intersection:** The intersection forms a smaller square. The sides of this smaller square are 1 cm. The area of the smaller square is 1 * 1 = 1cm. The rest is a triangle and part of a square.  So the side of the white square is 3 cm. The white part is 3 * 3 = 9 cm².
