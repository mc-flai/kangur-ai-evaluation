Raonament: The question asks to increase one of the numbers a, b, c, or d by 1, such that the product of the four numbers (after the increment) is minimized.  Consider that we want the numbers to be as close together as possible to minimize the product.  Since a < b < c < d, increasing either b or c would bring the numbers closer in value, and hence would minimize the product. Therefore the answer is E.

Resposta: E)
