1. **Calculate the initial number of blue fish:** 1.1% of 200 = (1.1/100) * 200 = 2.2 fish. Since we can't have fractions of fish, we'll round it to 2.
2. **Determine the target number of blue fish:** We want the blue fish to represent 2% of the total. Let's assume we remove 'x' fish from the total. The new total number of fish will be (200 - x). We want: (2.2 / (200 - x)) * 100 = 2
3. **Solve for x:**
   2.  2 = 2 * (200 - x) / 100
   3.  2 = (400 - 2x) / 100
   4.  200 = 400 - 2x
   5.  2x = 200
   6.  x = 100
Therefore, we need to remove 100 fish. Let's confirm. If we remove 100 fish the total is 100. The blue fish are 2.2. So 2.2/100 = 2.2%.

Based on initial number calculation, the number should have been rounded to 2
Then :
(2/(200-x)) *100 = 2
200 = 400 - 2x
2x=200
x =100
