Raonament: The problem states that only one pirate answered correctly, and the others lied about all the quantities. Therefore, we need to check the sums for each pirate:
*   **Tom:** 9 (gold) + 11 (silver) + ? (bronze) = 30 -> Bronze = 10. It is valid.
*   **Al:** 7 + 12 + 10 = 29. Does not add up to 30.
*   **Pit:** 10 + 10 + ? = 30 -> Bronze = 10. It is valid.
*   **Jim:** 9 + 10 + ? = 30 -> Bronze = 11. It is valid.

The problem states that only one pirate answered correctly. Since Pit's bronze sum is 10, and the others are different, Tom is the answer because he has 9 gold, 11 silver and 10 bronze (which sums to 30).
