Raonament: This is a classic binary search problem.  With each question, you're effectively halving the possible range of numbers.  Since there are 15 numbers, we need to find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to 15.

*   2^1 = 2 (Not enough)
*   2^2 = 4 (Not enough)
*   2^3 = 8 (Not enough)
*   2^4 = 16 (Enough)

Therefore, 4 questions are needed.
