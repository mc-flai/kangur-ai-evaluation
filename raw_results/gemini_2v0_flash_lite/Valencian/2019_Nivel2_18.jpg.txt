Raonament: The question asks how many of the given figures can be found if we flip the card. The given figure has a grey pattern.  When we flip the card, the grey squares become white and vice versa.  We must identify which of the other figures could be the flipped version of the original.

Let's check the provided figures:
*   Figure 1: This is a match as the flipped version would have the same pattern.
*   Figure 2: This is a match as the flipped version would have the same pattern.
*   Figure 3: This is a match as the flipped version would have the same pattern.
*   Figure 4: This is a match as the flipped version would have the same pattern.
*   Figure 5: This is a match as the flipped version would have the same pattern.

So, all five figures could be the flipped card.
