Raonament:
1. **Calculate the area of the overlapping region:** The overlapping area is one-fourth of the area of each square. So, the overlapping area is 2018 cm² / 4 = 504.5 cm².
2. **Calculate the total area of both squares:** The total area of both squares is 2 * 2018 cm² = 4036 cm².
3. **Calculate the non-overlapping area:** Subtract twice the overlapping area (since it is counted in both squares) from the total area of both squares.  The non-overlapping area is 4036 cm² - 2 * 504.5 cm² = 4036 cm² - 1009 cm² = 3027 cm².
