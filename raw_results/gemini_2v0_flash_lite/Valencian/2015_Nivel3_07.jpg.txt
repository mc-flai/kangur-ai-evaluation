Raonament: The question describes a right isosceles triangle cut into a square and two identical triangles. We must determine which of the given shapes cannot be assembled using these three pieces.
*   **A)** This shape can be made using the square and one of the triangles.
*   **B)** This shape (a trapezoid) can be made using the square and both triangles.
*   **C)** This shape (a rectangle) can be formed using the square and the two triangles as well.
*   **D)** This shape can be constructed from the square and one of the triangles
*   **E)** This shape (a parallelogram) can be constructed from the square and the two triangles.

All the shapes can be formed by the described pieces. Thus, there might be an error in the question. However, between all of the possible options, the parallelogram (E) can't be exactly made.

Resposta: E)
