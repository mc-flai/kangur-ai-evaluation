Raonament: The question asks for the maximum number of internal cubes in a cuboid made up of 2020 smaller cubes. Internal cubes are those with no external faces visible. To maximize the number of internal cubes, we want to create a cuboid as close to a cube as possible. Let's find the closest cube root of 2020. The cube root of 2020 is approximately 12.64. Let us try to find the dimensions of a rectangular cuboid close to that size that will give us 2020 cubes. If we take dimensions of 12x13x13 we have 2028. If we take dimensions 11x14x13 we have 2002. 12x12x14 has 2016 cubes. 10x14x14 has 1960. Since, we want to maximize the internal cubes, and we are restricted to 2020, we want to have the dimensions as close to each other as possible. Consider a rectangular cuboid with dimensions close to the cube root, for example a cuboid with dimensions 12x13x13, this will contain 2028 small cubes. Now, in this case, 2020 = 12x13x13 - 8. The maximum number of internal cubes will be given by multiplying (length-2) * (width-2) * (height-2). If we were using 12x13x13 cuboid, the number of interior cubes will be 10 * 11 * 11 = 1210. If we use the dimensions from 12x12x14, the number of cubes are 2016, so we need to remove 4 cubes. In this case the inner dimensions are 10x10x12 = 1200 cubes. The question states that the cuboid contains 2020 small cubes. The closest three factors will be 10 * 14 * 14, which give us 1960 small cubes, so this cannot be right. Let's consider the 12x13x13 dimensions. However, it consists of 2028 cubes, instead of 2020. So let us consider a cuboid with dimensions 11x14x13, we have 2002 cubes. Then, inner cubes are 9x12x11, giving 1188.  Let's use 2020 and look for three numbers whose product equals it. Now, to find the maximum number of internal cubes, we look for numbers a, b, c such that (a-2) * (b-2) * (c-2) is maximized. If we consider 10 * 11 * 18 = 1980. Consider the 2020 = 4 x 5 x 101. So internal cubes will be 2*3*99 = 594. The internal cubes must be (a-2) * (b-2) * (c-2). With 4 x 5 x 101, then internal cubes are 2*3*99=594
