Raonament:
1. **Lluís > Maria**: Lluís va acabar abans que Maria.
2. **Víctor < Joana**: Víctor va arribar darrere de Joana.
3. **Maria > Joana**: Maria va arribar abans que Joana.
4. **Edu > Víctor**: Edu va acabar abans que Víctor.

Combining the information:
*   From 2 and 4, we get Edu > Víctor > Joana
*   From 1 and 3, we get Lluís > Maria > Joana
*   We know Maria is before Joana, and from 3, Maria is before Joana.

Putting everything together and consolidating, the order is:
Lluís > Maria > Joana
Edu > Víctor > Joana.

Therefore Edu is before Victor, Victor before Joana
Maria before Joana, but Lluis is also before Maria and therefore before Joana.
It can be consolidated in the form of: Lluís > Maria > Joana and Edu > Víctor > Joana. But we do not have information about the position of Lluis and Edu

The information that matters is that both Maria and Victor end before Joana, and Edu ends before Victor. That allows to build a more complete hierarchy:

Lluis > Maria > Joana
Edu > Victor > Joana

So we can establish this:

**Lluís > Maria > Joana**
**Edu > Victor > Joana**

We know that Victor is before Joana, but Edu ends before Victor, and therefore before Joana. Also Maria and Lluis are before Joana. That means Joana is the one at the last position.
