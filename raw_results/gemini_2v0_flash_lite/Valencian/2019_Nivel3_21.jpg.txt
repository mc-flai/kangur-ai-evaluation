Raonament:
Let the initial height of the first candle be $h_1$ and the initial height of the second candle be $h_2$. The first candle burns in 6 hours, so it burns at a rate of $h_1/6$ per hour. The second candle burns in 8 hours, so it burns at a rate of $h_2/8$ per hour.

After 3 hours, the height of the first candle is $h_1 - 3(h_1/6) = h_1 - h_1/2 = h_1/2$.
After 3 hours, the height of the second candle is $h_2 - 3(h_2/8) = h_2 - 3h_2/8 = 5h_2/8$.

We are given that after 3 hours, the heights are the same, so:
$h_1/2 = 5h_2/8$
Multiply both sides by 8:
$4h_1 = 5h_2$
Divide both sides by $h_2$:
$4h_1/h_2 = 5$
Divide both sides by 4:
$h_1/h_2 = 5/4$
The ratio of the initial heights is $h_1:h_2 = 5:4$.
