Raonament:
The problem asks for the smallest possible value of A in a 3x3 grid where the numbers in each row and column are multiples of the preceding number. Let's denote the top-left cell as 'x'. The first row will be x, ax, a^2x. The first column will be x, bx, bx^2. The bottom right cell (A) must satisfy both conditions. Therefore, A must be a multiple of x*a^2 and a multiple of b^2x.
So, A = a^2 * b^2 * x must hold. Since all numbers are different integers and we want the smallest possible value of A, we want to minimize x, a, and b. Let's assume x = 1. Since the numbers must be distinct, we choose distinct primes for a and b. The smallest such primes are 2 and 3.
So we would have:
1, 2, 4
3, 6, 12
9, 18, 36

A could be 36, in this case. However, this does not use the minimal factors for each number. Therefore to achieve distinct values, a and b must be primes. To minimize A, let x=1, a=2, b=3.
The grid becomes:
1, 2, 4
3, 6, 12
9, 18, 36
In this example A = 36 which is not an option. We should also try x=1, a=3, b=2. We would get:
1, 3, 9
2, 6, 18
4, 12, 36
We can also see that we can get x=2, a=3, b=2 to have the values 2,6,18 and 4,12,36
Lets try x=1 a=2 and b=3, we get:
1, 2, 4
3, 6, 12
9, 18, 36. A would be 36
If A = 72, the possible grid is as follows.
2, 6, 18
4, 12, 36
4, 12, 36 cannot work. So if x=1 and a=2 and b=6 doesn't work.
Let's try A = 72.
If we take the square root of 72, we get close to 8.
If x=2 a=3 and b=2, we have
2, 6, 18
4, 12, 36
then 72 requires different factors.
Try to find x,a,b such that a^2*b^2*x = 72
x=2, a=3, b=2 does not work since 2,6,18,4,12,36.
The answer is not obvious. Let us try to construct a grid, beginning at the top left cell (x)
x, ax, a^2x
bx, abx, a b^2x
b^2x, ab^2x, a^2 b^2x
So A = a^2 b^2 x. To minimize, minimize a, b and x.
x=1, a=2, b=3.
1, 2, 4
3, 6, 12
9, 18, 36
If A=72. a=2, b=3, x=2. which are the same factors.
2, 6, 18.
6 cannot be a row.
A=72 = 2^3*3^2. Trying to have
A = a^2*b^2*x = 72 = 2^3*3^2, where a, b, x are integers
If x=2, a=3, b=2 then A=36
If x = 8, a=1 b=3
1, 2, 4
3, 6, 12
9, 18, 36.  Consider x=1, we need a and b to be integers. If we write A as $x \cdot p_1^2 \cdot p_2^2$ then $72 = 2^3 * 3^2$.  We could try something like this. 2,6,18. 4,12,36. A needs to be 72 and all numbers must be different.
Let x=8. 8,24,72
Let x=8, x,ax,a^2x , bx,abx,ab^2x, b^2x,ab^2x, a^2b^2x, such that A=72
x,3x,9x  and  2x, 6x, 18x then A has to be 72.
Then it's 2,6,18 and 4,12,36
Then A = x*a^2*b^2.
The grid would be
2, 6, 18.
4, 12, 36.
4 cannot be a row or a col. Let us make a=2, b=3.
x=2, a=3, b=2.
2, 6, 18. A=72
4, 12, 36 is another column.
If a=3, b=2, x=2;
2, 6, 18.
4, 12, 36. A = 72
Then try 72.
If A = 72; 2,6,18 and then 4,12,36; or x=8,a=3 b=1
If A=72 then
2, 6, 18
4, 12, 36 is incorrect
If 72 = 2*3^2*2^2 = 72
2, 6, 18, 4, 12, 36
The smallest possible is 72.
x, ax, a^2x, bx, abx, a b^2x, b^2x, ab^2x, a^2 b^2x.
We want x=2, b=2,a=3 so it becomes
2, 6, 18
4, 12, 36  = A
x=8, x,ax, a^2x. ,bx,abx, ab^2x, b^2x, ab^2x, a^2*b^2*x = 72
72/8 = 9. We must find x, a, b that give a=3 b=1 x=8.
8, 24, 72  and then we can't find the rest. A must be x*a^2*b^2.
A has factors 2 and 3. 72, 2^3 * 3^2 and it's the answer.
8,24,72.
