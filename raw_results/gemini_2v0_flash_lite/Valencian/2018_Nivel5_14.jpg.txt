Raonament: The question states that the 3-digit number *ab0* is equal to the sum of the cubes of its digits.  This means 100a + 10b + 0 = a³ + b³ + 0³. Simplifying, 100a + 10b = a³ + b³.  The options give the digits of the hundreds place (a), the tens place (b), and the units place. Note that 153 is a number that satisfies this condition: 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153.  So we can infer that the units digits is related to the last digit of the number. So we see that the first digit is a, the second digit is b, and the third digit is 0. The closest to this condition is A. Let's check if it works:

If A) is a, 0, b, this implies the number is a0b.  Then, 100a + b = a³ + 0³ + b³. If the number is 153 (and the question does not specify the number must end in zero), the correct answer would be E) a, 1, b. So the correct order for the digits is a, 1, and b.
If the hundreds digit is 1, the tens is 5 and the units is 3.

Resposta: E) a, 1, b
