Raonament:  The question asks for the minimum percentage reduction in oil consumption needed to prevent the reserves from ever running out, given the current consumption would exhaust the reserves in 50 years.  Any reduction greater than 0% per year, in theory, would prevent the reserves from depleting. However, to prevent the reserves from ever running out, it implies there must be a constant reduction each year. Thus the question is looking for the smallest percentage that would allow the oil reserves to last indefinitely. If the consumption is reduced, then the oil reserves will last longer. If the consumption is not reduced at all, then it would last 50 years.  2% would mean the reserve would reduce slower but eventually deplete. The answer is close to 0% but not exactly 0%.

Resposta: B)
