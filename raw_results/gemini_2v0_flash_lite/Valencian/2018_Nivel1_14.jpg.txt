Raonament: The question asks for the minimum number of turns needed to move the kangaroo from square 1 to square 34. The kangaroo can move forward 7 or 8 squares, or backward 2 squares. To minimize the number of moves, the kangaroo should move forward as much as possible.

Let's denote forward moves as '+' and backward moves as '-'.
1. 4 moves of +8: 1 + 8*4 = 33, then one +1 with one backward move of -2: which means 33-2=31, and another forward move of +7.
2. 34-1=33 squares to cover. Let's try to combine 8 and 7 moves to reach 33: 33=8+8+8+8+1, which is not possible.
33 = 8*3 + 9, which is not possible, since one move is a move of 7. 33= 8*2 + 17 -> this is not possible.
3. Trying to combine +8 moves:
If all moves are +8, then we have x number of +8 moves. The remaining part is 34-1 = 33. Since the kangaroo can either advance 7 or 8 squares:
33 = 8*3 + 9. This needs a +7 move.
So, 3 moves +8, 1 move +7. This would take 4 turns.

Another combination: 33 = 7*4 + 5. Need 5 moves forward, and this is also not possible.
Trying to figure out the number of moves. We want the minimum. We can see that we have 33 steps to go forward.
If we do 3 turns of 8 + 1 turn of 7 = 3*8 + 7 = 24+7=31
Since we end up on the 31st square. We can use the move +7 in the last turn to get us to square 34.
So we can't end at exactly 34. The best combination is 3*8 + 7 = 31. We are at the 31 square and need to reach square 34. We could do 8 in one turn for the 31st move.
The moves are
turn 1: +8 -> square 9
turn 2: +8 -> square 17
turn 3: +8 -> square 25
turn 4: +8 -> square 33.
turn 5: +1 (can't be done)
turn 4: +7-> square 32
turn 5: +2 -> 34, which is incorrect

Let's see 33 steps:
If we do 4 turns of 8.
8*4 = 32
turn 1: +8, position 9
turn 2: +8, position 17
turn 3: +8, position 25
turn 4: +7, position 32
turn 5: backward move by -2, it would land you on the 30.
So that doesn't work.
Then try 33 = 3 *8 + 9. This is not correct.
So
33 = 7*4 +5, is not possible.

The 33 = 8x+7y
33 = 3*7+ 12
33 = 4*7+ 5
33=24+9. 3 moves of +8 and backward move.
Try 3 turns of +7.
7*3=21. Then another turn +8, is 29. another turn +7.

7*3+8*1 = 29.
7*2+8*2=14+16 = 30
turn 1: +8, 9
turn 2: +8, 17
turn 3: +7, 24
turn 4: +8.
So total move is
33 = 8*3 + 9
33 = 7*3 + 12

If we do
8*4 = 32
square number is 1+32 = 33
Then another turn of 2 backwards.

If we do 33. If we always do 8.
4 moves. and then we want to go to 34
4 moves of 8 would give you position 33.
3 moves 8: 24,
1 move 7: 31. So you need to have a +3 move.
Then it is impossible.

7*3=21, 21+13.
1 turn of 7: 8
turn 2: +8: 16
turn 3 +8: 24
turn 4: +8: 32
turn 5: 2 backward move.
Try other combination
4*7= 28.
so total is 5.

So 4 turns of 8 would lead to 33
1. 8
2. 8
3. 8
4. 7.
So we have 4 turns

4 * 8 = 32, position 33
4 + 2  backward move.
So the steps are: 8, 8, 7 ,7, 34.

34-1 = 33

32 + 1, which needs one more.
If 4 steps of +8. This results in 33. Since this is impossible, we need 5 turns

5*5 = 25;

Raonament: The kangaroo must move a total of 33 squares. To minimize turns, maximize the moves with +8. 33 = 8*4 + 1. Since it cannot move +1, it requires the number to be 33.
33/7 and 33/8 are not integers.
4*8=32. So with 4 turns, kangaroo at 33. Then we need 1, so we should take 5 turns to the square 34.
Try 5 turns.
34-1 =33
33= 8*3 +9
8*3+7+2
3 moves *8, 1 move of 7 and -2.
Which is 5 moves.
33 = 8*3+9.
7*4+5
So
turn 1: +8,
turn 2: +8
turn 3: +8
turn 4: +7 = 33
turn 5: +1

Resposta: B)
