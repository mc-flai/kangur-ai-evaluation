Raonament:  This is a permutation with repetition problem. We have 6 cylinders, with 3 blue, 2 green, and 1 yellow. The formula for permutations with repetition is n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!), where n is the total number of items, and n1, n2, ... nk are the counts of each repeated item. In this case, n = 6, n1 = 3 (blue), n2 = 2 (green), and n3 = 1 (yellow).  So the calculation is 6! / (3! * 2! * 1!) = (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1) * 1) = 720 / (6 * 2 * 1) = 720 / 12 = 60.
