Raonament:
1. **Define variables:**
   - Let 'p' be the time (in minutes) for going to the club with skates.
   - Let 'a' be the time (in minutes) for going to the club on foot.
2. **Formulate equations based on the given information:**
   - Equation 1: p (to the club with skates) + a (back on foot) = 40 minutes
   - Equation 2: 2p (going and returning with skates) = 32 minutes. This implies p=16 minutes (32/2)
3. **Solve for 'a':**
    - Using equation 1:
    - Since p = 16, and p+a = 40, then a = 40 - 16 = 24 minutes.
4. **Calculate the time for the entire journey on foot (a to the club and a back):**
   - The time for a round trip on foot would be a + a = 2a = 2 * 24 = 48 minutes.
