Raonament:
The problem defines a new operation denoted by the symbol "◊". The examples provided show the pattern. It seems that `a ◊ b` is calculated as the sum of the integers from `b` down to `a+1`, and then multiply this result by `b`.
Let's apply this rule to `6 ◊ 5`.
The integers between 6 and 5 are:
5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 =  1+2+3+4+5
So, using this sum and the number 5 we have:
(5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1) = (5 + 1)*5/2 = 15. Then multiply by 5.
15 * 5 = 75.

The correct rule should be summing the integers from the second number down to the first number + 1. Then multiplying by the second number.
Then the series sum is 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15.
The rule is: (b + (a+1))* (b-a)* (1/2)
Applying the rule:
a = 6
b = 5
(5 + 6+1) * (5-6)/2 = 8 * -1/2
but this is not correct.
The examples should be the key:
`2 ◊ 3 = (2+1) * 3 = 3*3 = 9`
`4 ◊ 2 = (4 + 3 + 2 + 1)* 2 = 10 * 2 = 20`
`3 ◊ 5 = (3+2+1) * 5 = 6 * 5 = 30`
Then
`6 ◊ 5 = (6+5+4+3+2+1)* 5 = (6+1) * 6/2 *5 = 21 * 5 = 105`
Let's try 6◊5.
We have:
(6+5+4+3+2+1)
sum is 21.
21 * 5 = 105
