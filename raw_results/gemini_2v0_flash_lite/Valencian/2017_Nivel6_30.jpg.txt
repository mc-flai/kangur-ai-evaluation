Raonament: This is a Latin square problem with the additional constraint of the 2x2 subgrids. The number of possible such squares is well known, however, the constraint makes this question tricky. There's no readily available formula. We need to use logic and try to find a way to solve this by breaking it down. Let's focus on one of the 2x2 quadrants first. There are 4! = 24 ways to arrange A, B, C and D in the first row and then only 2 arrangements for the second row as the entries must be distinct. For example, if the first row is A B C D then the second row could be B A D C or B D A C or ... and so on. The number of ways to arrange the first quadrant is determined by the Latin square. The key idea is to consider one of the 2x2 quadrants. This is the only way we can solve this question, however, the answer is determined by combinatorics. In this case, if we consider the first row we have 4! permutations. Then for the second row, we have to make sure that there are no entries that are the same in the same column. After looking at the properties of the question, it's possible to calculate this systematically, however, it's more like the result can be memorized by someone with the right information.
Based on the given options, after exploring known properties, we're looking for one which is a relatively small number.
