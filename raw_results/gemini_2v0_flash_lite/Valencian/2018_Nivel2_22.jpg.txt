1. **Find a side with all three numbers known:** We can see that the sum of the numbers on the sides is 7 + 3 + X.  The side that have values 1, 6 and a missing value.
2. **Find a side that uses 1 and 6:** This means this side is missing a value. We can find the sum of the sides on all sides
3. **Calculate the missing value:** For the side that include 1 and 6, if the sums of three numbers are equal, this missing number must be the same as the result of the calculation for 7+3+X. Let the result from the side with 1 and 6 be y. Then the sum must be y=1+6+X.
    The side that include 7 and 3 are equals to  7+3+X and must be equal to the value of y.
    Then 7+3+X = 10+X; and y=1+6+2.

    Solving the equation 7+3+X = 1+6+2 will give us the X value. Then, we solve for X: 7+3+X = 9, 10+X = 9.
    Solve for X, we find 9-10 = -1;
    So the sum of the sides need to be 1 + 6 + the missing value = 7+3+X = 7+3+2 = 12.

    Then the side to solve the value is 12 = 1+6+5, we have 5.
    Then the next side to solve the value is 2+X+5, 2+X+5 = 12, then X+7 = 12, X = 12-7, X=5.
    then side that we need to find X is equal to 7+3+2=12.

    Then we can compute:
    7 + 3 + 2 = 12
    1 + 6 + 5 = 12
    2 + X + 6 = 12.  So X = 12 - 8 = 4
    X+2+5=12 so 2+5+X=12 then, 7+X=12, X=5
    6+1+5=12. Then we can compute.
    Side 1: 7+3+X = 1+6+Y
    Side 2: 2+X+Y = 7+3+X
    So side 1 and side 2 have same solution.

    We already have 7, 3, 1, 6, 2.
    Side 1 has 7,3,X
    Side 2 has 1,X,6
    1+6+5 = 12
    7+3+2 = 12
    2+x+5=12 , x=5
    1+6+5=12
    6+2+4=12
    7+3+2
    so the X =4

4. **Evaluate the options:** the X must be 4. The sum of each side must be 1+6+5=12. 7+3+2=12, the X value must be 5.
    There is an incorrect value.

5. **Evaluate the options:** We got to the sides and the value must be 4. Then we try the different options:
    A) 7. Side must be 7, then 7+3+7=17 not valid, because have to be equal sum of other side.
    B) 8. Side must be 8, then 7+3+8=18 not valid.
    C) 11. Side must be 11, then 7+3+11=21 not valid
    D) 13. Side must be 13, then 7+3+13=23 not valid.
    E) 15. Side must be 15, then 7+3+15=25 not valid
    Then the problem is wrong?

    Then try to get 7+3+X=1+6+X or 2+X+Y
    7+3+X = 1+6+Y
    10+X=7+X, impossible?
    I think I am missing something?

Let's try the other side again
Side1 7+3+X;
Side 2 1+X+
Side 3  2+X+
Side 4
Side 5
If the sum of all the sides are equals.
Then 7+3+X=1+Y+6. 10+X=7+Y. Y=3+X.
2+X+?

I think I am completely lost?
I am completely lost.

Response: I cannot solve this problem.
