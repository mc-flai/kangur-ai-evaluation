Raonament: The question asks how the F shapes will be reflected in two mirrors. The F shapes are reflected horizontally across the first mirror and then reflected again horizontally across the second mirror, resulting in the first reflection being the reverse of the original and the second reflection being the reverse of the first reflection. The correct image should show an F reflected horizontally on each side of the mirror line, and also the "E" below the "F" shape should be reflected accordingly.

Resposta: B)
