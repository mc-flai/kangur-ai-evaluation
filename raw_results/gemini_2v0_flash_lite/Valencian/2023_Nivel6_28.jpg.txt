Raonament: Let L be the length of the train. Joan walks towards the train and Vicent walks away from the train. Let v be the speed of Joan and Vicent, and V be the speed of the train. Let t_Joan and t_Vicent be the time Joan and Vicent walk, respectively.
Joan walks 45m, so the back of the train travels L-45 in that time: (V-v)*t_Joan = 45
Vicent walks 30m, so the back of the train travels L+30 in that time: (V+v)*t_Vicent = L+30
Since Joan and Vicent start walking at the same time and stop when the end of the train arrives at them, we have t_Joan = t_Vicent = t. Also the problem state that the speed of Joan and Vicent are the same.
Joan walks 45 m: V*t - v*t = 45 or (V-v)*t = L-45
Vicent walks 30 m: V*t + v*t = L+30 or (V+v)*t = L+30
The problem states they are at the same speed so let's call the speed "u".
Joan: u*t = 45
Vicent: u*t = 30
So they walk for the same amount of time, t.
Joan: L - 45 = V*t - u*t = L-45
Vicent: L + 30 = V*t + u*t
Since the speeds are the same. Joan and Vicent moved at the same velocity u, the length of the train that passed is L.
The train covers L-45 meters when Joan walks 45 meters and it cover L+30 meters when Vicent walks 30 meters.
Let t_Joan be the time Joan walks, and t_Vicent the time Vicent walks. The speeds of Joan and Vicent are equal.
t_Joan = 45/u and t_Vicent = 30/u.
Therefore, t_Joan / t_Vicent = 45/30 = 3/2
The relative speed of Joan and Vicent, with respect to the train, is 2v (since the speeds are the same)
Distance Joan traveled = 45
Distance Vicent traveled = 30
Ratio of distances traveled is 45/30 = 3/2. Since they are moving at the same speed, we get 45/30 = 3/2
(V - v)t_Joan = L
(V + v)t_Vicent = L
Since they walk same time, we have L-45 / (L+30) = t_Joan / t_Vicent = 45/30.
Since they are at the same speed:
(V-v)*t_Joan = L
(V+v)*t_vicent = L
Also
(L-45) / (L+30) = 45/30
(L-45) / (L+30) = 3/2
2L - 90 = 3L + 90
3/2
2*(L-45)=3*(L+30)
2L - 90 = L + 30 ->  incorrect
2L - 90 = 3L + 90
3L + 90
2*(L-45)= 3*(L+30)
2L - 90 = 3L +90
L = 180
Thus, Joan walks 45m, Vicent walks 30m. Let the train travel distance L in time T.
Since their walking speeds are the same.
Let the length of the train = x
Since Joan walks 45m, then the remaining length = x-45
Since Vicent walks 30m, then the remaining length = x+30
So we can use the ratio:
(x-45)/45 = (x+30)/30
30*(x-45) = 45*(x+30)
30x-1350 = 45x+1350
15x = -2700  Incorrect
(x-45)/45 = (x+30)/30
2(x-45) = 3(x+30)
2x-90 = 3x + 90
x=-180  Incorrect
(L-45)/30=(L+30)/45
45(L-45)=30(L+30)
45L-2025=30L+900
15L=2925
L=195
Length of train L. Joan moves 45 in the same direction.
L-45 /L+30 = speed
(L-45)/45 = (L+30)/30
30(L-45) = 45(L+30)
30L-1350 = 45L+1350
-2700 = 15L
2L-90 = 3L+90
L = -180  Wrong approach
Joan is walking towards the end so L = 45 + L-x
Vicent is walking away L= 30 + x

When Joan walked 45m and reached the end of train. When Vicent reached the end of train and moved 30 m. Let's call the length L. Then the distance of Joan walking = 45. Distance of vicent walked= 30.
Distance Joan walked + distance traveled by train when Joan moved = train length
L = 45+L-x

Length of train = 150.

(x-45)/45=(x+30)/30. Incorrect!
Train length/speed, speed of walking of Joan/vicent same.

(L-45)/45 = (L+30)/30.
So 30*(L-45)=45(L+30)

So L= 75*3, 30x + 900

Since Joan covers 45 m while the train length travels.
Vicent covers 30 m.
So ratio is 45/30= 3/2.
(L-45)/30 = (L+30)/45.
45*L-45*45 = 30L+900
45L - 30L = 900+2025
15L = 2925
L= 195
(L-45)/45 = (L+30)/30
2(L-45) = 3(L+30)
2L-90 = 3L+90
L=-180

So, (L-45)/L = x/45
L+30/L

Let L be train length. Let v be the speed of Joan and Vicent.
Train speed is V.
Time to travel for joan = T_J = 45/v
Time to travel for vicent = T_V = 30/v
So T_J = 45/v = (L - x)/V
T_V=30/v = L/V
So L = 45/v *V.
30/v
So time t = (L+30)/V
So from joan, time = T_j and distance is 45.  L = X+Y
So for Joan x= 45 so L-45, x,
Vicent, y = 30. L+30.

Let L be the length of the train. Let x be the distance travelled by the train when Joan walks. Let the speed of Joan and Vicent be "v" and speed of train be "V".
When Joan walks, he covers distance 45m. Thus relative speed = V+v
45 = (L) - (45)
(L-45)/(V-v) = time.
(L+30)/(V+v)= time
Since (V+v) is wrong, (v-V) .

Let the length of the train be L. Joan walked 45 m and Vicent walked 30 m. Since Joan and Vicent were walking at the same speed, and assuming the same direction. The relative time for Joan and Vicent must be equal to L. So they travel relative velocity. Since Joan walked and Vicent walked. Joan: L+45
Since they were at the same distance.
When Joan walks 45 m, Train has travelled L-x = x  so  L= x+45.
Vicent 30. Train + 30. so L= 30 -x.   45-30 or L+30
45/L-45=30/L+30
Joan: Time (t) = Distance / Speed = 45 / v. Train (V-v)
L= 75
Then: (V-v)t = L-45.
(v+v)*t = 30
Train time = (L-x)
v = speed.
v=speed.
45/v=x
Joan=45, train has moved.
Vicent is 30 and train+ 30

Joan went 45 and vicent 30
45/(L-x) = 30/(L+x)
(L-45)/45 = (L+30)/30
L=150
So (L-45)/45 = (L+30)/30
2(L-45)= 3L+90
2L-90 = 3L+90
-180 = L wrong.
L=150
(L-45)/L=45/30
150.
x/45= (L+30)/30
x/L-x

(L-45)/45 = (L+30)/30
2(L-45)=3(L+30)
2L-90 = 3L + 90
-L=180
(L-45)/30 = (L+30)/45
45L-2025=30L+900
15L=2925
L=195

L = x +45 . 45+ L-x
L+30. Train goes.
So Length should be in 180
Joan moves 45 m. Vicent moved 30 m.

Length / speed, Joan/Vicent same speed,
L-45 /L+30 = x. L= 150.
So 45/(L-x).
L = 150

When Joan reaches the end of the train, the rear end has moved a distance x such that (x+45) = L.
When Vicent reaches the end of the train, the rear end has moved a distance y such that L+30= y, so L+30.

The total distance travelled by Joan = 45
The total distance travelled by Vicent = 30
45 / (L - 45) = 30 / (L + 30)
Cross Multiply:
45 (L + 30) = 30 (L - 45)
45L + 1350 = 30 L - 1350
45L - 30 L = -1350 - 1350
15L = -2700. Incorrect,
45 / x = 30 / x
(L-45) / 45 = (L+30) / 30
30L - 1350 = 45L + 1350
L =150

Raonament: Joan walks 45 m towards the end of the train, the end of train has moved a distance L-45, and vicent walks 30 m from where they were when the train started to move and when they reached the end. The distance L+30, both walk at same speed. So ratio of distance is the same 45/30. So ratio of distances moved.
So the length is 150
(L-45)/45 = (L+30)/30
2(L-45) = 3(L+30)
2L-90 = 3L + 90
-L=180 wrong.
(L-45)/45 = (L+30)/30
2L-90 = 3L + 90
2L - 3L = 90+90
L=-180. WRONG.
(L-45) / 45 = (L+30) / 30
30L - 1350 = 45L+1350
30L - 45L = 1350+1350.
-15L=2700
45/30 = 3/2
L = 150
150-45= 105,
L=150 is correct.

Resposta: B)
