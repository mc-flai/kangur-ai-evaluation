Raonament: The large rectangle is divided into 7 identical smaller rectangles. The diagram shows a 4 x 3 configuration of the smaller rectangles. Analyzing the configuration:
*   The large rectangle can be split into two rows of equal height, in which the upper row contains 4 smaller rectangles in the horizontal dimension.
*   The question asks for the dimensions of the large rectangle.
*   In the horizontal dimension, the large rectangle contains the length of 4 smaller rectangles. In the vertical dimension, it contains 3 smaller rectangles.
*   From the diagram we can see that the total horizontal number of smaller rectangles would be 4, and the vertical would be 2.
*   Looking at the answer choices, we want to find the dimensions that are compatible with the division into 7 identical rectangles. We can deduce the following from the diagram:
    *   The total area of the large rectangle should be 7.
    *   We need to find which dimensions can be made up of the smaller rectangles, the area has to be a multiple of the number of the smaller rectangles, so the large rectangle must have dimensions which give a multiple of the 7 smaller rectangles.
*   Analyzing the options:
    *   A) 10 x 5 = 50. The rectangle area is not a multiple of 7.
    *   B) 4 x 3 = 12. The rectangle area is not a multiple of 7.
    *   C) 8 x 5 = 40. The rectangle area is not a multiple of 7.
    *   D) 12 x 7 = 84. The rectangle area is a multiple of 7, and could be divided into 7 smaller rectangles, where each has an area of 12. The diagram shows 4 rectangles in the horizontal dimension and 2 in the vertical dimension so the area must be 8.
    *   E) 7 x 3 = 21. The rectangle area is a multiple of 7. These could be the dimensions.

Response: E)
