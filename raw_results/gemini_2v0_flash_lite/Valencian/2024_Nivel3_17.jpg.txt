Raonament: Let's denote the width and height of the rectangle with perimeter 16 as w1 and h1, the width and height of the rectangle with perimeter 18 as w2 and h2, and the width and height of the rectangle with perimeter 24 as w3 and h3, and let the width and height of the unknown rectangle be w4 and h4. From the diagram, we can deduce that the rectangle with perimeter 16 and the rectangle with the unknown perimeter have the same height, i.e., h1 = h4. Also, the rectangles with perimeters 18 and 24 have the same height, i.e., h2=h3. The two taller rectangles are next to each other, so they should have same width, i.e., w2 = w3. Now, since rectangles are adjacent, the height of rectangles 16 and the unknown is equal to height of 18 and 24.
We have following equations for the perimeter:
2(w1+h1) = 16
2(w2+h2) = 18
2(w3+h3) = 24
2(w4+h4) = ?

We also have:
h1=h2=h3=h4, because all the rectangles have a common height.

Given the arrangement, let's name the widths (horizontal) and heights(vertical):
Rectangle with perimeter 16: width=w1, height=h
Rectangle with unknown perimeter: width=w4, height=h
Rectangle with perimeter 18: width=x, height=y
Rectangle with perimeter 24: width=x, height=z
So:
2(w1+h) = 16  =>  w1+h = 8  => w1 = 8-h
2(x+y) = 18  =>  x+y = 9  => x=9-y
2(x+z) = 24  =>  x+z = 12 => x=12-z
From the figure, it appears that the smaller rectangles are arranged in such way the heights are same and the total width of the top rectangles are same to bottom ones, so h=y=z.
From x+y=9 and x+z = 12, and since y=z, we have y = z = 3.
Then x=9-y = 9-3 = 6 and x=12-z = 12-3=9, which seems wrong.

Let height be vertical and width be horizontal.
Let width for the one with perimeter 16 be w1, and height = h
Then perimeter is 2(w1+h) = 16.
Let width for the one with perimeter 18 be x, and height = y.
Then perimeter is 2(x+y)=18.
Let width for the one with perimeter 24 be x, and height = z.
Then perimeter is 2(x+z)=24.
From the figure it is implied, that h = y=z.
Also, from the figure we get:
w1 and x
h, y, z
h=y=z
x+y=9 => x+h = 9
x+z=12 => x+h = 12. Something is wrong.

Assume the two vertical rectangles have same width: x. And the horizontal rectangles have same height, h.
w1+w4 = w2+w3
h=h.
Perimeter: 2(w1+h)=16, 2(x+h)=18 and 2(x+h)=24.
This cannot be!
Let the width be common, so they are vertical.
Perimeter: 2(w1+h) = 16 and 2(x+h) = ? and 2(x+y)=18 and 2(y+w3)=24.
Also x=w1 and height is same.
2w1+2h =16. 2x+2y =18. 2x+2y=24 which is wrong.

Let height be same and width be additive, height h.
Widths: w1, w4
w2, w3
2(w1+h)=16
2(w2+h) = ?
2(w2+h) = 18
2(w3+h) = 24.
h is shared, so w2=w3.
w1+h = 8.
w2+h=9
w3+h=12.
So, w2=w3, which is incorrect.

Width = x, height = y. 16 is w1 and h, 18, x and y. 24, x and z
h is shared, and heights are same. w1+w4=w2+w3
2(x+y)=18, 2x+2z=24.
2(w1+h)=16.
w2+w3
y=z. 18,12, so 2x+18-x=24.
2(x+y)=18 => x+y=9
2(x+y)=24 => x+y=12, wrong
w2=x w3=x w4=x w1=x

Let the height of the two rectangles on top is $a$ and on bottom is $b$.
Perimeters:
$2(w1 + a) = 16$
$2(w2 + b) = 18$
$2(w3 + b) = 24$
$2(w4 + a) = ?$
$w1 + w4 = w2 = w3$. Also, the heights $a=b$.
$w1+a=8$. $w2+a = 9$. $w3+a = 12$. Then $w2=w3$.
$w2+b=9 and w3+b=12. $w2=w3

$w2+b=9, w3+b=12$. $w2=x, w3=x$. $x+b=9 and x+b=12$. incorrect
Heights are $h$ in two rectangles.
If we assume the rectangles are horizontally stacked with their heights aligned.
$2(w1 + h) = 16$
$2(w2 + h) = x$
$2(w3 + y) = 18$
$2(w4 + y) = 24$
$x=y$ heights aligned.
$w1 = w2 = w3 = w4$. No.
Assume that the widths are the same. Then $w1=w2=w3=w4$
2(w+h1) = 16, 2(w+h2) = 18, 2(w+h3) = 24
h1+h4 = 8, h2+h3. $h1+h4 =12$
$16=2(w+h) and 18, 24
2(a+x)=18 and 2(a+y)=24
2(x+h)=18.
18/2= x+h. 24/2 = y+h

Let's suppose the width are horizontal, and heights are aligned. 16, h1, h2, 18, 24
2(x+h)=16 and 2(a+h)=?
2(y+h) = 18
2(z+h) = 24. incorrect. The heights are same, heights are same.
2(w+h1)=16, 2(w+h2)=? , 2(w+h3)
x=y=z, cannot work.
Assume vertical, the widths are the same, and the heights vary.
$P1=16$, $P2=18$, $P3=24$, unknown perimeter
$2l+2w_1=16, 2l+2w_2=18, 2l+2w_3=24, 2l+2w_4 = ?$
$l, w_1, l, w_2, l, w_3, l, w_4$.
The sum of widths must be same.
$w_1+w_4=w_2+w_3$
$2l+2w_1=16$ $l+w_1 = 8$
$2l+2w_2=18, l+w_2 = 9$
$2l+2w_3=24, l+w_3 = 12$
8 = $w_1$
So, w1=x.

Raonament: The figure shows the perimeter of three rectangles that make up a larger rectangle. The question asks for the fourth perimeter. 16, ?, 18, 24. Since we are working with rectangles, and the common side must match between the heights. The heights of the rectangle of 16, and ? must be equal. The height of 18, and 24 must be equal. Let height = h. Then width is w. So for 16. 2w+2h=16, for ? $2(w2+h) = ?$. For 18, $2(w3+h1) = 18. w3+h1 = 9$. $2(w4+h1) = 24$
Since heights are equal, 18/2 - w3 = 9.
16: 2(w1+h) = 16. w1+h = 8.
$2(w1+h)=16$
$2(a+b)=18$
$2(a+c)=24$
$b=c$.
$w2+h$ is the same.
The widths of the top is same as bottom. x +y = x
$w2+h= ?$
$x+h=8$. 2(x+h) =16

So the heights are the same.

Let's calculate:
Let 16 have $w$ and $h$. $2w+2h=16, w+h=8$
$2x+2h=18$, and $2x+2z=24$.
From diagram. h=z. So, x+h=9 and x+z=12 so $x=3$, not possible.
