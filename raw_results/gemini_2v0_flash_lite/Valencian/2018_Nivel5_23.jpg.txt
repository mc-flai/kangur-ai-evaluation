1. **Identify the knowns:** We have triangle ABC with sides AB=16, BC=12, AC=8. MN is parallel to BC, forming triangle AMN. The perimeter of triangle AMN is 27 cm.
2. **Calculate the perimeter of MNCB:** The perimeter of polygon MNCB = MN + NC + CB + BM.
3. **Relate triangles AMN and ABC:** Because MN is parallel to BC, triangles AMN and ABC are similar.
4. **Use similarity to find sides of AMN:** Let's find the perimeter of the triangle ABC: 16+12+8 = 36cm.  Perimeter(AMN) = AM + AN + MN = 27.  Because the triangles are similar and their perimeter is a ratio, we can use the proportions of their sides and perimeters: Perimeter(AMN) / Perimeter(ABC) = AM / AB = AN / AC = MN / BC  -->  27 / 36 = AM/16 = AN/8 = MN/12 --> AM = 12, AN=6, MN=9.
5. **Calculate BM and NC:** Because AM + MB = AB --> 12 + BM = 16 --> BM = 4. Because AN + NC = AC --> 6 + NC = 8 --> NC = 2.
6. **Calculate Perimeter(MNCB):** MNCB = MN + NC + CB + BM = 9 + 2 + 12 + 4 = 27.
