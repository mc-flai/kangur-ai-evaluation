1. **Define variables:** Let the time to go to the school by bus be *B* and the time to walk from the school be *W*.
2. **Translate the given information into equations:**
    *   B + W = 3 hours
    *   2B = 1 hour (since going and returning by bus takes 1 hour)
3. **Solve the equations:**
    *   From 2B = 1, we get B = 0.5 hour.
    *   Substitute B into the first equation: 0.5 + W = 3.
    *   Solve for W: W = 3 - 0.5 = 2.5 hours.
4. **Find the total walking time:** The question asks for the time Joan needs to walk to and from the school, which is 2W, thus 2.5 + 2.5=5
5. **Calculate the final answer:** Total time walking to and from school will be the sum of going and returning walking: W + W = 2.5 + 2.5 = 5.
