Raonament:
1. **Identify the shape:** The figure consists of an equilateral triangle and three semicircles.
2. **Calculate the perimeter of the triangle:** The sides of the triangle are part of the elastic band. Since each side has a length of 2 cm, the total length of the triangle sides is 3 * 2 = 6 cm.
3. **Calculate the circumference of each semicircle:** Each semicircle has a diameter equal to the side of the triangle, which is 2 cm. The radius of each semicircle is 1 cm. The circumference of a full circle would be 2 * π * r = 2 * π * 1 = 2π cm. Since the figure has semicircles, the perimeter of each semicircle would be π * r = π cm.
4. **Calculate the total length of the three semicircles:** Since there are three semicircles each adding a section of the elastic band and all have radius 1, the total length contributed by the semicircles would be 3 * π cm.
5. **Calculate the total length of the elastic band:** Add the contribution of the triangle (already covered by sides) and the perimeter of the three semicircles (since the elastic band passes along those semicircles). The answer is (3 * π ) + (3 * 2 - the three straight sides of the triangle) =  3π + 6
6. **However, upon closer inspection of the figure, the straight edges of the triangle are not part of the elastic band. Only the curved edges of the three semicircles and the outer edges of the triangle are used. The straight edges form the internal part and are not covered by the elastic band.**
7. **Determine which formula gives the desired result:** The perimeter of the triangle is composed by the 3 curved semicircles, which results in a length of 3π (as described in step 4 above), plus the straight line formed by the original triangle, which can be calculated from the perimeter as 2 * 3 = 6. Combining them results in an answer of: 3π + 6. The provided options have the correct expression for the perimeter of the shape. The most similar result is 2π + 3 (incorrect), but it seems that there is an error. The other options are clearly incorrect.

The total length of the elastic band is the sum of the lengths of the three semicircles (3π * 1cm = 3π) and the perimeter of the original triangle = 3*2cm= 6, resulting in 3π + 6. However, this answer is not in any of the options.
D) 2π + 3 is the one closest.
After reconsideration, in the figure provided, the elastic band covers 3 arcs of semi-circles, whose lengths are = 3*π. The perimeter of the original triangle can be seen from the figure to be 2 * 3 = 6cm. Thus the total length of the elastic band is 3π + 6. Again this is not present among the options, closest option is D, even though the answer should be: 3π + 6

The prompt likely is missing or incorrect. Among the answers provided, the closest one is D, even though the answer should be 3π + 6, which is not available among the answers.
