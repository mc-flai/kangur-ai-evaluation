Raonament:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The question asks us to identify which pair of piles cannot be constructed given that Maria has placed the first piece and they are building two piles with 4 white and 4 grey pieces total. The question does not state whether Maria placed a white or grey piece.
2. **Total pieces per colour**: There are 4 white and 4 gray pieces. Each pile will have a maximum of 4 pieces.
3. **Analyzing the Options**: We'll check each option. We need to see if the piles can be built given the number of white and gray pieces available.
    *   **Option A**: The gray pieces add up to 4, so we can distribute the gray pieces and then distribute the white pieces.
    *   **Option B**: The gray pieces add up to 3, so we can distribute the gray pieces and then distribute the white pieces.
    *   **Option C**: The gray pieces add up to 3, so we can distribute the gray pieces and then distribute the white pieces.
    *   **Option D**: The gray pieces add up to 2, so we can distribute the gray pieces and then distribute the white pieces.
    *   **Option E**: The gray pieces add up to 4, so we can distribute the gray pieces and then distribute the white pieces.
4. **Reconsidering that Maria goes first:**. The gray pieces add up to 4 in A and E. If Maria placed the first piece. There can't be 4 gray pieces in one pile if she goes first and only has 4 gray pieces. This eliminates A and E. The other options are all possible. But since the problem requires to identify only one pair, we should try to interpret the question more accurately.
5. **Reinterpreting the Questions:** Maria placed the first piece and it could have been gray or white. So the number of each color can vary between the piles and should result into one pile containing more pieces than the other.
    *  **Option A**:  The first piece of Maria is gray. Then Berta placed the first piece and it could be a white one in any pile. This option can work.
    *  **Option B**:  It can work. Maria place the first piece on the right.
    *  **Option C**:  It can work. Maria place the first piece on the right.
    *  **Option D**:  It can work. Maria place the first piece on the right.
    *  **Option E**:  The first piece of Maria is a gray one. Then the second piece of Berta is a gray piece. Each one has 4 gray pieces, so all 4 pieces of gray are in the right, and then we cannot put a new gray piece. So this is impossible.
