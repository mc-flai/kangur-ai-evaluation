1. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 must be used exactly once in the 2x2 grid.
2. The sum of all the numbers is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
3. Two sums (either row sums or column sums) are 4 and 5.
4. Let the row sums be r1 and r2, and the column sums be c1 and c2. We know two of these sums, for example r1 = 4 and c1=5.
5. We know the sum of all rows is also 10, so r1 + r2 = 10 and hence 4+r2 is a total of 10. Hence r2=6.
6. Similarly, the sum of all columns is also 10, therefore c1+c2=10.
7. We know c1 is 5, thus c2=5.
8. The two missing sums are 6 and 5.
