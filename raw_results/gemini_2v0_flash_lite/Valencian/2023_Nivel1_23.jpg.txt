The number of times the cuckoo clock strikes follows a pattern. We are given the number of strikes at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 o'clock. These values form a sequence: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15.  The difference between consecutive terms are 2, 3, 4, 5. This indicates that the number of strikes is the sum of consecutive integers from 1 to the hour the clock strikes. We need to calculate the total strikes at 8 o'clock, so we need to find the sum 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8. This can be calculated as the sum of the first 8 natural numbers, which is n(n+1)/2 = 8*(8+1)/2 = 8*9/2 = 72/2 = 36.
