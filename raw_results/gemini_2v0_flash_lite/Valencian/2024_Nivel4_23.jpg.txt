Raonament: The problem states that Laura scored 3/20 of the total points and Gemma scored 1/5 of the total points. It also says that Laura was the player who scored the fewest points, and Gemma the player who scored the most. We don't have information to deduce the number of players, so we assume that the minimum number of players possible is what is sought. Since Laura is the lowest scorer and Gemma the highest, and they both scored, there must be at least one more player to complete the team. A basketball team is formed by 5 players.

Resposta: A) 5
