Raonament:  To solve this problem, we need to find an arrangement of the numbers 1 through 7 in the circles of the triangle such that the sum of the numbers in each of the five lines is the same. The central number is shared by three lines, while the corner numbers are shared by two lines each, and the other two numbers are shared by one line each. We can use a trial-and-error method combined with logic to deduce the center number. The sum of 1 to 7 is 28. If we consider placing 4 in the centre, this would mean we need to aim for sums that are somewhat bigger than the average of 28/5, i.e. larger than 5.

We consider 6 in the question mark circle.
