Raonament: Let 'x' be the number of apples Andreu has in each pile.  Andreu has 6 piles, so he has 6x apples. Biel has the same total number of apples. Biel has 5 piles and each pile has 2 more apples than Andreu, so each of Biel's piles has x + 2 apples. Biel has 5(x+2) apples.  Since they have the same number of apples: 6x = 5(x+2).  6x = 5x + 10.  x = 10. Andreu has 6 piles * 10 apples/pile = 60 apples.
