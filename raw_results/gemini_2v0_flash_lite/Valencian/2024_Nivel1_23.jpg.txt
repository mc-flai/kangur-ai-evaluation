Raonament:
1. **Analyze the first scale:** The first scale has balls A and D on one side and the scale is balanced.
2. **Analyze the second scale:** The second scale has balls E, C, and B on one side, and it's balanced, so they should have the same total weight as the other side in the scale with A and D.
3. **Analyze the third scale:** The third scale has balls E and B on one side and is higher than the side with balls A and C, this indicates that the balls E and B together are lighter than A and C together.
4. **Deduce the weights based on the instructions:** We know that one ball weighs 30g, three weigh 50g, and one weighs 80g.
5. **Deduce the weight of the balls:**
    *   From the first scale, we know that A and D have the same weight.
    *   In the third scale, it indicates that A and C have a higher weight than E and B together. So the balls E and B have to be 50 g.
    *   Therefore, the remaining ball has to be 30g.
    *   From the second scale, we know that we have A and D on one side, we can deduce that the only option is that balls A or D have to be the 30g ball. But as we know that the weight is distributed by the scale, it does not have any specific indications.
    *   Then we can see that balls A and C are in the third scale, and if we consider A the 30g ball, then C has to be 80g. Then we know that E and B have 50g each.
    *   Finally we can see that the ball that weights 30g is **A**
