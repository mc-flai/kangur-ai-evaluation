Raonament:
The strip of paper is folded so that a right angle is formed. The length of the paper is 12 cm and the width is 2 cm.  The width of the paper determines the height and width of the two rectangular sections in the folded figure. A right triangle is created by the segment XY, as well as the two segments of the strip, which become the legs. The folded strip creates a right triangle with a 45-degree angle, meaning it is an isosceles right triangle. The legs of this triangle are equal in length. The segment XY is the hypotenuse.

Let the length of the shorter side of the two rectangles be 'a'. Thus, the length of the remaining paper, after the folding, becomes '12 - 2a'.

The area of each rectangle is 2 cm x a. We are given that the total length is 12, and the width is 2. Hence, the total length of the folded paper can be broken down in 2 ways. Thus:
2a + 12-2a, with the base of the triangle being (12-2a) = a. Thus, 12=2a, a=6.

The base of the triangle is a. The height is also 'a'. The total length is 12 cm, therefore the remaining length is 12-2=10 cm, hence a value of a=10.

The right-angled triangle made has lengths 6 cm and 6 cm because it is a 45-degree triangle. The length of X-Y is then, using the Pythagoras theorem, which gives XY = sqrt(6^2 + 6^2) = sqrt(72) = sqrt(36 * 2) = 6√2.
Therefore, 6√2 is our answer.
