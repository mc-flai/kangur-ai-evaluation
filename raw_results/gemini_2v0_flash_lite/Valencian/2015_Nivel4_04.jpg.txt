Raonament: If three Sundays fall on a day with an even number, then the Sundays must fall on the 2nd, 16th, and 30th of the month. Since the question asks for the day of the week of the 20th, the 20th would fall on the same day of the week as the 2nd, plus 18 days. That would fall on the 1st Sunday of the month if added. The 2nd is a Sunday, the 9th is a Sunday, and the 16th is a Sunday. The 20th would be a Thursday.
