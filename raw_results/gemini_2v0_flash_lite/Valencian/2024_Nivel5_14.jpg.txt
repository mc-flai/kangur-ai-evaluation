Raonament:
Let Maria's current age be M, her daughter's current age be D, and her granddaughter's age be 0.
The problem states that M and D are even numbers.
In two years, Maria's age will be M+2, her daughter's age will be D+2, and the granddaughter's age will be 2.
The product of their ages in two years will be 2024, so (M+2)(D+2)(2) = 2024.
Therefore, (M+2)(D+2) = 1012.
Since M and D are even, M+2 and D+2 are also even.
We must find two even factors of 1012.
1012 = 2 * 506 = 2 * 2 * 253 = 2 * 2 * 11 * 23
We can try different combinations:
If M+2 = 22 and D+2 = 46, then M = 20 and D = 44. But this is not possible as the daughter is older than the mother.

If we try values for M, we can deduce the correct one through the options:
A) If M=42, (42+2)(D+2) = 1012  =>  44(D+2)=1012  =>  D+2 = 23, D = 21.  This is impossible as D should be an even number
B) If M=44, (44+2)(D+2) = 1012  =>  46(D+2) = 1012  => D+2 = 22, D = 20.
C) If M=46, (46+2)(D+2) = 1012 => 48(D+2) = 1012  =>  D+2 = 1012/48 which is not an integer.
D) If M=48, (48+2)(D+2) = 1012  =>  50(D+2) = 1012, then D+2 = 1012/50 which is not an integer.
E) If M=50, (50+2)(D+2) = 1012  => 52(D+2) = 1012, then D+2 = 1012/52, this is not an integer.
The only possible option, is B) where M = 44 and D = 20.
The daughter is 20 years old, which is also older than the granddaughter (0).

Resposta: B)
