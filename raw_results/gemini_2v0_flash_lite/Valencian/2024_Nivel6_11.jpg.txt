Raonament: The question asks which property a positive integer `n` satisfies, knowing it meets only one of the properties. Looking at the options:
*   A) `n` is divisible by 3. This can be 3, 6, 9, etc.
*   B) `n` is divisible by 6. This means `n` is also divisible by 3 and 2. This is more specific than A.
*   C) `n` is prime. This is a specific set of numbers.
*   D) `n` is odd. This can be 1, 3, 5, 7, etc.
*   E) `n` = 2. This is the most specific, the only possibility is 2.

If `n=2`, then the only true statement would be E, n = 2.
