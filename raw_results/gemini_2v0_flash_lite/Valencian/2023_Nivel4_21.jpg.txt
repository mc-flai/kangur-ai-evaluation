1. **Define Variables**: Let the distance between P and Q be D. Let Cris's speed be Vc and Roc's speed be Vr.
2. **Calculate Speeds**: We know Cris takes 60 minutes (1 hour), and Roc takes 90 minutes (1.5 hours). Thus, Vc = D/1 and Vr = D/1.5.
3. **Relative Speed**: Since they are moving towards each other, their speeds add up. The relative speed is Vc + Vr = D/1 + D/1.5 = D + (2/3)D = (5/3)D.
4. **Time to Meet**: Time = Distance / Relative Speed. The total distance to be covered is D. So, time = D / ((5/3)D) = 3/5 hours.
5. **Convert to Minutes**: (3/5) hours * 60 minutes/hour = 36 minutes.
6. **Meeting Time**: They started at 10:00 AM. They meet 36 minutes later, at 10:36 AM.
