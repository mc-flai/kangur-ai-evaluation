Raonament:
1.  Let's define the weight of a nail as 'c' and the weight of a snail as 's'.
2.  We can formulate two equations based on the given information:
    *   c + 2s = 12
    *   2c + 5s = 29
3.  We can solve this system of equations. Multiply the first equation by 2:
    *   2c + 4s = 24
4.  Subtract the new equation from the second equation:
    *   (2c + 5s) - (2c + 4s) = 29 - 24
    *   s = 5
5.  Substitute s = 5 into the first equation:
    *   c + 2(5) = 12
    *   c + 10 = 12
    *   c = 2
6.  Now, we want to find the weight of 3 nails and 4 snails:
    *   3c + 4s = 3(2) + 4(5) = 6 + 20 = 26
