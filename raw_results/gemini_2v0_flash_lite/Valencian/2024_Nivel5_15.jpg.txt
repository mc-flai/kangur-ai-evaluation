Raonament: In an equilateral triangle, if we draw three segments from a point inside parallel to the sides, the sum of the lengths of these segments is equal to the height of the triangle. The perimeter of the triangle is three times the side length. Also, the sum of the segment lengths is equal to the height of the triangle. Since all sides of the triangle have the same height, we know that the sum of the segments 2+3+6=11 is actually the height of the triangle. The sides of an equilateral triangle are all of the same length. However, since these segments make a partition of the triangle height, and this height is the same for any side, we have that the side length is the sum of the segments drawn parallel to each side, so the perimeter is equal to 3 times the sum of the segments, so it is 3*(2+3+6) m = 3 * 11 = 33.
