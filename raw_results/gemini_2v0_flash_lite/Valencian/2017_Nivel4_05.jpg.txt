Raonament:
Let's denote the initial amount of money Noa and Jaume each have as x. After spending, Noa has x-7 and Jaume has x-4. The problem states that Jaume has twice as much money as Noa at the end.  Therefore, x-4 = 2(x-7).  Solving this equation: x-4 = 2x - 14 => x = 10.
The question asks the total amount of money they had at the beginning. That would be x + x = 2x.
Since x=10, then the initial total is 2 * 10 = 20.
