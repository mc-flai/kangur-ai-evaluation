Raonament:
1. Let's denote the number of problems solved by each person as follows:
   - J = Joan
   - P = Pau
   - C = Clara
   - T = Tomàs
2. From the given information, we can write the following equations:
   - P = J + 8  (Pau solved 8 more problems than Joan)
   - P = C + 11 (Pau solved 11 more problems than Clara)
   - T = J + 3 (Tomàs solved 3 more problems than Joan)
3. We want to find the difference between the number of problems solved by Tomàs and Clara (T - C).
4. From the equations above, we can express J in terms of P: J = P - 8.
5. Also, T - C = (J+3) - (P-11) = J+3-C . From P=C+11 means  C=P-11 and from P=J+8 means  J=P-8. Then T-C = J+3-C= (P-8)+3-(P-11)= P-8+3-P+11=6
6. Thus, the difference between the number of problems solved by Tomàs and Clara is 6.
