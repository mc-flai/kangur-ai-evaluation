Raonament: We can apply the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. There are 2016 inhabitants, and their ages are between 0 and 49 inclusive, which gives us 50 possible ages (49 - 0 + 1 = 50). We are looking for the minimum number of inhabitants that MUST have the same age. If we divide the number of inhabitants by the possible number of ages, we get 2016 / 50 = 40.32. This means that if we distributed the inhabitants evenly among the ages, we'd have at least 40 in each age group. However, since the result is not an integer, there is at least one age group which has at least 41 inhabitants, so the answer is 40 +1 = 41. We look for options where we can guarantee that at least some number of people share the same age. We can be certain that al menys 41 people have the same age, but we cannot be sure that they share the same age group. We can be certain that at least 42 have the same age.
