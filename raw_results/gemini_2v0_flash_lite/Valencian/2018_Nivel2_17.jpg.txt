1. **Define Variables:** Let 'x' be the number of girls and '2x' be the number of boys (excluding Anna, as she is a girl).
2. **Use the Information about 10 More Boys:**  The problem states there are 10 more boys than girls. Since Anna is a girl, and the number of boys excludes Anna, the equation is 2x = x + 10.
3. **Solve for x:**  Subtract 'x' from both sides: x = 10. This means there are 10 girls (including Anna).
4. **Find the Number of Anna's Female Classmates:** Anna is one of the 10 girls, so the number of other girls in the class is 10 - 1 = 9.
