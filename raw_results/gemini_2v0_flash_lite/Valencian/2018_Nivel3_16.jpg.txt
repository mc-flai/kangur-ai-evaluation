1. **Define variables:** Let 'x' be the number of boys and 'y' the number of girls.
2. **Translate the information into equations:**
   * "La meitat dels xics i una tercera part de les xiques... en total, 12 alumnes":  (x/2) + (y/3) = 12
   * "En aquesta classe, tantes xiques com xics no han participat en la competici√≥.": The number of girls who didn't participate is x/2 and the number of boys who didn't participate is (2/3)y. They are equal: (x/2) = (2/3)y or 3x = 4y
3. **Solve the system of equations:**
   * From the second equation, x = (4/3)y. Substitute this into the first equation:
     * ((4/3)y / 2) + (y/3) = 12
     * (2/3)y + (y/3) = 12
     * y = 12 * (3/3) = 12
   * Solve for x:
     * x = (4/3) * 12 = 16
4. **Calculate the total number of students:** The total is x + y = 16 + 12 = 28
