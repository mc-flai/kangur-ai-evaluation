1. **Identify the diameter:** The diagonal of the rectangle is the diameter of the circumscribed circle.
2. **Calculate the diagonal:** Use the Pythagorean theorem: diagonal² = 10² + 24² = 100 + 576 = 676. So, the diameter is √676 = 26 cm.
3. **Calculate the radius:** The radius is half the diameter: 26 cm / 2 = 13 cm.
4. **Determine the height (h):**  The height 'h' is the radius minus half the length of the rectangle.  The major segments are created by considering the rectangle's smaller side. We see the height is the radius minus half the smaller side of the rectangle (10/2=5). h=13-5=8.
