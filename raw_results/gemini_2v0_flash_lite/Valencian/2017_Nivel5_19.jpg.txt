Raonament: Let the 6-digit number be represented as abcde4. Moving the 4 to the beginning, the new number is 4abcde. The problem states that 4abcde = 4 * abcde4. Let's denote the number abcde as x. Then the original number is 10x + 4 and the new number is 400000 + x. The problem statement translates to:
400000 + x = 4 * (10x + 4)
400000 + x = 40x + 16
399984 = 39x
x = 399984 / 39
x = 10256

So, abcde = 10256. The original number is 102564 and the new number is 410256. Let's check: 4 * 102564 = 410256.
The third digit of the menor nombre is 2.
