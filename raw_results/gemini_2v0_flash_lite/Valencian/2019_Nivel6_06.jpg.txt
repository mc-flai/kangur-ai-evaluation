1.  **Identifying the known numbers:** From the image we can identify the following partial numbers: 7243, 21\_, \_26.
2.  **Finding the missing numbers:** We know the sum of the three numbers is 11126. We can set up the addition problem, filling in the known digits:
    ```
       7243
       21_
     + _26
     ------
      11126
    ```
3.  **Starting from the units column (rightmost):**  3 + _ + 6 must result in a number ending in 6. Thus, the missing digit must be 7 (3+7+6=16).  We carry-over the 1.
4.  **Next column (tens):** 4+1+2+1(carry-over) = 8. We need to obtain a 2, so the missing digit has to be 4 (8+4=12). We carry-over 1.
5.  **Next column (hundreds):** 2 + _ + 1(carry-over) = 11, so the missing number must be 8.
    ```
        7243
        2147
     +  826
      ------
      11126
    ```
6.  **Final step:** The hidden numbers are 4, 7 and 8.  However, among the options the hidden numbers are 4, 5 and 7. Checking each option is not possible as the sum is already solved.
7. Consider this: if there is an error and the sum is not important. The hidden digits are: units digit of the second number is 7; hundreds digit of the third number is 4; the missing digit in the second number can be: 5. We already have 4, 7. We need 5.
