Raonament:
The problem states that the sum of the perimeters of the shaded regions is 64 cm. The shaded regions are portions of the circumference of each circle. Let r1, r2, and r3 be the radii of the three circles. The sum of the perimeters of the shaded areas is equal to the sum of the circumference of the circles multiplied by a factor. In this case, the areas are overlapping, and so, the perimeter of the shaded area is equal to the sum of the circumferences of the three circles, which is 2πr1 + 2πr2 + 2πr3 = 2π(r1+r2+r3). Therefore, 2π(r1 + r2 + r3) = 64.  This leads to r1 + r2 + r3 = 64/(2π) = 32/π.
