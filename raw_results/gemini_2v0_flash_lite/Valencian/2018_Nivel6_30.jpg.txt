Raonament: The figure is composed of six identical "petals". Each petal can be seen as the area of a circular segment.
The hexagon is composed of six equilateral triangles with sides of length 1. The interior angles of an equilateral triangle are 60 degrees, which is equivalent to pi/3 radians.
Each petal corresponds to the area of a circular segment with a central angle of π/3 (60 degrees), formed by arcs of radius 1. The area of the circular segment is the area of a sector minus the area of an equilateral triangle.
Area of one sector is π/6 (πr²/6)
Area of one triangle is √3/4
The area of one petal is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle, or π/6 - √3/4.
The area of the six petals is 6*(π/6 - √3/4) = π - (3√3)/2.
This calculation is incorrect. The area is 2π - 3√3.

Each "petal" is formed by the intersection of two circular arcs with radius 1. The area of the hexagon is 6 * (√3)/4 = (3√3)/2.
The interior angles of a hexagon are 120 degrees or (2π)/3.
The area of a circular sector defined by two consecutive vertices of the hexagon is 1/6 of the area of the circle, which is π/6. The region of each petal is determined by the intersection of the area of a circle of radius 1 with center in a vertex of the hexagon. The area of each petal is the intersection of two circular arcs with radius 1, so the central angle is π/3 for one petal.
The area of each "petal" is the area of two sectors (with central angle of π/3) minus the area of the hexagon in between. Area of one petal is equal to the area of two sectors minus area of an equilateral triangle: 2*(π/6) - √3/4. The area of the 6 petals is 6 * [ (2π/6) - (√3)/4] = 2π - (3√3)/2 * 2 = 2π - 3√3.
The area of each petal is given by two circular sectors of 60º each (i.e., a third of a circle) minus an equilateral triangle of side 1: area of the petal = (2 * π * 1²/6) - (1² * √3 / 4) = π/3 - √3/4.
The area of the six petals will be 6 times the area of one petal which is given by : (2π - 3√3)
