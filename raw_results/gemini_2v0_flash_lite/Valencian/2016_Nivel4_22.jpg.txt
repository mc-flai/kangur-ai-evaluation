1. **Files:** There are 33 rows. The numbers not multiples of 3 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, ..., 32, 33.  There are 22 numbers not multiples of 3 (33 - 11 = 22, or 33/3 * 2 = 22).
2. **Columns:** There are 21 columns. The even numbered columns are 2, 4, 6, ..., 20. There are 10 even-numbered columns.
3. **Painted cells:** Painted cells are: (22 rows * 10 columns) + (11 rows * 10 columns) + (22 rows * 11 columns) =
(11 rows * 10 columns) + (22 rows * 11 columns)  =
(22 * 10) + (10*33)
4. **Cells not painted:** Total cells = 21 columns * 33 rows = 693.  Cells not painted are where row number is a multiple of 3 and column number is odd. Multiples of 3 for rows: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33. Odd numbered columns: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21. Number of cells not painted = 11 rows * 11 columns = 121.
