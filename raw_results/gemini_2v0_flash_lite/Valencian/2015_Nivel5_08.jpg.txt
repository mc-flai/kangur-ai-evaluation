1. **Calculate the volume of the liquid:** When the box rests on the 8 cm x 12 cm face, the liquid reaches a height of 10 cm. The volume of the liquid is 8 cm * 12 cm * 10 cm = 960 cm³.
2. **Calculate the height when resting on the 8 cm x 15 cm face:**  The volume of the liquid remains the same.  When the box rests on the 8 cm x 15 cm face, let the height be 'h'. The volume is 8 cm * 15 cm * h = 960 cm³.
3. **Solve for h:**  120h = 960 => h = 960 / 120 => h = 8 cm.
