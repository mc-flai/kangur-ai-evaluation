Raonament: The question asks which of the given shapes cannot be transformed from the shape on the right by bending/manipulating the rope, but without cutting it. By visualizing and attempting to "reshape" the shape on the right, into each option. The shape in the right is essentially an infinity symbol. Option A is a figure eight wrapped around itself and can be made from the infinity symbol. Options B, C and D are also possible to make by modifying the shape in the right. However, Option E, the "figure eight" stacked on top of each other, has a different crossing of loops and therefore can't be transformed from the initial infinity symbol.

Resposta: E)
