Raonament: The question asks how many years in the 21st century (years 2001-2100) have a digit sum of 4. Since the first two digits are always 2 and 0, we need the last two digits to sum to 2, and we add them to the other two digits (2 + 0 = 2), that has to sum 4. We have to find the numbers in this range (2001-2100) where the sum of the digits is 4.
The years that satisfy this condition are:
*   2002 (2+0+0+2=4)
*   2011 (2+0+1+1=4)
*   2020 (2+0+2+0=4)
*   2030 (2+0+3+0=5), this does not sum 4.
*   2101 (2+1+0+1=4)
*   2110 (2+1+1+0=4)

So there are 5 years in the range 2000-2100 (years 2001-2100) where the sum is 4. However, 2030 does not sum 4, therefore the only years that work are 2002, 2011, 2020, 2101, 2110. In the text, there are only 4 numbers

The years in the 21st century (2001-2100) where the sum of the digits is 4 are:
2002 (2+0+0+2 = 4)
2011 (2+0+1+1 = 4)
2020 (2+0+2+0 = 4)
2101 (2+1+0+1 = 4)
There are 4 such years.
