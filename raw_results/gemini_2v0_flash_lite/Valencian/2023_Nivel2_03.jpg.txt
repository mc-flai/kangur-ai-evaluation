Raonament:
The question relates the area within a square, and the number of matches needed to create that square. The initial figure has 25 circles inside, which means a 5x5 grid fits inside.
If we need to fit 100 circles inside the new square figure, and the matches are placed in the shape of a square, we have to consider the number of circles that could fit inside.
The 100 circles would arrange in a 10x10 grid.
If we have to calculate how many matches we would need to form a 10x10 grid, we can consider how the edges are built.
With 10x10, it is easy to deduce that there will be 10 matches on each side.
If we want to know the amount of matches, we would consider how to create a square with 10 rows and 10 columns.
A 10x10 arrangement would need 11 rows and 11 columns in matches.
We can see that the answer must be calculated as 11 + 11 + 11 + 11 = 44.
The closest answer is 12, but it's not 12 matches, it's the amount of matches per side.
If we calculate 100 fitxes inside, this means that we would have a 10 x 10 fitxes.
Therefore, on each side, there are 10 matches. The question says the square. So the total number of matches must be 4 sides * matches per side.
As the options are the amount of matches for each side, we consider that there would be a total of 10 + 1 matches in each direction.
If we consider 100 fitxes, we would have 10x10 grid, therefore 11 matches for each side, considering the matches used to make the sides
4 * 11 = 44, which is not an option.
A 10x10 grid inside requires a side that fits a 10x10 grid.
We can assume that this is a 10x10, and each side has 10 matches. The options give the matches on each side, therefore 10 is correct.
For a square shape to contain 100 circles, it must be 10 x 10, which means 11 matches must be in the rows and in the columns. Therefore, 10 is the closest and the best option.
