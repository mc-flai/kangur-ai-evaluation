1.  **Find the largest 3-digit number:** To maximize the number, the first digit should be as large as possible. Since the sum of the digits must be 8, the largest first digit is 8. The other digits must be zero. Thus, the largest number is 800.
2.  **Find the smallest 3-digit number:** The smallest 3-digit number starts with the smallest possible digit (1). We need the sum of digits to be 8. Thus, the second digit could be 0, 1, 2 ... and the third digit will add up the sum to 8. If the first digit is 1, the second digit should be 0 and the third digit should be 7 (1 + 0 + 7 = 8). Thus the smallest number is 107.
3.  **Calculate the sum:** 800 + 107 = 907
