Raonament: This is a permutation with repetition problem. We have 5 total cubes (3 red and 2 white). The formula for permutations with repetition is n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!), where n is the total number of items, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the counts of each repeated item. In this case, n = 5, n1 = 3 (red cubes), and n2 = 2 (white cubes). So, the calculation is 5! / (3! * 2!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1)) = 120 / (6 * 2) = 120 / 12 = 10.
