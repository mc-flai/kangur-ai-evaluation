Raonament: Let the side of the equilateral triangle be 'x'. We cut out 3 smaller triangles with sides 1, 2, and 3 respectively.  The perimeter of the resulting hexagon is equal to the sum of the perimeters of the three cut-out triangles. The perimeter of the hexagon is equal to the original triangle side length minus the sides cut from 3 of the sides. Let's define the side of the hexagon as y. Then, the hexagon's perimeter is 3*y. Also, the sum of the perimeter of the cut triangles is: 3+6+9 = 18.
Since the perimeter of the hexagon is equal to the sum of the perimeters of the smaller triangles:
Perimeter of hexagon = perimeter of the small triangles
3y=18
y = 6 cm
To get y, we need to remove the parts that have 1, 2 and 3 cm sides, so the total cut out is 1+2+3=6.  Now we need to determine the value of x.
x = y + 1 + 2 + 3
x = 6 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 12 cm
