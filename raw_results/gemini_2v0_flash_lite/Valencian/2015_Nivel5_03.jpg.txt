Raonament: To solve this problem, we need to determine which inequality is not satisfied by a number that satisfies the other four. Let's simplify each inequality:

A) x < -3
B) x + 3 > 0  =>  x > -3
C) 1 - x < 7  => -x < 6  => x > -6
D) 3x > -6  => x > -2
E) -2x < 5  => x > -2.5

Now, we need to find a value that satisfies four of the inequalities and not the fifth.  Let's try to find a number that satisfies B, C, D and E. 
If x = -2.4:
A) -2.4 < -3 (False)
B) -2.4 > -3 (True)
C) -2.4 > -6 (True)
D) -2.4 > -2 (False)
E) -2.4 > -2.5 (True)

Let's consider x = -2.1:
A) -2.1 < -3 (False)
B) -2.1 > -3 (True)
C) -2.1 > -6 (True)
D) -2.1 > -2 (False)
E) -2.1 > -2.5 (True)

If the value is between -2.5 and -3, then it satisfies all except B, C, D and E

If x = -3.5:
A) -3.5 < -3 (True)
B) -3.5 > -3 (False)
C) -3.5 > -6 (True)
D) -3.5 > -2 (False)
E) -3.5 > -2.5 (False)

Based on these results, the inequality that's not satisfied is  x < -3. Let us consider the interval where the solution lies. A suitable x must satisfy x > -3, x > -6, x > -2, x > -2.5, and does not satisfy x < -3. It must be in the range (-2.5, -2).

Let's consider the answer to be A.
