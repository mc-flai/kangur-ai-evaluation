Let $n$ be the number of sides (and vertices) of the polygon.
The number of sides is $n$.
The number of diagonals is given by the formula $\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$.
The sum of the number of sides and the number of diagonals is 28. Therefore, we have:
$n + \frac{n(n-3)}{2} = 28$
Multiply by 2:
$2n + n(n-3) = 56$
$2n + n^2 - 3n = 56$
$n^2 - n = 56$
$n^2 - n - 56 = 0$
We can solve this quadratic equation for $n$. We are looking for integer solutions since $n$ represents the number of vertices. We can factor the quadratic:
$(n - 8)(n + 7) = 0$
The solutions are $n = 8$ or $n = -7$.
Since the number of vertices must be a positive integer, we have $n = 8$.
The number of vertices is 8.
