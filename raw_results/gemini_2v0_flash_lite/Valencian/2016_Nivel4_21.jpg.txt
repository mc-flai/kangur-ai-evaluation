1. **Initial Price:** Assume the price of oil three weeks ago was 100.
2. **First Increase:** Two weeks ago, the price increased by 20%.  100 + (20% of 100) = 100 + 20 = 120.
3. **Second Increase:** One week ago, the price increased by 25%.  120 + (25% of 120) = 120 + 30 = 150.
4. **Decrease:** Yesterday, the price decreased by 20%. 150 - (20% of 150) = 150 - 30 = 120.
5. **Calculate the percentage change:**  The final price is 120, while the initial was 100.  ((120-100)/100) * 100 = 20%. Therefore the final price represents an increase of 20%.
