1.  **Understanding the problem:** The problem states that the number of sheep is divisible by both 15 and 16, and the number is between 300 and 600.
2.  **Finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM):** To find a number divisible by both 15 and 16, we need to find their LCM.
    *   Prime factorization of 15: 3 x 5
    *   Prime factorization of 16: 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 2^4
    *   LCM(15, 16) = 2^4 x 3 x 5 = 16 x 15 = 240.
3.  **Finding multiples within the range:** Now we look for multiples of 240 within the range of 300 and 600.
    *   240 x 1 = 240 (too small)
    *   240 x 2 = 480 (within the range)
    *   240 x 3 = 720 (too large)
4.  **Solution:** The only multiple of 240 that falls between 300 and 600 is 480.
