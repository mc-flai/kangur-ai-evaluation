1. **Determine the rectangle's dimensions:** The problem states the length of the rectangle is 36 cm. The height is found by adding the distances from the large semicircle to the side of the rectangle (7 cm) and the radius of the smallest semicircle (7cm), so the height is 7 + 7 + 5 = 19cm.
2. **Calculate the perimeter:** The perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2 * (length + width).  Therefore, the perimeter is 2 * (36 + 19) = 2 * 55 = 110.  However, 110 is not a possible answer.  The height calculation is incorrect. The height is 7 cm + 5 cm = 12 cm. The perimeter then is 2*(36+12) = 2*48= 96
