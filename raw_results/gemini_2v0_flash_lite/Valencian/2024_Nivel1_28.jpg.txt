Raonament:
1. **Calculate the number of won games:** Magnus won half of his games, so he won 1/2 * (number of games played).
2. **Calculate the number of lost games:** He lost one-third of his games, so he lost 1/3 * (number of games played).
3. **Set up an equation:** Let 'x' be the number of games played. Then, x = (x/2) + (x/3) + 2.
4. **Solve the equation:**
    * Multiply the equation by 6 to eliminate fractions: 6x = 3x + 2x + 12
    * Simplify: 6x = 5x + 12
    * Subtract 5x from both sides: x = 12
5. **Calculate the number of games remaining:** Magnus has to play 15 games in total and has played 12, so he has 15 - 12 = 3 games remaining.
