Raonament: The speed of a point on a rotating disc is proportional to its distance from the center. Let d be the distance of the closer point from the center. Then the distance of the further point from the center is d+3. The speed of the further point is 2.5 times faster, so d+3 = 2.5d.  Solving for d, we get 1.5d = 3, so d=2. Then d+3 = 2+3 = 5 cm.
