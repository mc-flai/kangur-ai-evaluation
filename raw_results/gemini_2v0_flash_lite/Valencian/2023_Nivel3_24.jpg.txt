1. **Understanding the Problem:** The problem describes the ages of Maria, Joan, and their mother at different points in time. We are given relationships between their ages and asked to find Joan's age.

2. **Translating the Information:**
    *   "Quan va nàixer Joan, l'edat de Maria era un terç de l'edat que llavors tenia la mare." - When Joan was born, Maria's age was one-third the mother's age at that time.
    *   "Hui l'edat de Maria és la meitat de l'edat que ara té la mare." - Today, Maria's age is half of the mother's current age.

3. **Formulating Equations/Logic:**
    *   Let M = Maria's current age.
    *   Let J = Joan's age.
    *   Let M_m = Mother's current age.

    From "Hui l'edat de Maria és la meitat de l'edat que ara té la mare.":  M = M_m / 2.  Therefore, M_m = 2M

    When Joan was born, Maria was J years old. So, the mother's age then was M_m - J.
    From "Quan va nàixer Joan, l'edat de Maria era un terç de l'edat que llavors tenia la mare.":
    J = (M_m - J) / 3

4. **Solving for Joan's age:**
    We know M_m = 2M, substituting this into our equation:
    J = (2M - J) / 3
    3J = 2M - J
    4J = 2M
    2J = M

    This means Maria is twice Joan's age.  Looking at the options, we can deduce that Joan's age must depend on some relationship to Maria's age since this is the only information we can extract.

    If we interpret the question to mean "What is Joan's age in relation to Maria's age?", we would select the option that gives Joan's age in terms of Maria's.
    We have found M=2J so J=M/2, meaning Joan's age is half of Maria's age.

5. **Final Answer:**
    Since we need to determine the relationship between the ages of Joan and Maria, without any numerical values, we analyze the options. The only option that provides such relationship in the given options is option D.

Resposta: D)
