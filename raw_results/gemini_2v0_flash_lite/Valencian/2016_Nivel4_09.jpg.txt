1.  **Define variables**:
    *   V = Vicent's age
    *   D = Dolors' age
    *   R = Rafael's age

2.  **Formulate equations from the given information:**
    *   V + D = 105
    *   D + R = 96
    *   V + R = 117

3.  **Solve the system of equations:**
    *   From the first equation, V = 105 - D
    *   Substitute V in the third equation: (105 - D) + R = 117  =>  R - D = 12
    *   We also have D + R = 96
    *   Adding the equations R - D = 12 and D + R = 96, we get: 2R = 108
    *   Therefore, R = 54
