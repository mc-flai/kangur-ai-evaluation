Raonament: The problem describes cutting a triangle from a square and rearranging it to form a pentagon. The side of the original square is 1 dm. The cut is parallel to a diagonal. The shortest side of the pentagon is formed by the part of the original diagonal, we need to find out the length of this side. If we consider the original square and how the triangle is cut, the cut creates two equal segments on the sides of the original square. When the triangle is moved and placed on the top to create the pentagon, we can calculate the length of the smallest side of the pentagon using the fact that the triangle has the same sides, so the sides can be calculated. The length of the cut is diagonal length, so side of triangle equals to 1 and the base equals to 1, the longest side equals to the square root of 2.
The calculation steps, assume the triangle is created by moving the side equal to $x$, the other side will have the same length $x$. The diagonal of the square is $\sqrt{2}$. The shortest side will be the side on the top.
The length of the smallest side is $\sqrt{2} - x$. We can use the sides of the square. If the side of the square is 1 then the base of the triangle is $1 -x$ and so the triangle is $x^2 + (1-x)^2 = 1$, so $x = \frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2}$. So we can calculate the $x$ as $x = \sqrt{2}-1$. If the side of the square is 1 then the shortest side of the pentagon is $\sqrt{2} -1$.
