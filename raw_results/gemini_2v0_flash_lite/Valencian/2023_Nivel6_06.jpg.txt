Raonament:
The question asks for a condition that applies to any point (x, y) distinct from A and B, that lies on a circle that passes through A(0,0) and B(1,0).
The equation of a circle passing through the points (0,0) and (1,0) has the form
(x-1/2)^2 + y^2 = r^2, where r is the radius of the circle. Since A and B are on the circle, the center of the circle must lie on the line x=1/2.
The given options are:
A) 0 < x < 1. This could be true for the x-coordinate of a point on the circle, but not necessarily all.
B) x = y. Not necessarily.
C) y = 0. This is true only for the points (0,0) and (1,0) which are not valid.
D) y ≠ 0. If the circle passes through A and B, any point on the upper or lower arc of the circle will satisfy y≠0, since the only other possible point on the x-axis would be (1,0).
E) x > y. This is not necessarily true.

Since the points A=(0,0) and B=(1,0) are given, they lie on the x-axis.  The equation of a circle which passes through A and B would have its center on the line x = 1/2.
The only constraint to satisfy for points on a circle through A and B, distinct from A and B, is that y must not equal zero, except for A and B themselves.
