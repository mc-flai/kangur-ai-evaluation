Raonament: The problem asks for the maximum value of the smallest of the nine angles formed in the triangle. To maximize the minimum angle, we should try to make the nine angles as equal as possible. Given the options, let's consider the sum of all angles in the original triangle ABC and how these angles are divided among the new angles. We look for a scenario where we have roughly equal angles. The angles are 1 to 9. Let's assume the angles are such that they are as close as possible to each other. The sum of angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. We want to find the biggest possible value of the smallest angle. The sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. We cannot directly apply a rule to figure this out, we can check by picking each one.
If we assume the smallest angle is 15 degrees: Then let us see how we can arrange that all angles can be at least 15. It does seem that each of them could be 15 or larger by drawing an equilateral triangle, however that is not necessary, 15 does not give a simple split in that case.
If we assume the smallest angle is 24 degrees: It is more likely that the value will be in between, hence we try this.
If we try 30, this seems too high.
Let us make an attempt:
The sum of internal angles of the triangle is 180.
If the smallest angle is x.
Since they form many triangles, this will be a difficult computation.
Looking at the values, we can estimate, and 36 seems high, 15 is low.
We can try to make some calculations:
