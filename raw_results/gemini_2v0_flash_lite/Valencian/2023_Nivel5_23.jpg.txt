Raonament: The problem involves an isosceles triangle with midpoints on its sides. The segments connecting the midpoints to the opposite vertices divide the triangle into smaller triangles and a quadrilateral. We're given the areas of some of these regions. Since M and N are midpoints, the segments AN and MB split the triangle into similar triangles and the triangle at the top has the same area as those at each side. Thus, the area of the missing quadrilateral is 3.
