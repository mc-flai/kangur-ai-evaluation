1. **Identify the areas**: The image contains a square with shaded areas and white areas. The question asks for the ratio of the shaded area to the white area.
2. **Decompose the shapes**: We can see the figure is made of squares and triangles.
3. **Calculate the areas of the squares relative to the biggest square**: We can assume the biggest square has area 1. The big white square inside represents the 1/5 of the area. The area of the medium square represents 1/5 and the small inside square represents 1/5. The rest is shaded, we can see the shaded triangles represent 8/5 of the area and the white triangles 5/5.
4. **Calculate the ratio**: The ratio is therefore 8/5 (shaded area) to 5/5 (white area).
