Raonament: The question asks for the maximum number of cheese pieces (represented by the squares) that can be collected without traversing the same square twice. Essentially, it's asking for the number of squares that can be visited in a path without repetition. We can analyze this like a maze. The number of squares in total is 7x7 = 49. However, since we start and end on the edge of the grid and have some dead ends, we cannot visit all of them. Try different routes without revisiting a square. Since there is an entrance and an exit, we can try to navigate the path. One path would be taking every straight line segment in the grid. The number should be less than 49 because the grid is filled with many obstacles. Upon visual inspection it seems 41 is the best answer.

Resposta: D)
