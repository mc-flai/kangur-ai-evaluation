Raonament: We are given two positive numbers, p and q, with p < q. We need to determine which fraction represents the largest number. We can analyze the fractions by comparing them or by substituting values for p and q, keeping in mind that q must be larger than p. Let's pick p = 1 and q = 2 to see which fraction gives the biggest value.
A) (1 + 3 * 2)/4 = 7/4 = 1.75
B) (1 + 2 * 2)/3 = 5/3 ≈ 1.67
C) (1 + 2)/2 = 3/2 = 1.5
D) (2 * 1 + 2)/3 = 4/3 ≈ 1.33
E) (3 * 1 + 2)/4 = 5/4 = 1.25
The largest value is A. Let's also pick another example.
p = 2 and q = 3.
A) (2 + 3 * 3)/4 = 11/4 = 2.75
B) (2 + 2 * 3)/3 = 8/3 ≈ 2.67
C) (2 + 3)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5
D) (2 * 2 + 3)/3 = 7/3 ≈ 2.33
E) (3 * 2 + 3)/4 = 9/4 = 2.25
Again, A is the biggest number. In general the larger the ratio of q to p and the larger the coefficient with q the larger the overall value of the fraction is, since q > p.

Resposta: A)
