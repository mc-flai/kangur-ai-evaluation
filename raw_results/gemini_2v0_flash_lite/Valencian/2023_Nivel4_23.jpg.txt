The numbers are such that 1, 3, 13, 31, 131 are "cangurils".
We need to decompose 1362 into a sum of these numbers, minimizing the number of summands.
The largest "canguril" less than 1362 is 131. We can use the following method:
*   Divide 1362 by 131: 1362 = 10 * 131 + 52
*   Now we consider 52. The largest canguril <= 52 is 31. 52 = 1 * 31 + 21
*   Now we consider 21. The largest canguril <= 21 is 13. 21 = 1 * 13 + 8
*   Now we consider 8. The largest canguril <= 8 is 3. 8 = 2 * 3 + 2
*   Now we consider 2. The largest canguril <= 2 is 1. 2 = 2 * 1 + 0
Thus 1362 = 10 * 131 + 1 * 31 + 1 * 13 + 2 * 3 + 2 * 1.
This means 1362 = 10(131) + 1(31) + 1(13) + 2(3) + 2(1).
The sum of the coefficients is 10 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 16.
The minimal quantity of summands is 16.
