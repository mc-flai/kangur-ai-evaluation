Raonament: The question asks about the number of polygonal lines with vertices A and E, passing through the other points B, C, and D, that divide the square into two equal areas. There are three such lines: A-B-C-E, A-B-D-E, A-C-D-E. Note that the area of the square is 12 (each small square is 1), then we need a line dividing the square into areas of 6.
