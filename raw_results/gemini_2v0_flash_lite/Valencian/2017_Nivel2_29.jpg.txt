Raonament:
1. **Calculate speeds:** Dani takes 12 minutes, so his speed is 1/12 (fraction of the distance per minute). Aitana takes 16 minutes, so her speed is 1/16.
2. **Aitana's head start:** Aitana starts 1 minute earlier. In that minute, she covers 1/16 of the distance.
3. **Relative speed:** Dani gains on Aitana at a rate of (1/12) - (1/16) = 4/48 - 3/48 = 1/48 (fraction of the distance per minute).
4. **Time to catch up:**  Dani needs to cover the 1/16 distance Aitana has already covered. The time to catch up is the distance divided by the relative speed: (1/16) / (1/48) = (1/16) * 48 = 3 minutes.
