1. **Define variables:**
   *  Let 'x' be the total training time.
   *  Warm-up time = x/3
   *  Match time = (x/3) + 12
   *  Service practice time = 20 minutes

2.  **Set up the equation:** The total training time is the sum of the three parts:
   x = x/3 + (x/3 + 12) + 20

3. **Solve for x:**
   * x = x/3 + x/3 + 12 + 20
   * x = (2x/3) + 32
   * x - (2x/3) = 32
   * x/3 = 32
   * x = 96
