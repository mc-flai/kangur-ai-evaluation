Raonament: The last digit of powers of 4 follows a pattern: 4^1 = 4, 4^2 = 16 (last digit 6), 4^3 = 64 (last digit 4), 4^4 = 256 (last digit 6), and so on. The last digit alternates between 4 and 6. Specifically, if the exponent is odd, the last digit is 4, and if the exponent is even, the last digit is 6. Since 2015 is an odd number, the last digit of 4^2015 must be 4.
