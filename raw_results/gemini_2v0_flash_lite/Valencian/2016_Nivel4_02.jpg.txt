1. **Joan:** Let 'b' be the number of brothers Joan has and 'g' be the number of sisters Joan has. The problem states that Joan has the same number of brothers as sisters, so b = g.
2. **Anna:** Anna is Joan's sister. She has b brothers (the same as Joan) and g-1 sisters (because Anna is one of the sisters, but Joan is not). The problem states that Anna has twice as many brothers as sisters: b = 2 * (g-1).
3. **Solve the equations:**
    *  Substitute 'b' with 'g' in the second equation: g = 2 * (g-1).
    *  Solve for g: g = 2g - 2 => g = 2.
    *  Since b = g, then b = 2.
4. **Total Children:**  There are 2 brothers + 2 sisters + 1 sister (Anna) + 1 brother (Joan) = 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7 children.
