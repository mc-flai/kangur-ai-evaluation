Let's denote the amount of money each person has as follows:
Alba = A
Bernat = B
Cris = C
David = D

We are given:
A + B = 5
C + D = 6
A + C = 7
We want to find B + D.

From A + B = 5, we have A = 5 - B.
Substituting this into A + C = 7, we get (5 - B) + C = 7, which means C - B = 2, or C = B + 2.
Substituting C = B + 2 into C + D = 6, we get (B + 2) + D = 6, which simplifies to B + D = 4.
