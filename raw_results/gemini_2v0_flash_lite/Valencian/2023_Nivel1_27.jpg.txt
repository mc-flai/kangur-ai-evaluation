Let's denote the capacity of each barrel as 'x'.
Initially, the first barrel is empty and the second barrel is full. After transferring 50 liters from the second barrel to the first, the first barrel has 50 liters, and the second barrel has x - 50 liters.
According to the problem, the first barrel then has 25% more water than the second. This means the first barrel contains 1.25 times the amount of water in the second barrel.  So, 50 = 1.25 * (x - 50).
Now solve for x:
50 = 1.25x - 62.5
50 + 62.5 = 1.25x
112.5 = 1.25x
x = 112.5 / 1.25
x = 90

The initial amount of water in the second barrel is 90 liters. After transferring 50 liters, the first barrel has 50 liters and the second barrel has 90-50 = 40 liters. 50 is 1.25 times 40.
Therefore, the capacity of each barrel is 90 liters.
