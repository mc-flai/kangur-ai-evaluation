Raonament: The problem states that the top cell must be 720, and each cell's value is the product of the two cells below it.  Let the values of the middle row (from left to right) be x and y, and let the values of the bottom row (from left to right) be a, n, and b.  Then we have:  x * y = 720, a * n = x, and n * b = y. Combining these equations gives (an)*(nb) = xy = 720, which simplifies to ab*n^2 = 720. We need to find how many possible integer values can n be, and n must also be a positive integer. This means n^2 must be a factor of 720. We need to find the prime factorization of 720 to easily find all factors. 720 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5.  Thus n^2 must be a perfect square that divides 720. Possible values for n^2 are 1, 4, 9, and 36.  So the possible values of n are the square roots of these: 1, 2, 3, and 6. Therefore, there are 4 different values.
