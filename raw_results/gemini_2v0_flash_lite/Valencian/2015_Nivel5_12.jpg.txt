Raonament:
1.  **Define Variables:**
    *   Let 'p' be the price of a kilo of apples.
    *   Let 'b' be the price of a kilo of bananas.
    *   Let 'x' be the amount Anna spends on Monday.

2.  **Formulate Equations from Monday's Purchase:**
    *   Anna buys apples and bananas (let's assume she bought 'a' kilos of apples and 'c' kilos of bananas on Monday).
    *   x = a\*p + c\*b

3.  **Formulate Equation from Tuesday's Purchase:**
    *   Anna buys 0.5 kilos less apples and 1 kilo more bananas.
    *   The spending amount is the same.
    *   x = (a - 0.5)\*p + (c + 1)\*b

4.  **Equate the Expressions for x:**
    *   a\*p + c\*b = (a - 0.5)\*p + (c + 1)\*b

5.  **Simplify the Equation:**
    *   a\*p + c\*b = a\*p - 0.5\*p + c\*b + b
    *   0 = -0.5\*p + b
    *   0.5\*p = b
    *   p = 2\*b

6.  **Interpret the Result:**
    *   The equation p = 2\*b means that the price of one kilo of apples is twice the price of one kilo of bananas.
    *   Therefore, two kilos of bananas cost the same as one kilo of apples, which is not any of the options.
    *   Alternatively, one kilo of apples costs the same as two kilos of bananas.

7.  **Consider other options**
    *   Two kilos of apples cost the same as four kilos of bananas.
    *   From p=2b
    *   2p = 4b
    *   Option A states that two kilos of apples (2p) cost the same as three kilos of bananas. This is incorrect.
    *   Option B states that two kilos of bananas (2b), which costs one kilo of apples, cost the same as three kilos of apples. This is incorrect.
    *   Option C states that one kilo of apples costs half of one kilo of bananas. That is also incorrect.
    *   Option D states that one kilo of bananas costs half of one kilo of apples. The equation p=2b indicates it's the opposite.
    *   Option E states that nothing can be said.

8. **Looking back at the derivation**
    *   The relationship between the apple and banana price is that 1 kilo of apples = 2 kilos of bananas.
    *   Multiplying both sides by 3/2 (for example), 3/2 kilo of apples = 3 kilos of bananas.
    *   So the equation above is incorrect. The calculations need to be rechecked.
9. **Rechecking the calculation:**
    *   a\*p + c\*b = (a - 0.5)\*p + (c + 1)\*b
    *   a\*p + c\*b = a\*p - 0.5\*p + c\*b + b
    *   0 = -0.5p + b
    *   b = 0.5p
    *   2b = p
    *   1 kilo of apples = 2 kilos of bananas.
    *   Option A, two kilos of apples, costs 2p, is not equal to three kilos of bananas (3 * 0.5p = 1.5 p).
    *   Option B, two kilos of bananas (2 * 0.5p = 1p) which is equal to one kilo of apples (1p), costs the same as three kilos of apples, is incorrect.
    *   Option C: One kilo of apples (p) is twice the cost of one kilo of banana (0.5p), is incorrect.
    *   Option D: One kilo of bananas (0.5p) is half of one kilo of apples (p), correct.
