1. **Understanding the Problem:** The problem involves an equilateral triangle from which three smaller equilateral triangles are cut off at the vertices, forming a hexagon. We are given the perimeter of the large triangle (60 cm) and the hexagon (40 cm), and we need to find the sum of the perimeters of the small triangles.
2. **Relating Perimeters:** Each side of the large triangle contributes to two sides of the hexagon and one side of a small triangle. Therefore, the sum of perimeters of the small triangles is equal to the perimeter of the big triangle minus the perimeter of the hexagon.
3. **Calculation:** The perimeter of the three small triangles is given by (perimeter of big triangle) - (perimeter of hexagon) = (60 cm) - (40 cm) = 20 cm. However, this does not include the sides of the small triangles which form part of the perimeter of the big triangle. Since each side of the large triangle is made up of sides of the hexagon and two sides of small triangles, the big triangle perimeter is 60cm, and the hexagon is 40cm, so the big triangle has sides that equal to 20cm (60/3 = 20), and this is also the perimeter of the small triangles. There are three sides on each triangle, so the sides of the small triangles must be 60cm - 40cm = 20cm * 3 = 60cm.
4. **Final Answer:** The sum of the perimeters of the three smaller triangles equals 60 cm.
