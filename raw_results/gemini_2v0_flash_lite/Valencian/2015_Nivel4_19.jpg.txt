Raonament:
The problem states that `CD/CA = 1/3` and `AE/AB = 1/3`.
The area of triangle `ADE` can be calculated using the formula `0.5 * AE * AD * sin(A)`.
The area of triangle `ABC` can be calculated using the formula `0.5 * AB * AC * sin(A)`.
Since `AD/AC = 1 - CD/CA = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3`.
Then:
Area(ADE) / Area(ABC) = (0.5 * AE * AD * sin(A)) / (0.5 * AB * AC * sin(A)) = (AE/AB) * (AD/AC) = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9.
