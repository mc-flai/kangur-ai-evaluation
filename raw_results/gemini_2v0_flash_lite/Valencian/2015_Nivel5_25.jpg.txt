Raonament: The problem is about the number of squares crossed by the diagonal of a rectangle. When the dimensions of the rectangle are relatively prime, the number of squares crossed is the sum of the dimensions minus 1. However, in this case, we are given a rectangle of dimensions 36 and 25. Since 36 and 25 do not share a common factor, then the number of squares crossed is 36+25-1=60.
