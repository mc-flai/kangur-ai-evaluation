Raonament: This is a classic problem related to the Frobenius coin problem (also known as the coin problem or the money changing problem).  When you have only two denominations (6 and 7 in this case), there's a simple formula to find the largest amount that cannot be formed:  g(a, b) = ab - a - b, where 'a' and 'b' are the denominations. In this case, a=6 and b=7.  So g(6, 7) = (6 * 7) - 6 - 7 = 42 - 6 - 7 = 29.

Resposta: B)
