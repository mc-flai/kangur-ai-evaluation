Raonament: The question asks for the maximum total amount of money 11 tourists can have, given that each has an odd number of euros, no two have the same amount, and the maximum amount for any tourist is 25 euros. To maximize the total, we should assign the highest possible odd numbers to each tourist. The largest 11 odd numbers less than or equal to 25 are: 25, 23, 21, 19, 17, 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5. The sum is 25 + 23 + 21 + 19 + 17 + 15 + 13 + 11 + 9 + 7 + 5 = 165.
