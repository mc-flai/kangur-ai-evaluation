Raonament: We have a right triangle ABC, where AB = 60 cm, BC = 80 cm, and AC = 100 cm.  BD is perpendicular to AC. We need to find the length of AD.
Since triangle ABC is a right triangle, we can calculate the area in two ways:
1. Using the legs:  Area = (1/2) * AB * BC = (1/2) * 60 * 80 = 2400 cm^2
2. Using the hypotenuse and the height BD: Area = (1/2) * AC * BD = (1/2) * 100 * BD
Equating the two area expressions gives us: (1/2) * 100 * BD = 2400 => BD = 48 cm
Now, in the right triangle ABD:
AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2
60^2 = AD^2 + 48^2
3600 = AD^2 + 2304
AD^2 = 3600 - 2304
AD^2 = 1296
AD = sqrt(1296) = 36 cm
