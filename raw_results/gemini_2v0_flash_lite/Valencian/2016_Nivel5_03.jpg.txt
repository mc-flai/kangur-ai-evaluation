Raonament: The problem asks to find the result of the expression $\sqrt{\sqrt{x}}$. We can rewrite the expression as $(x^{\frac{1}{2}})^{\frac{1}{2}}$. Using the rule of exponents, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$, this becomes $x^{\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = x^{\frac{1}{4}}$.  The radical form for $x^{\frac{1}{4}}$ is $\sqrt[4]{x}$. However, since the question is asking for the equivalent of $\sqrt{\sqrt{x}}$, we convert both square roots into a single one by multiplying the exponents. $\sqrt{\sqrt{x}} = x^{\frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2}} = x^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{x}$, none of the options are $\sqrt[4]{x}$, which is the correct answer. Let's rewrite the problem and then solve it: $\sqrt{\sqrt{x}}$ is the same as $\sqrt[2]{\sqrt[2]{x}}$. Thus, we multiply the exponents, which gives us $\sqrt[2*2]{x}$, or $\sqrt[4]{x}$. Looking at the choices and recognizing the double square root as the fourth root. Option C has 8 in the radical, so this is not the correct answer.

Response: C)
