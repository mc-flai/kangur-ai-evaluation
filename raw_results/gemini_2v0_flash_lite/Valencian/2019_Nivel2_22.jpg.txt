Raonament: Let's analyze how the divisibility by 3 changes with each operation.

*   **+1**: If a number is divisible by 3, adding 1 will result in a number that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. If a number is not divisible by 3, adding 1 can result in a divisible number (e.g., 2+1=3).
*   **+1**: Applying +1 again, we have similar considerations to the previous step.
*   **x3**: Multiplying by 3 ensures the resulting number will be divisible by 3, regardless of the previous number's divisibility.
*   **+2**: Adding 2 to a multiple of 3 will leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3.
*   **x2**: Multiplying by 2. A number leaving a remainder of 2 when divided by 3 multiplied by 2 will leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 (since 2x2 = 4 leaves remainder 1).

Now, let's consider some initial numbers:

*   **Initial number divisible by 3**: The sequence will be: div by 3, not div by 3, not div by 3, div by 3, not div by 3, not div by 3. Two numbers will be divisible by 3.
*   **Initial number leaving remainder 1 when divided by 3**: The sequence will be: not div by 3, not div by 3, div by 3, not div by 3, not div by 3, not div by 3. One number will be divisible by 3.
*   **Initial number leaving remainder 2 when divided by 3**: The sequence will be: not div by 3, not div by 3, div by 3, not div by 3, not div by 3, not div by 3. One number will be divisible by 3.

Therefore, the number of divisible numbers will be either one or two.
