Raonament:
1.  **Identify the pattern:** The image shows a partially constructed triangle made up of smaller triangles. To form a complete triangle, we need to fill the missing spaces.
2.  **Count the missing triangles:** The existing figure resembles a triangle. The missing section is a triangle that would fit at the bottom.  Counting the rows, we see the current figure would need to expand to have 4 rows of the small triangles. The largest triangle needs to contain 4x4 = 16 small triangles.
3. **Calculate the number of triangles to add**: We can see that there are 7 small triangles already drawn.  Therefore, 16-7= 9 more small triangles need to be added to complete a large triangle.
