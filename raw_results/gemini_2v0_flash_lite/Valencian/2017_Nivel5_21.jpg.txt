Raonament: For each person, after 10 laps, they will have jumped a number of times corresponding to a multiple of 400m (the total length of the circuit). The hole is 75cm long, and the person who doesn't fall into it will have a jump length that is not a multiple of 75.
- Carles: 70 cm. 70 is not divisible by 75.
- Berta: 80 cm. 80 is not divisible by 75.
- Albert: 85 cm. 85 is not divisible by 75.
- Esther: 90 cm. 90 is divisible by 75 (90 = 75 x 1.2).
- David: 95 cm. 95 is not divisible by 75.
Only the person whose jump length is not a multiple of 75 can avoid the hole.
