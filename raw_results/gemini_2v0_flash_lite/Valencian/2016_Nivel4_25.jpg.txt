Raonament:  The small square is rotated so that its vertices touch the sides of the larger square.  The side of the large square is 7cm, and the side of the small square is 5cm. When the small square is rotated and its corners touch the larger square, the vertices of the small square divide each side of the large square into two segments. By symmetry, both segments are the same length for each side.  One segment will have length (7 - 5)/2 = 1 cm and the other segment will have length (7+5)/2 = 3cm. Thus, the ratio is 3:4.
