Raonament: The question asks how many two-digit positive integers are equal to 4 times the sum of their digits. Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where a and b are digits from 0 to 9, and a is not 0 (since it's a two-digit number). The question states that 10a + b = 4(a + b). Simplifying the equation: 10a + b = 4a + 4b. Further simplification yields: 6a = 3b, or 2a = b. Now we need to find the pairs of digits (a, b) that fulfill this equation, where a can be between 1 and 9, and b can be between 0 and 9. If a = 1, then b = 2. The number is 12, and 4*(1+2) = 12. If a = 2, then b = 4. The number is 24, and 4*(2+4) = 24. If a = 3, then b = 6. The number is 36, and 4*(3+6) = 36. If a = 4, then b = 8. The number is 48, and 4*(4+8) = 48. If a is greater than 4, then b is greater than 9, which is not possible for a single digit. So the numbers are 12, 24, 36, and 48. There are 4 such numbers.
