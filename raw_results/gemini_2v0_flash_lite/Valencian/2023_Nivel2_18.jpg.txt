Raonament:
Let the five numbers be a, b, c, d, and e.
We are given:
1. a + b + c = 100
2. b + c + d = 200
3. c + d + e = 300
We want to find the value of c.
From (1), c = 100 - a - b
From (2), c = 200 - b - d
From (3), c = 300 - d - e
We can also derive the equations:
(1) - (2) => a - d = -100 => a = d - 100
(3) - (2) => e - b = 100 => e = b + 100
Add (1), (2), and (3):
(a+b+c) + (b+c+d) + (c+d+e) = 100 + 200 + 300
a + 2b + 3c + 2d + e = 600
Substitute a=d-100 and e=b+100:
(d-100) + 2b + 3c + 2d + (b+100) = 600
3b + 3d + 3c = 600
3(b+c+d) = 600
b + c + d = 200
We already know from (2) that b+c+d = 200, so this doesn't help us much.

From (1) a+b+c=100, and (2) b+c+d=200, so d - a = 100.  Also from (3), c+d+e=300.
(1) - (2): a - d = -100 => a = d - 100.
(3) - (2): e - b = 100 => e = b + 100.
Add 1 and 3: a+b+c+c+d+e = 100 + 300 = 400
Substitute b+c+d = 200:
(a + e) + (b + c + d) = 400
a + e = 200
(d - 100) + (b + 100) = 200
d + b = 200
b + c + d = 200 (from equation 2).
c = 200 - (b + d)
Since b+d=200, then c=200-200=0 which is not possible since we can have only positive integers.

Add (1) and (3)
a + b + c + c + d + e = 400
(b + c + d) + a + c + e = 400
200 + a + c + e = 400
a + c + e = 200
From (1) a + b + c = 100 => a + c = 100 - b
From (3) c + d + e = 300 => c + e = 300 - d
So: a+c+e = 200
100 - b + e = 200
e = 100 + b
300 - d + a = 200
a = d - 100

a + b + c = 100
b + c + d = 200
c + d + e = 300

c = 200 - b - d
So substitute c = 200 - b - d into b + c + d = 200, which doesn't help.

c = (100+300-200)/2 = 100
So from this, c=100. b+c+d=200 implies b+d=100. a+b+100 = 100 means a+b = 0 which is not possible.
a + b + c = 100
b + c + d = 200
c + d + e = 300
Adding first and third: a + b + 2c + d + e = 400.
Subtracting the second: a + b + 2c + d + e - (b + c + d) = 400 - 200
a + c + e = 200
Then 2*c = (100 + 300) - 200 = 200 => c = 100.
