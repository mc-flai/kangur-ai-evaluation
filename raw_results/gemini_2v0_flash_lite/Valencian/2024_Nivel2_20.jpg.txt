Raonament:
1. **Identify the shapes:** The figure is composed of a large square, four smaller black squares, and four grey triangles.
2. **Find the area of the large square:** The area of the large square is given as 16 cm².
3. **Find the area of the black squares:** The area of each small black square is given as 1 cm². There are four such squares, so their combined area is 4 cm².
4. **Deduce the area of the white and grey shapes:**  The area of the white part of the square plus the area of the grey parts can be found by subtracting the area of the four black squares from the area of the big square: 16 cm² - 4 cm² = 12 cm².
5. **Find the area of the triangles:** The triangles appear to form a complete set to occupy half of the area of the square.
6. **Determine the area of the grey parts:** The grey area is made up of 4 triangles. The four triangles appears to form a 2 squares within the figure. Half of the area of the big square is made up of the four grey triangles. Therefore, the grey area will be half of the 12 cm² which are formed by the triangles: 12 cm² / 2 = 6 cm².
