Raonament: The equation is x² - y² = 105.  We can factor the left side as a difference of squares: (x - y)(x + y) = 105.  Since x and y are positive integers, x + y must be positive. Thus, x - y must also be positive. We need to find pairs of factors of 105.  The factors of 105 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, and 105.  We can set up the following systems of equations:

*   x - y = 1, x + y = 105. Adding the equations gives 2x = 106, so x = 53. Then y = 105 - 53 = 52. (53, 52) is a valid solution.
*   x - y = 3, x + y = 35. Adding the equations gives 2x = 38, so x = 19. Then y = 35 - 19 = 16. (19, 16) is a valid solution.
*   x - y = 5, x + y = 21. Adding the equations gives 2x = 26, so x = 13. Then y = 21 - 13 = 8. (13, 8) is a valid solution.
*   x - y = 7, x + y = 15. Adding the equations gives 2x = 22, so x = 11. Then y = 15 - 11 = 4. (11, 4) is a valid solution.

There are 4 pairs of positive integers.
