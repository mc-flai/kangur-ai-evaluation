Raonament:
1.  **Identify multiples of 3:** We are looking for two-digit numbers that are divisible by 3.
2.  **Difference of digits is 3:** The absolute difference between the digits of the two-digit number must be 3.
3.  **List possible numbers:**
    *   1-digit difference: 1+3 = 4. Two-digit multiples of 3 with difference 3 are 14 is not a multiple of 3.
    *   Multiples of 3 are 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99.
        *   1+4=5. Numbers that satisfy the conditions: 30, 69, 96.
        *   Difference of 3.
        *   69. 9-6=3. 6+9=15. The sum is a multiple of 3
        *   96. 9-6=3. 9+6=15. The sum is a multiple of 3.
        *   1 + 4 is not a multiple of 3
        *   2 + 5 is not a multiple of 3
        *   3 + 6 = 9. 6-3 =3. 36 is divisible by 3 and the difference is 3.
        *   4 + 7 is not a multiple of 3
        *   5 + 8 is not a multiple of 3
        *   6 + 9 = 15. 9-6=3. 69 and 96
        *   7 + 4 is not a multiple of 3
        *   8 + 5 is not a multiple of 3
        *   9 + 6 = 15

4.  **Count valid numbers:** The valid numbers are 36, 69 and 96. Thus, there are 3 numbers.
