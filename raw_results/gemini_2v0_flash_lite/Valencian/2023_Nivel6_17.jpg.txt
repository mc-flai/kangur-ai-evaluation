1. **Visualize the problem:** Imagine unwrapping the cylinder. The thread would then trace the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.
2. **Identify triangle sides:** One side is the height of the cylinder (4 m). The other side is the circumference of the cylinder, calculated as 2 * pi * radius = 2 * pi * 1 = 2 * pi m.
3. **Apply Pythagorean theorem:** The length of the thread (hypotenuse) is calculated by the formula a^2 + b^2 = c^2 where c is the hypotenuse.  In this case: length = sqrt(4^2 + (2*pi)^2) = sqrt(16 + 4*pi^2) = sqrt(4*(4+pi^2))= 2*sqrt(pi^2+4)
