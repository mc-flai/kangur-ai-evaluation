Raonament:
Let's denote the number of cubes as 'c' and the number of tetrahedra as 't'.
A cube has 8 vertices and 6 faces.
A tetrahedron has 4 vertices and 4 faces.
We can form two equations based on the information given:
1.  Vertices: 8c + 4t = 52
2.  Faces: 6c + 4t = 42

Now, let's solve the equations.
Subtract the second equation from the first equation:
(8c + 4t) - (6c + 4t) = 52 - 42
2c = 10
c = 5

Substitute c = 5 into the second equation:
6 * 5 + 4t = 42
30 + 4t = 42
4t = 12
t = 3

The question asks for the number of tetrahedra, which is t.

Resposta: B)
