The question states: "We choose a number, subtract 215, add 2015 to the result and we obtain 20015. What is the chosen number?".
Let's represent the chosen number as 'x'. The equation will be:
x - 215 + 2015 = 20015
Simplifying:
x + 1800 = 20015
x = 20015 - 1800
x = 18215
Therefore, the number chosen is 18215.
