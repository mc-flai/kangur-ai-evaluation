Raonament: The question asks for the number of ways to form a rectangle with 30 square tables, with an empty center. The area is 30. We need to find the factors of 30, as these represent the possible dimensions (length and width) of the rectangle. The factors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.  However, we are considering rectangles, so we can have dimensions:
1x30
2x15
3x10
5x6
These are the possible shapes.  Since we are asked for the number of ways to form the rectangle, each of these 4 dimension pairs represents a unique way.

Resposta: D)
