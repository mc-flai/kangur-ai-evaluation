Raonament:
1.  **Initial state:** The large cube is made of 64 smaller cubes (4x4x4). One cube is black, the rest are white.
2.  **Day 1:** The black cube changes the color of its neighbors (cubes sharing a face with it) to black. From the image, we see that the black cube is located at the top corner. It has 3 neighbors. So, initially, we have 1 black cube + 3 newly black cubes.
3.  **Day 2:** All the black cubes change the color of their neighbors to black. The initial black cube (located in a corner) has 3 neighbors that have changed to black.  Each of these 3 black cubes will change the color of 4 other cubes. 
    *   Initially, we have 1 black cube + 3 changed cubes = 4 black cubes.
    *   The central black cube has 3 neighbors (which are already black).
    *   Each of the 3 cubes that are black will turn 4 neighbours. They all share 2 neighbours with each other and also the initial black cube, so each will affect two other cubes that are not neighbours of other. This changes the colors of 3x2 = 6 white cubes to black.
    *   We have 1 + 3 + 6 + 3(Initial Black cube).
    *   Total black cubes are 1+3+6 = 16.
