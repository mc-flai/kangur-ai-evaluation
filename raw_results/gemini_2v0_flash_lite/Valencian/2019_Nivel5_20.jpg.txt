Raonament:
Since the four triangles CFB, FCE, FED and EDA have equal areas, and they all share the same height relative to the base AB, then their bases must be proportional to their areas. Therefore, BF = FC = FD = DA. Let BF = x. Then, BD = BF + FD = 2x and AF = AD + DF = 2x. Therefore, AF/DB = (2x) / x = 7/6.
