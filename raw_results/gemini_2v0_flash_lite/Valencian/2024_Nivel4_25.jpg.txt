Raonament: The problem states that the number inside each square is the product of the numbers in the four vertices.  We need to find the numbers in the grey circles first.
1.  **Top square:** The vertices are the two top grey circles and the two white circles. Let the top grey circles have the values *x* and *y*, and the top white circles have the values *a* and *b*. Then *x* * a* * b* * y* = 10.
2.  **Left square:** The vertices are a grey circle, *a*, and two white circles. Let the white circles have the values *c*. This means the two white circles are the same. Then, *x* * a* * c* * c* = 4.
3.  **Middle square:** The vertices are *a*, *b* and two white circles. Then, *a* * b* * c* * d* = 12.
4.  **Right square:** Then, *b* * y* * d* * d* = 6.
5.  **Bottom square:** Let the bottom grey circles have the value *z*, and let the white circles have the value *d* again. Then, *z* * z* * c* * d* = 24.
We can observe the equations and begin from the bottom.  From *z* * z* * c* * d* = 24, *c* and *d* are not 0. From the other squares, we can find *c* = 2, *d* = 3.
Then, the product of all the grey circles is *x* \* *y* \* *z* \* *z* = 1 * 5 * 2 * 2 = 20. The *c* and *d* can be substituted into the equations. Then find *a* =1, *b* = 2, *x* = 1, *y* = 5, *z* = 2.
The product of the grey circles is: 1 \* 5 \* 2 \* 2 \* 1 \* 3 \* 3 \* 2 = 120.
