Raonament: The question describes a combination lock that has been rotated. We are looking for the option that, when rotated, cannot result in the combination 6348.  I will analyze each option to see if it can become 6348 after rotating the wheels:
*   **A) 8560**: If we rotate the wheels one position forward, we will get 5608. This is not 6348.
*   **B) 3015**: If we rotate the wheels three positions forward, we will get 6348.
*   **C) 4906**: If we rotate the wheels three positions forward, we will get 6348.
*   **D) 1893**: If we rotate the wheels three positions forward, we will get 6348.
*   **E) 0782**: If we rotate the wheels two positions forward, we will get 6348.

The only combination that cannot result in 6348 is A.

Resposta: A)
