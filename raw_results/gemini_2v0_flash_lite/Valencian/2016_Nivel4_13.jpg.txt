The question asks which of the given numbers cannot be expressed as the product of a prime number and two composite numbers. Let's examine each option:
A) 2^5 = 32. We need to determine if we can express it as p * c1 * c2 where p is prime and c1 and c2 are composite. 32 can be written as 2 * 4 * 4, where 2 is prime and 4, 4 are composite.
B) 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.  We can write 120 = 3 * 4 * 10 (3 is prime, and 4 and 10 are composite).
C) 2 * 3^2 * 5 = 90.  The prime factorization is 2 * 3 * 3 * 5. We try expressing it as p * c1 * c2.  90 = 2 * 9 * 5. It seems impossible to write 90 as the product of a prime and two composite number.
D) 6 * 12 = 72. 72 = 2 * 36. 2 is prime, 36 is composite. But, if we express 72 as a product of one prime and two composite numbers, we can have for example, 3 * 4 * 6.
E) 1000 = 2^3 * 5^3. 1000 = 5 * 8 * 25 (5 is prime, 8 is composite, 25 is composite). Or 2* 50*10.

Therefore, the number that cannot be written is 90.

Resposta: C)
