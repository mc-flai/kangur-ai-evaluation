Raonament:
Let's denote the original price of the computer as 'x'.
In shop A, Marta gets a 15% discount, so the price becomes 0.85x. Then she gets another discount of 90 euros, so the final price in shop A is 0.85x - 90.
In shop B, Marta gets a 25% discount, so the price becomes 0.75x.
Marta saves 15 euros by buying in shop A, so the price in shop A is 15 euros less than in shop B:
0.85x - 90 = 0.75x - 15
0.1x = 75
x = 750
So, the original price is 750 euros.
The price in A is 0.85 * 750 - 90 = 637.5 - 90 = 547.5 euros.
The price in B is 0.75 * 750 = 562.5 euros
Since the price of computer is requested, not the discount or final price, we give the original price.
