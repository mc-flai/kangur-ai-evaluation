Raonament: The area of the white part is equal to the area of the smaller square minus the area of the intersection with the larger square. The smaller square has sides of 5 cm, so its area is 5 cm * 5 cm = 25 cm². The part of the small square intersecting the larger square forms a triangle. The small square has one vertex in the center of the larger square. The area of this intersecting white triangle is 1/4 of the area of the small square which has area 25 cm² * 1/4 = 6.25 cm².  The white area is the area of the small square minus the intersecting area, so it's the area of the small square minus the gray triangle. The white area appears to be made by taking a square and removing an area which is a 1/4 of the small square plus a triangle whose base is 1 and height is 6. Let's find the triangle area.
Area of the triangle where one edge is shared with the big square = 0.5 * base * height = 0.5 * 1 cm * 6 cm = 3 cm². The big square edge is 6 cm. Then the area of the small square is 5 cm * 5 cm = 25 cm². 
Let's find the area of the shared white part, which is the area of the triangle inside the big square. The big square is being cut by the small square. The area of the small square is 25 cm². Then, one of the vertices of the small square is on the center of the big square. Then, let's consider the intersection of the two squares.  The white area would then be the area of the small square minus the area of the intersection, but the problem describes it as the white area. Then it seems that the intersecting area is 1/4 of the small square. The white part is made of the remaining area of the small square after removing the gray part.
Let's calculate the area of the small square = 5 cm * 5 cm = 25 cm². The grey area consists of the triangle that is adjacent to the white area. The gray area = (1/2) * (5) * (1)= 2.5 cm^2.
If we calculate the white area as the area of the small square minus the intersecting area we would have 25 - 6.25= 18.75 which is wrong. It looks like one edge is one cm, since the big square side is 6. The white part would then be the area of the small square minus the intersection area, being the intersection area (1/2) * (1) * (5) = 2.5. The side of the small square minus the gray triangle is 25 - 16 = 9. The white area can be approximated as 1/4 * (6 cm * 6 cm) = 9 cm².
