Raonament:
The question states that the sum a + a + a + b + b + b + b is equal to the two digit number ab. This means that 3a + 4b = 10a + b. Simplifying, we have 3a + 4b = 10a + b, or 3b = 7a. Since a and b are digits, the only possible solution for 3b = 7a is a=3 and b=7. This is because a and b must be integers between 0 and 9.
The question asks what is the value of a + b. Therefore, a + b = 3 + 7 = 10.
