Raonament:
1. **Maria's position:** Maria finished 16th.
2. **Girls between Lluïsa and Maria:** There are 12 girls between Lluïsa and Maria.
3. **Girls between Lluïsa and Carla vs. Carla and Maria:** There are 3 more girls between Lluïsa and Carla than between Carla and Maria.  Let's denote the number of girls between Carla and Maria as x. Then the number of girls between Lluïsa and Carla is x + 3.
4. **Total girls between Lluïsa and Maria:** The girls between Lluïsa and Maria can be expressed in terms of x as the number between Lluïsa and Carla (x + 3), plus the number between Carla and Maria (x). So (x + 3) + x = 12.
5. **Solve for x:**  2x + 3 = 12 => 2x = 9 => x = 4.5. But we are talking about number of girls so there must be a mistake. Let's correct and suppose that "Hi ha 3 xiquetes més entre Lluïsa i Carla que les que hi ha entre Carla i Maria" means that the number of girls between Lluisa and Carla is x+3 and the number of girls between Carla and Maria is x. Then (x+3)+x = 12 girls between Lluisa and Maria (as stated). But now Maria is in the 16th position. so we can arrange the women:
*   Lluisa - (x+3) - Carla - x - Maria
*   Maria is 16th, so Lluisa must be before her. Therefore x + 1 + x + 1 + 1 = 12 so 2x = 9. Still does not work properly.
Let's re-interpret the statement and see if there is other way to write it: if there is x girls between Carla and Maria and x+3 between Lluisa and Carla, and 12 girls between Lluisa and Maria, then x + x + 3 = 12 => 2x = 9. Does not make sense, the most probable is that Carla is before Maria and Lluisa. So the correct arrangement is: Lluisa - (x+3) - Carla - (x) - Maria. Then,
 girls between Lluisa and Carla are x+3, Carla is after those girls. and then the girls between Carla and Maria are x. So, Lluisa is before Carla, and Carla is before Maria. The number of girls between Lluisa and Maria is 12.
x+3 + x = 12. 2x = 9 => x = 4.5 (does not make sense)
Let's assume Lluisa is before Carla and Carla before Maria:
Girls between Carla and Maria = x
Girls between Lluisa and Carla = x + 3
Girls between Lluisa and Maria = 12
x + (x + 3) = 12 => 2x = 9, still does not work with integer numbers. Let's recheck the original statement.
"Hi ha 3 xiquetes més entre Lluïsa i Carla que les que hi ha entre Carla i Maria". The number of girls between Lluïsa and Maria is 12, Maria is 16th. If Carla is behind Lluisa. We have:
Lluisa - x+3- Carla - x - Maria
If x is the number of girls between Carla and Maria, and x+3 girls between Lluisa and Carla, and the total number of girls between Lluisa and Maria is 12:
(x+3) + 1 + x +1 = 12+2; this means the girls are separated, then there is a girl in between Carla and Lluisa, or in between Carla and Maria.
Then (x+3) + x = 12;  x + 3 + x = 12; 2x = 9; x=4.5. This is wrong. Let's rephrase: Carla is between Lluisa and Maria. If Carla is between Lluisa and Maria, there are 12 between Lluisa and Maria, if Carla is 3 girls less from Maria, the number of girls from Carla to Maria will be x, from Lluisa to Carla is x+3. Maria is 16th
Lluisa ... Carla ... Maria (16)
x + x + 3 = 12
2x = 9
x = 4.5
If Lluisa is before Carla and Carla is before Maria:
Let x = number of girls between Carla and Maria
Then x+3 = Number of girls between Lluisa and Carla.
Total girls between Lluisa and Maria = 12
x + (x+3) = 12; 2x+3=12 => 2x=9  x=4.5 (not valid).

Maria is in the 16th position. Let's assume the 12 girls are between Lluisa and Maria, so Lluisa is before Maria and the distance is 12, and 3 more between Lluisa and Carla that from Carla to Maria:
Lluisa - Carla - Maria
x+3 girls between Lluisa and Carla; x girls between Carla and Maria.
Lluisa - (x+3) - Carla - (x) - Maria
The position of Maria is 16th
(x+3) + x = 12 girls between Lluisa and Maria; 2x + 3 = 12; 2x = 9 (not integer).
Lets assume that Carla is before Lluisa. Maria is in 16th.
Carla-Lluisa-Maria. The same approach. If there are 12 girls between Lluisa and Maria; and there are 3 more between Lluisa and Carla than from Carla to Maria, and the 16th is Maria. Carla and Lluisa are before Maria.
Girls between Lluisa and Maria is 12.
Let x = girls between Carla and Maria.
x + 3 is the number of girls between Lluisa and Carla.
So x + x+3 = 12 so 2x = 9 not integers
The position should be after 8th.
Lets suppose that the girls are:
Lluisa, then Carla, then Maria. Then
Lluisa - Carla - Maria. Maria is in the 16th.
Let X be the number of girls from Carla to Maria.
Then X+3 will be the girls from Lluisa to Carla
so X + X+3 = 12 girls between Lluisa and Maria. so 2X=9 (not integers.
Let's try to determine where the 12 girls are located, so there is one possible arrangement: Lluisa-x-Carla-y-Maria:
x + y + 1 = 12; and y = x+3, so x + x + 3 + 1 = 12; 2x = 8, x = 4; y = 7, so Lluisa 1-4-Carla-7-Maria, Maria is 16, Carla is 4+1+1 = 6 before Maria, and it is in the 9th position.
Lluisa - 4 - Carla - 7 - Maria
Maria = 16
Carla +7 + 1 = 16, Carla = 8.
Lluisa - 4 - Carla - 7 - Maria. Maria is in the 16th, Carla is 8, Lluisa is 4, and Maria is in the 16th
Carla is 8.
But that is 8. Then we calculate the position of Carla:
Carla is 8.
