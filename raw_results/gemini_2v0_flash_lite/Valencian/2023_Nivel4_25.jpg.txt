Raonament:
1. **Initial state:** The cup is half milk and half coffee. This means there's 1/2 coffee.
2. **First drink:** Laura drinks 1/4 of the mixture. The proportion of coffee remains the same (1/2 of the total).
3. **First refill:** She fills the cup with milk. The new amount of coffee is 3/4 * 1/2 = 3/8.
4. **Second drink:** She drinks 1/4 of the mixture. The proportion of coffee remains the same. so the coffee left is 3/8 * 3/4 = 9/32.
5. **Second refill:** She fills the cup with milk again, that has 3/4 of the total cup is milk, and 1/4 is the mixture of the original cup, thus making the proportion of coffee to total content equal to 9/32.
6. **Final coffee/milk ratio:** The total amount of coffee is the remaining quantity of coffee divided by the total amount of the cup. The total ammount will be 1 (full cup). So the proportion of coffee is 9/32. The amount of milk is 1 - 9/32 = 23/32.  The ratio is 9/32 / (1-9/32) = 9/23.
