Raonament: A prism has two bases and lateral faces. The number of lateral faces is equal to the number of sides of the bases. The total number of faces is the sum of the two bases and the lateral faces. If a prism has 2018 faces, and it always have two bases, the lateral faces must be 2018 - 2 = 2016. The base is a polygon with n sides, which is also equal to the number of lateral faces. So the base has 2016 sides. A prism has vertices on the base on the top and on the bottom, so the number of vertices will be 2 * n (n = number of sides on the base). Therefore, the prism will have 2 * 2016 = 4032 vertices.
