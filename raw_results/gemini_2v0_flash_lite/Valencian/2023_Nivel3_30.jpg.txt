1.  **Initial state:** Al√≠cia has a cup with 1/2 milk and 1/2 coffee.
2.  **First step:** She drinks 1/4 of the cup. The remaining mixture is (3/4) \* (1/2 milk + 1/2 coffee) = 3/8 milk + 3/8 coffee.
3.  **Second step:** She fills the cup with milk.  The milk added is (1/4 cup), so now the cup has 3/8 coffee + (3/8 + 2/8) milk, which is 3/8 coffee + 5/8 milk. She then drinks 1/4 of the total, which is 1/4 of what's in the cup (which represents the full cup's worth now) or 1/4 (3/8 coffee + 5/8 milk). So we need to calculate the result:
    *   coffee after the second step (3/8) * 3/4 = 9/32 coffee
    *   milk after the second step = (5/8) \* 3/4 = 15/32 milk
4.  **Third step:** She fills the cup with milk again (1/4 cup). The cup now has 9/32 coffee + (15/32 + 8/32) milk = 9/32 coffee + 23/32 milk.
5.  **Final ratio:**  The question is asking the proportion of coffee relative to the total of coffee + milk, which is 9/32 coffee / (9/32 + 23/32 milk) = 9/32 / (32/32).  The proportion of coffee to milk is 9/32 / 23/32
    *   The ratio of coffee to milk is 9/23. The proportion of coffee / (coffee + milk) = 9 / (9+23) = 9/32.
    *   However, the question wants coffee / (coffee + milk). So we need to sum coffee + milk
    *   The total coffee is 9/32
    *   The total milk is 23/32
    *   Therefore the result is the coffee over the (coffee + milk), so 9/32
    *   Then we simplify it which gives us 9/(9+23) = 9/32

The proportion of coffee / total liquid is 9/32. The problem stated the answer to be the ratio of coffee/milk, which is 9/23.

Therefore:
Ratio of coffee to milk: 9/23 (final)
