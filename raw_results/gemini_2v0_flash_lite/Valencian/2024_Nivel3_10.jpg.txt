Raonament:
Let's denote the length of a cart as 'x' and the length of the overlapping part of the cart as 'y'.
When four carts are nested, the total length is 108 cm. This means that the length can be represented as: x + 3y = 108
When ten carts are nested, the total length is 168 cm, so this means: x + 9y = 168
We have a system of two equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
6y = 168 - 108 = 60
So y = 60/6 = 10 cm.
Now substitute y into the first equation: x + 3*10 = 108, which gives x + 30 = 108.
Then, x = 108 - 30 = 78 cm.
The length of a cart is 78 cm.
