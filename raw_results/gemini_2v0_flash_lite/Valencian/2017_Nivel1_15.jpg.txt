Raonament:  The figure is composed of smaller equilateral triangles. The question asks for the maximum number of triangles that can be "destroyed" (presumably removed from the larger figure) by removing one of the segments forming the triangles. Examining the figure, we can see how many triangles one segment is part of. A segment on the outside of the larger figure forms one triangle. Interior segments form two, three, or four triangles. By selecting a segment, one can remove at most 4 triangles. The question has no clear answer, which suggests some hidden assumptions, but the segments that create the most triangles would be those that lie in the center or are connected to the center of the figure. By choosing some of these segments, we can see that up to 4 triangles could be eliminated.
