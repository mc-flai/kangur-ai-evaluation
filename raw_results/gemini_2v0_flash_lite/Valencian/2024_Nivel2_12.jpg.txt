Let's denote the price of a pastry as 'x'. The problem states that a pastry and a half (1.5x) costs 60€ more than a quarter of a pastry (0.25x). We can formulate the equation: 1.  5x = x + 60 + 0.25x. Simplify to 1.5x = 0.25x + 60. This can be written as x = 0.25x + 60, which is x - 0.25x = 60, which leads to 0.75x = 60.  Dividing by 0.75, we get x = 60 / 0.75 = 80.
The problem states: A pastry and a half cost 60€ more than a quarter of a pastry.
So 1.5x = 0.25x + 60
then, 1.25x = 60
Therefore x = 60/1.25 = 48.
