Razonamiento: The square is divided into three equal areas by CM and CN. Since the sides of the square are 3 cm, the total area of the square is 3*3=9 cm². Each of the three regions has an area of 9/3=3 cm². We need to find the length of DM.
Let AM = x. The area of triangle CDM is 3. Then (3* (3-x))/2 = 3. This results in 3-x = 2, and x=1 cm. Thus AM = 1cm. AD = 3 cm, so DM = AD-AM = 3-1=2 cm.

Respuesta: D)
