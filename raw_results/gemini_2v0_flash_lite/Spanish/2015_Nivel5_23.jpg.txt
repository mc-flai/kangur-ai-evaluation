Razonamiento:
The question asks how many two-digit numbers can be written as the sum of six (and only six) distinct powers of 2, including 2^0. Powers of 2 are 2^0=1, 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32, 2^6=64, etc.
Let's consider the smallest sum: 1+2+4+8+16+32=63.
Since 63 is a two-digit number, there is at least one solution, using the powers 2^0 to 2^5.
Let's look at another possible set of six distinct powers of 2 that give us a sum within the two-digit range:
The next lowest sum, must involve one greater power, say 2^6 = 64, which gives 64 + x < 100.
64 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 95. This works.
The question states that the powers of 2 are distinct, so let's test other combinations:
The smallest sum is: 1+2+4+8+16+32=63.
Another possibility is: 1+2+4+8+16+64=95.
Try to include 32 and 64:
32+64+1+2+4 = 103, too large.
No other sums exist.
