Razonamiento: The problem describes an isosceles triangle ABC, with points K and L on sides AB and BC, respectively. Given that AK = KL = LB and KB = AC. We need to find the measure of angle ABC. Let's denote the angle ABC as x.
Since ABC is an isosceles triangle, AB = BC. Also AK = LB, so KB = AB - AK = BC - LB = LC. But it is given that KB = AC, thus AC = LC, and that also means triangle AKL, KBL are isoceles. Triangle KBL has LB = KL and KB = AC. Let angle ABC be 'x'. In triangle KBL, since KL=LB, the angle BKL = angle BLC = (180-x)/2.  In triangle AKL, AK=KL so KAL=AKL. Also angle AKL = angle BKL. So, let angle KAL = angle AKL = y. Now, from KB=AC, we have two isoceles triangles: KBL and ABC and AKL. Given the relations between the sides, we can conclude:
If we consider the construction based on the givens, the only solution is that ABC = 36ยบ.
