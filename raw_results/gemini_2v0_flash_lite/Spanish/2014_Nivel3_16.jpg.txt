Razonamiento:
1.  Let's denote the angle DAB as α. According to the problem, the obtuse angle between BH and AD is 4α.
2.  Since BH is the altitude, the angle BHA is a right angle (90°).
3.  Consider triangle ABH. The sum of the angles in this triangle is 180°. Therefore, angle HAB + angle ABH + angle BHA = 180°.
4.  Angle HAB is the angle we want to find, which is CAB. Angle BHA = 90°.
5.  Angle ABH = 180° - 90° - CAB.
6. The angle between BH and AD is labeled as 4α. The angle BAD (α) is between AD and AB. Because AD bisects the angle BAC, the angle CAD will also be equal to α. Since the angle HAB = CAB, the angle DAB is α and angle CAD is α. Then, angle BAC = 2α.
7.  Consider the triangle ABD. Angle ADB is supplementary to the angle formed by 4α, which can be expressed as 180° - 4α.
8.  The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. So, in triangle ABD, DAB + ABD + ADB = 180°. In this triangle, angle BAD = α, and angle ADB = 180° - 4α. Therefore,  α + ABD + (180° - 4α) = 180° which simplifies to ABD = 3α.
9. Also, the line BH is perpendicular to AC, so the angle HAB is the angle CAB.
10. The angle ABC is the angle ABH and this angle equals 3α. Also, we know that ABC + BAC + ACB = 180°. The line AD bisects angle BAC, which gives us the formula BAC = 2*α.
11. We have the ABC is 3α so we substitute this into the formula.
12. The angle CAB is the angle HAB, which is 180-90-3α = 3α.
13. We have the formula ABC + BAC + ACB = 180°, and it is also equal to 3α + 2α + 90-2α= 180.
14. So, 3α + 2α + 90-2α= 180 implies 3α=90. Then, 3α=90. This means that 3α=90/3.  This gives us CAB is 90/3 = 30°.
