Here's the solution:

Razonamiento:
1. **Ratio of Correct to Incorrect:** The ratio of correct to incorrect answers is 7:2. This means for every 7 correct answers, there are 2 incorrect answers.
2. **Difference:** The difference between correct and incorrect answers is 25.
3. **Difference in Ratio:**  The difference in the ratio is 7 - 2 = 5.
4. **Value of One Ratio Part:** Since the difference in answers is 25, and the difference in the ratio is 5, one part of the ratio represents 25 / 5 = 5 questions.
5. **Total Questions:** The total ratio parts are 7 (correct) + 2 (incorrect) = 9.  Therefore, the total number of questions is 9 * 5 = 45.
