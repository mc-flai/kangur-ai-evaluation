Razonamiento:
1. **Calculate the volume of the first vase:** The first vase has a square base with a side of 5 cm and a height of 40 cm. The volume of the first vase is then side * side * height = 5 cm * 5 cm * 40 cm = 1000 cm³. We know the first vase holds 1 liter, which is equal to 1000 cm³.
2. **Calculate the dimensions of the second vase:** The second vase has a base side that is double the side of the first vase, so it's 2 * 5 cm = 10 cm. Its height is half the height of the first vase, which is 40 cm / 2 = 20 cm.
3. **Calculate the volume of the second vase:** The volume of the second vase is side * side * height = 10 cm * 10 cm * 20 cm = 2000 cm³.
4. **Convert to liters:** Since 1000 cm³ equals 1 liter, the second vase has a capacity of 2000 cm³ / 1000 cm³/liter = 2 liters.
