Razonamiento:
1. **Visualizar the problem**: The image shows a semicircle with a square inscribed such that two vertices lie on the diameter and the other two on the curved edge. The radius of the semicircle is given as 1 cm.
2. **Define variables**: Let's consider the side of the square to be 's'. The center of the semicircle is the midpoint of the base of the square.
3. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem**:  We can create a right triangle by drawing a line from the center of the semicircle to a vertex on the semicircle. This line is the radius (1 cm). The legs of the right triangle are s/2 (half the side of the square, from the center to where the side of the square touches the diameter) and s (the height of the square).
4. **Set up the equation**: The Pythagorean theorem gives us: (s/2)^2 + s^2 = 1^2
5. **Solve for s**: Simplify the equation: s^2/4 + s^2 = 1  =>  5s^2/4 = 1  => s^2 = 4/5
6. **Find the area**: The area of the square is s^2, which is 4/5 cm^2.
