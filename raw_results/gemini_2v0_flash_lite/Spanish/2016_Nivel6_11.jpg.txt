Razonamiento:
The equation a + 2 = b - 2 = 2c = d/2 is given. We need to find which of the variables a, b, c, or d has the greatest value. Let's rewrite each part of the equation to express a, b, c and d in terms of one variable:
a + 2 = 2c => a = 2c - 2
b - 2 = 2c => b = 2c + 2
d/2 = 2c => d = 4c

Since a, b, c, and d are all positive integers, c must be at least 1. Let's consider the relationships between the variables:
*   a = 2c - 2
*   b = 2c + 2
*   c = c
*   d = 4c

Comparing the expressions, d will always have the largest value as it is equal to 4c.

Respuesta: D) d
