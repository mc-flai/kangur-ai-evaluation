Razonamiento: The problem states that the sums of the numbers in each 2x2 square must be equal.  Let's call the missing number 'x'. We can create two 2x2 squares using the given numbers and the missing number. Square 1: top left corner, sum = 3 + y + 2 + x. Square 2: top right, sum = 1 + y + x + z. Also, we can see that the numbers y and z are unknown. However, the text states that the sum is equal in the 2x2 squares. Given that x is the only number that changes between them, the question is asking us to select the number where the sum is equal.  The sum of the first 2x2 square is 3 + a + 2 + x, the sum of the bottom right 2x2 square is 1 + a + x + ?. To ensure both sums are equal, then we can find that the missing value, "?", must be 0.
