Here's the breakdown:

*   **Understanding the Constraints:** We need 4-digit numbers where:
    *   All digits are even.
    *   The digits are all different.
    *   The last digit is the sum of the first three.

*   **Finding the Numbers:**
    *   Let the first three digits be *a*, *b*, and *c*. The last digit is *a + b + c*.
    *   Since the last digit is even, the sum *a + b + c* must also be even. This means either all three of *a, b, c* are even, or one of *a, b, c* is even and the other two are odd. Since all digits must be even, the only option is that all of a,b,c are even.
    *   Since we know 2024 fits the criteria, lets see if we can find any more:
        *   We know that the first digit can't be 0 or 1, the first three digits can't all be the same because that would make the last digit larger, also all digits are unique.
        *   If we start with the first digit as 2, we know that the sum of all three must be <= 8.
            *   2024
            *   2406
        *   If we start with the first digit as 4, we know that the sum of the other two digits must be <=4
            *   4026
        *   If we start with the first digit as 6, we know that the sum of the other two digits must be <=2
            *   6028
        *   If we start with the first digit as 8, we know that the sum of the other two digits must be <=0.
            *   8008, but this doesn't have three unique numbers.
    *   Therefore, the valid numbers are 2024, 2406, 4026, and 6028.

*   **Counting the Numbers:** We found 4 numbers.

*   **Reasoning:** The solution is found by identifying the constraints, generating valid combinations, and accounting for all possible cases.

*   **Answer:** A) 4
