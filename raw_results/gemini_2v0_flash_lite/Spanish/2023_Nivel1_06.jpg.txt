Razonamiento: Ana has 5 disks and wants to build a tower with 4 disks, and each disk must be smaller than the one below. This is a combination problem.  We need to choose 4 disks out of 5. Since the order matters (the size of the disks), we are looking for the number of combinations of 5 disks taken 4 at a time, and then we order them by size.  This is a permutation of choosing 4 items from 5, where order is important.  There are 5 ways to choose which disk NOT to use in the tower. Once we have chosen our 4 disks, their relative sizes determine the tower uniquely.  Therefore, if we have 5 disks, we need to find out the number of combinations, then the number of ways we can arrange 4 disks out of 5. This can be solved by the combination formula: nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!) or 5 choose 4 = 5!/(4!1!) =5. Therefore there are 5 ways to build this tower.
