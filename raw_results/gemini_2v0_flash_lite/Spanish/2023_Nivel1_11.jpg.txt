Razonamiento: The question states that Manuela wrote three consecutive two-digit numbers using symbols instead of digits. The given sequence is square, diamond, heart, triangle, heart, square.  This implies the sequence of numbers is increasing. The sequence of symbols seems to repeat. We need to determine the next number in the sequence. The pattern suggests: 1st number -> square-diamond, 2nd number -> heart-triangle, 3rd number -> heart-square.  Following the pattern, the next number in the sequence should be heart-diamond.
