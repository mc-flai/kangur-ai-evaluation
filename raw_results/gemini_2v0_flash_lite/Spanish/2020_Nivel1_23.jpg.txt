Here's the reasoning and answer:

*   **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the minimum number of moves to get all the tokens to show the same color. Each move flips 3 tokens.

*   **Analyzing the Initial State:** The image shows 4 black and 5 white tokens.

*   **Finding the Solution:**
    1.  **First move:** Flip 3 white tokens to get all black.
    2.  **Second move:** Flip 3 black tokens to get all white.
    3.  **Third move:** Flip 3 black tokens again to get all white.

*   **Counting Moves:** This takes a minimum of 3 moves.

*   **Reasoning:** We can either change all white to black or all black to white. The optimal solution involves minimizing the number of flips. We can see that either three moves are required.

*   **Reasoning:**
    *   Move 1: Flip the first 3 white ones to become black ones. The state becomes: 7 black ones and 2 white ones.
    *   Move 2: Flip the next 3 white ones to become black ones. The state becomes: 4 black ones and 5 white ones.
    *   Move 3: Flip the next 3 white ones to become black ones. The state becomes: 1 black one and 8 white ones.

*   **Answer:** C) 3

Razonamiento: Se requiere un m√≠nimo de tres movimientos para alcanzar un color uniforme.
