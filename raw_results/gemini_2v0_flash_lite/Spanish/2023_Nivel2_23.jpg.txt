Razonamiento:
1. **Analyze the given information:** We have triangle ABC with angle ACB = 32 degrees. Also, DA = AC and BE = BC. We need to find the measure of angle DCE.
2. **Identify isosceles triangles:** Because DA = AC, triangle DAC is an isosceles triangle, meaning angle ADC = angle ACD. Similarly, because BE = BC, triangle BEC is an isosceles triangle and angle BEC = angle BCE.
3. **Angle sum of a triangle:** In triangle ABC, angle BAC + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180 degrees. Since we know that angle ACB = 32 degrees, we have angle BAC + angle ABC = 180 - 32 = 148 degrees.
4. **Consider external angles:** Angle DCE is an external angle of the triangle ABC. The sum of the external angles of a triangle equals 360 degrees. Let angle DAC be x, then angle ADC is x, and angle ACB equals to 32 degrees. Also, let angle CBE be y, then angle BEC is y, and angle ACB equals to 32 degrees. Angle DCE = angle DCA + angle ACB + angle BCE = x + 32 + y.
5. **Find the angles using Isosceles Triangles:** In triangle DAC, angle CAD = (180 - angle ACD)/2 = (180 - angle CAD)/2. Since angle CAB + angle BAD = 180 and angle ABC + angle EBC = 180. Using the isosceles properties. Angle DAC=Angle ADC, Angle EBC=Angle BEC.
6. **Final deduction:** angle DCA + angle CAB + angle ABC + angle BCE = 180 + 148 + angle DCE = 360. Consider the angles at A and B; Since the angles are same in the sides of the triangle and adding angle DCE = 148+32+180; So DCA+BCE. Therefore, by inspection, we have that angle DCE is equivalent to angle BAC + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180+32 =106.
