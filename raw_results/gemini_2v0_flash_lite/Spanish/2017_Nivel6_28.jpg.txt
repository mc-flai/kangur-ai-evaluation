Here's the solution to question 28:

Razonamiento:
1. **Equation 1:** |x| + x + y = 5
   * If x >= 0, then |x| = x, and the equation becomes 2x + y = 5.
   * If x < 0, then |x| = -x, and the equation becomes -x + x + y = 5, which simplifies to y = 5.

2. **Equation 2:** x + |y| - y = 10
   * Case 1: If y >= 0, then |y| = y, and the equation becomes x + y - y = 10, simplifying to x = 10.
   * Case 2: If y < 0, then |y| = -y, and the equation becomes x - y - y = 10, simplifying to x - 2y = 10.

3. **Combining the Cases**
    * Let's consider y = 5 (from x < 0 in Equation 1).
    * Since x = 10 (from y >= 0 in Equation 2), but in Equation 1 it implies that y = 5, thus, using x = 10 contradicts the condition of x < 0 of the first equation.
    * Since the condition x < 0 doesn't work, we can now discard it. Therefore, we will use the other equation.

4. **Case 1: x >= 0**
    * With x >= 0, we use 2x + y = 5 (from Equation 1)
    * Combining with x = 10 (from Equation 2), we can't apply the last equation of Equation 1.
    * We need to use x - 2y = 10 (from Equation 2) and with 2x + y = 5 (from Equation 1). Solving the system of equations (multiplying the first equation by 2: 2x - 4y = 20), subtracting the last equation from the multiplied equation yields:
    * (2x - 4y) - (2x + y) = 20 - 5
    * -5y = 15
    * y = -3
    * Then, using 2x + y = 5, we replace y: 2x - 3 = 5,  2x = 8, x = 4

5. **Finding x + y**
   * We have x = 4 and y = -3
   * x + y = 4 + (-3) = 1
