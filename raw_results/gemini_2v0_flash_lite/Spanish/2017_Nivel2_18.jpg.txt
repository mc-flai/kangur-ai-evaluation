Razonamiento: The offer is "buy 3 and pay 2". So, for every 3 candies, you only pay for 2. First, divide 50 by 3 to find how many sets of 3 candies there are: 50 / 3 = 16 sets with a remainder of 2. Each set of 3 candies costs 2 candies worth of money. Each candy costs 3€. Therefore, for 3 candies, you pay 2*3 = 6€. For 16 sets, it will cost 16 * 6€ = 96€. The remaining 2 candies cost 2 * 3€ = 6€. The total is 96€ + 6€ = 102€.
