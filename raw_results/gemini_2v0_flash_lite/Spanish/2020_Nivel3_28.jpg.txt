Razonamiento: The three children walk a total of 50 meters around the perimeter of the pool to meet their coach.  The perimeter of the pool is 2(10) + 2(25) = 20 + 50 = 70 meters.  The children are walking in the shortest possible path, so the problem implies that their coach is at the side of the pool.
We need to consider possible positions of the coach, and the children's paths.
- If the three children walk along adjacent sides from a corner, then the total distance would be 10 + 25 + 15 = 50, so that is a correct configuration. So the coach is on a 15m side.
- In that configuration, the fourth child is on the opposite corner. The shortest distance for the coach to reach the child is 10m.
- If the coach is by a 10-meter side, and the children are at the adjacent corners, the total distance would be 25 + 10 + 15.
The missing side is 25-20. The shortest distance is the side that is 10 m.
If the 3 children walk along two edges and a bit more. 10+25=35 so we have 15 m left.
Therefore, the trainer is at the 15 m, the distance to travel for the child at the corner is 10.
The 4th kid is at the fourth corner, so the shortest distance for the coach is 10 m.
