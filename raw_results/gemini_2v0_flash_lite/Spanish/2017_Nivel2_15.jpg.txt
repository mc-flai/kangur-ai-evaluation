Razonamiento: The area of a triangle is calculated by the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height. To determine which modification results in the largest area increase, we can analyze the impact of each option:

A) Increases the base to 70 cm. Area = (1/2) * 70 * 40 = 1400 cm^2.
B) Increases the height to 60 cm. Area = (1/2) * 50 * 60 = 1500 cm^2.
C) Increases the base to 60 cm and height to 50 cm. Area = (1/2) * 60 * 50 = 1500 cm^2.
D) Increases the base to 65 cm and the height to 45 cm. Area = (1/2) * 65 * 45 = 1462.5 cm^2.
E) Increases the base to 55 cm and the height to 55 cm. Area = (1/2) * 55 * 55 = 1512.5 cm^2

Comparing the areas, the option that results in the largest area increase is E.

Respuesta: E)
