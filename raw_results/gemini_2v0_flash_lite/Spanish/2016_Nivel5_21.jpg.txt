Razonamiento: The question asks for the length of a plant that spirals around a 1 m tall pole for 5 turns. The circumference is given as 15 cm or 0.15 m.  Each spiral adds a length equivalent to the circumference multiplied by the square root of (1 + (pitch / circumference)^2), where the pitch is the height gain per turn. Assuming a constant proportion for the height increase, we can estimate the length.  Since the plant goes around the pole 5 times and the pole is 1 m tall, the "pitch" (vertical distance covered per turn) would be 1m / 5 turns = 0.2 m/turn. The approximate length of the plant is a function of the pole height and the circumference.
Let's calculate:
The length of the plant can be seen like the hypotenuse of 5 identical right triangles stacked together.
The length of the base would be the circumference times the number of turns = 0.15 m * 5 = 0.75 m.
The height would be 1 m (the height of the pole).
Applying the Pythagorean theorem:
Length = sqrt( (0.15 m * 5)^2 + (1 m)^2 ) = sqrt(0.75^2 + 1^2) = sqrt (0.5625 + 1) = sqrt(1.5625) = approximately 1.25m.
