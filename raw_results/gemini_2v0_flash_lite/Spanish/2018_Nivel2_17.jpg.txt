Razonamiento:
1. **Calculate the total number of pages:** If reading 18 pages per day takes 24 days, the book has 18 * 24 = 432 pages.
2. **Calculate the reading time at a slower rate:** If the same book is read at 16 pages per day, it will take 432 / 16 = 27 days.
3. **Find the difference:** The difference in reading time is 27 - 24 = 3 days.
