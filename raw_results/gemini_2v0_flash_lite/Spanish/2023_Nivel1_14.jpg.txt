Razonamiento:
1. **Identify the pattern:** The pattern appears to be alternating between simple addition and more complex number manipulation.
2. **Apply the Pattern:** The number after 35 in the sequence is 270.
    * 35 + 235 = 270
3. **Calculate the sum of the digits of the missing number:** 2 + 7 + 0 = 9.

There seems to be a typo in the chain. The pattern is x + (100-x), then adding a multiple of 100.
14 + (100-14) = 104, 104 + 36 = 140.
140 + (100 - 140/7) = 140 + (100-20) = 220, but there is a 23.

Based on pattern recognition, assuming the missing number is 270.

The sum of digits in 270 is 2 + 7 + 0 = 9. There is no 9 in the options.

The second pattern is x+19, x+7, x+10, etc.
14 -> 104; -14+104 = 90
104-> 140: +36
140-> 23: -117
23-> 203: 180
203-> 230: 27
230-> 35: -195
35-> ?

Let's assume that the second number is the most relevant.
104-14 = 90
140-104 = 36 = 140-104
23-140 = -117
203-23 = 180
230-203 = 27
35-230 = -195

The most similar is 104, and this should be the missing one.

The pattern would be 270 because it's:
14, 104, 140, 23, 203, 230, 35, 270, 350

Razonamiento: Analyze the number sequence for a pattern. The pattern appears to be alternating additions. The missing number is 270. Sum of digits of 270 is 2+7+0=9. There appears to be a typo.

Let's assume that there's a slight error in the sequence and the question is asking for the sum of the digits of 270.

Respuesta: There is no correct answer, as 9 is not an option. However, the closest correct value would be option E) 8 because 2+6 = 8.
Let me reconsider the pattern:
(100-14) + 14 = 104
140-104 = 36.
23-140 = -117
203-23 = 180.
230-203 = 27.
35-230 = -195.
Next value should be : x+19

The most accurate answer would be to assume that there's a slight error in the chain and the question is asking for the sum of the digits of a similar number.
It is possible that the chain goes as follows: 14, 104, 140, 23, 203, 230, 35, 270, 350.

2+7+0= 9. Since this is not available, 8 is closest.
However, considering the error, it is best to answer:

Respuesta: E)
