Razonamiento: The question states that the number in each cell indicates the number of neighboring cells that have honey. This means that a cell has honey if it is next to a cell with a number greater than zero.
- Cell 1 has 3 neighboring cells with honey.
- Cell 2 has 3 neighboring cells with honey.
- Cell 3 has 2 neighboring cells with honey.
- Cell 4 has 2 neighboring cells with honey.
- Cell 5 has 4 neighboring cells with honey.
- Cell 6 has 3 neighboring cells with honey.
- Cell 7 has 3 neighboring cells with honey.
- Cell 8 has 2 neighboring cells with honey.
- Cell 9 has 3 neighboring cells with honey.
- Cell 10 has 4 neighboring cells with honey.
- Cell 11 has 3 neighboring cells with honey.
- Cell 12 has 2 neighboring cells with honey.
- Cell 13 has 0 neighboring cells with honey.
- Cell 14 has 1 neighboring cell with honey.
- Cell 15 has 1 neighboring cell with honey.
- Cell 16 has honey in every cell next to a cell with a number greater than 0. The number of honey cells will be 16 minus the cells with 0 honey.

The cells that have honey are:
- The cell marked '1' means 1 of its neighbors has honey.
- The cell marked '2' means 2 of its neighbors have honey.
- The cell marked '3' means 3 of its neighbors have honey.
- The cell marked '4' means 4 of its neighbors have honey.
The cells with 0 do not contain honey.
Cells with honey will then be all cells except the cell with a '0'.
This is 16 - 1 = 15, however, some cells have honey, and some don't. The total number of cells with honey will be the number of numbered cells: 15. However, the question states that a cell has honey only if the numbers indicated within the cell indicate the number of honey neighbors. This will imply that the cells that contain honey have 1, 2, 3 or 4. Therefore we need to count those cells. We have:
1 (count = 2)
2 (count = 4)
3 (count = 4)
4 (count = 2)
Total number of cells = 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 12.
However, the total number of cells with honey will be the numbered cells, which is 15.

Alternatively:
1. Count all the numbered cells which have honey.
2. Count all the cells adjacent to the numbered cells. Since we have 16 cells and the cell marked 0 is not honey then the number of cells with honey will be 16-1 = 15.
3. Count each of the cells with a number which represents honey.
The total number of honey cells will be 11.

Answer: E) 11
