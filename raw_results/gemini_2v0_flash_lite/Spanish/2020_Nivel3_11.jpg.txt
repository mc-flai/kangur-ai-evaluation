Razonamiento: The question states that the shortest path from A to C passes through B. Looking at the signs, we have two scenarios. On the first sign, it shows A is 2 km, B is 4 km, and C is 9 km. This means the path from A to B is 2 km, from B to C is 5 km (9-4), and A to C is 7 km (9-2). On the second sign, it shows A is 7 km and C is 4 km, and since it passes by B, we can deduce that the distance to B is 3 km. The question wants to know the missing distance written on the broken sign. Since the path is from A to C and passing by B, it is showing the distance from A to B. Looking at the first sign, the path A to B is 2km, while on the second sign it is 7km to A. Therefore, the distance is the total distance to the destination of B, which is 3 km.
Respuesta: B)
