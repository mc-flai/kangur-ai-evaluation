Razonamiento:
1. **Understand the Problem:** Alba has four strips of paper. She overlaps two to get a 50 cm strip. We need to find how much she needs to overlap the other two strips to get a 56 cm strip.
2. **Analyze the overlap:** Overlapping two strips of length *x* by a length *y* gives a total length of *x + x - y = 50 cm*. We know *x* and *y* are the same for all the strips.
3. **Calculate the length of each strip:** Two strips with a 10cm overlap equal 50cm, so the original length of each strip is (50cm + 10cm)/2 = 30 cm. This can also be represented with the equation: 30cm + 30cm - 10cm = 50 cm.
4. **Calculate the overlap needed:** Alba needs to create a 56cm strip from the other two. Because the original length of each strip is 30 cm and the total needed is 56 cm, we can make a similar equation: 30 cm + 30 cm - overlap = 56 cm. So, 60cm - overlap = 56 cm. Therefore the overlap = 60cm - 56 cm = 4 cm.
