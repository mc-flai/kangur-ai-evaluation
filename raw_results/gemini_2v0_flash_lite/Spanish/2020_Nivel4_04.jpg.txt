Razonamiento: The question describes an arithmetic progression. The terms are n, 2n-2, 4n-4,... The common difference can be found by subtracting consecutive terms: (2n-2) - n = n-2 and (4n-4) - (2n-2) = 2n-2. Since this is an arithmetic progression, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Thus, n-2 = 2n-2, which implies n = 0. The terms of the sequence become 0, -2, -4,... The fourth term is found by using the common difference which is (2n-2)-n = n-2, so with n=0, the common difference is -2. The fourth term is therefore -4 + (-2) = -6
