Razonamiento: The question asks for the minimum number of children in a family where each child has at least two brothers and at least one sister. Let's consider the possibilities:

*   If there are 3 children, this means that there are 2 brothers and 1 sister. Each boy has one brother (so, one brother) and one sister. The girl has two brothers. This configuration satisfies the given conditions.
*   If there are 4 children (2 boys, 2 girls), each boy has one brother and two sisters. Each girl has two brothers and one sister. However, the problem specifies that a child has at least two brothers.

Therefore, if there are 3 children the constraints of the problem are met.
