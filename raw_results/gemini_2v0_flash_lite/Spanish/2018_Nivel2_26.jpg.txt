Razonamiento:
Let's denote the equal sides of the isosceles triangle as 'x' and the unequal side as 17 cm. The perimeter of the original triangle is 2x + 17. When a median is drawn to one of the equal sides, it creates two new triangles.  The difference in the perimeters of these two new triangles is 10 cm. The median's length must be considered when calculating the perimeter of the new triangles. The length of the median is 'x/2'. The original triangle perimeter is equal to 2x + 17. The difference between the two resulting triangles is x - 17 = 10, thus x = 27. This should mean that x is 27, and the perimeter is 2(27) + 17 = 54 + 17 = 71cm.
