Razonamiento: The question states that there are nine visible steps. The image shows a cylinder, meaning the steps wrap around it. The full number of steps is the sum of visible and not visible steps. It is assumed that the steps that are not visible are similar to visible steps. We can say that we can count all steps around the cylinder and add the ones hidden by the surface to find the missing steps. The cylinder is a 3D object, which means the steps continue on the other side and the question is asking us to figure the ones we don't see. The steps visible are 9. Looking at the cylinder, we can safely deduce that the total steps on each layer is at least more than 9, and in this particular case we assume that the same number of steps exists in the hidden side. Thus, adding those hidden steps is 9 + 3 = 12, is the best guess.
