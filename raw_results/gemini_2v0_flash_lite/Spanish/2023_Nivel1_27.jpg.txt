1.  **Establish Relationships:** The problem gives us these key equivalencies:
    *   2 hats = 5 skirts
    *   3 skirts = 8 shirts
    *   2 shirts = 3 caps
2.  **Compare Options:** Let's analyze the options:
    *   A) 1 hat + 5 skirts. Convert the hat into skirts. 1 hat = 5/2 skirts. Total skirts: 5/2 + 5 = 15/2 skirts
    *   B) 1 hat + 3 skirts + 1 cap. Convert the hat and cap to skirts. 1 hat = 5/2 skirts, 2 shirts = 3 caps, then, 8 shirts = 12 caps, and 3 skirts = 8 shirts, so 3 skirts = 12 caps, and 1 cap = 1/4 skirt. Total Skirts: 5/2 + 3 + 1/4 = (10+12+1)/4 = 23/4 = 5.75
    *   C) 8 skirts + 6 shirts. Convert the shirts to skirts. 8 shirts = 3 skirts * 8 shirts/8 shirts = 3 skirts. Total Skirts: 8 + 6 *(3/8 skirt)=8+2.25=10.25
    *   D) 37 caps.  We convert caps to skirts. 37 caps = (37/3) * 2 shirts = (37/3)* 2 * 3/8 skirts = 37/4 = 9.25
    *   E) 3 skirts + 3 caps.  Convert the caps to skirts.  3 caps = 2 shirts,  2 shirts = (3/8)*3skirts , so 3 caps = 9/8 skirts. Total skirts: 3 + 9/8 = 3.125
3.  **Determine the Most Expensive:** The option with the highest number of skirts is the most expensive. From above A), is 7.5 skirts, B) is 5.75 skirts, C) is 10.25 skirts, D) is 9.25 skirts, E) is 3.125.

    Option C (8 skirts + 6 shirts) is the most expensive.

Respuesta: C)
