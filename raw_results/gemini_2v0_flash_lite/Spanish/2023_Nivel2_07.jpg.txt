Razonamiento:
1. **Find the unknown side length of the middle rectangle:** The area of the middle rectangle is 48 and one side is 2.  Therefore the other side is 48 / 2 = 24.
2. **Deduce the length of the top side of the bottom rectangle:** The top side of the bottom rectangle is equal to the 24 from the middle rectangle plus the known side 3 from the middle rectangle which equals to 24+3 = 27.
3. **Calculate the unknown side length:** The area of the bottom rectangle is 77, and one side is 27. The unknown side is therefore 77 / 27, the length asked for in the question. I have an error in my calculation, the side is 2+3=5, and the unknown is 77/11 = 7.
4. **Final Answer:**  The final answer is 7.
