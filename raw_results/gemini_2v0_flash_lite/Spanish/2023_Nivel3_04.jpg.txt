Razonamiento: The problem states that the sum of the numbers in the two vertices of each side is equal to the number written on that side. We are given the numbers on three sides of the rhombus. The sum of the vertices on the side with the 9 is unknown + 9. The sum of the vertices on the side with the 13 is unknown + unknown. The sum of the vertices on the side with the 8 is unknown + 8. If we follow the known values we can know the values on the corners:
If we label the unknown top left corner "x", then we can infer the top vertices are:
- Top side: x + 8 =  ?
- Right side: 9 + ? =  ?
- Bottom Side: 13 + ? =  ?
- Left Side: x + ? =  ?

Since 8 + 13 = 21.
Since 9 + 12 = 21.
The value of the ? would be 12
