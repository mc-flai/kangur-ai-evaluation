Razonamiento:
1.  Identify powers of 2: We need to find three powers of 2 that sum to 100.
2.  Trial and Error: We can start by trying different powers of 2. The largest possible power of 2 must be less than 100.
3.  Possible Set: 64 + 32 + 4 = 100. This indicates the ages of grandmother, daughter, and granddaughter in this order.
4.  Deduce the Year: The grandmother is 64, the daughter is 32, and the granddaughter is 4. This year we are looking for will be the year when the sum of their ages equals to 100. For the 4-year-old granddaughter to be 4 years old, the current year will have to be 2010 (2010-4=2006).
5.  Granddaughter Birth Year: Therefore, since the granddaughter is 4 years old, she was born in 2010 - 4 = 2006.
