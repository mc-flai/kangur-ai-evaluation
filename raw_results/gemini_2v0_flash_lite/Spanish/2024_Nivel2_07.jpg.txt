Razonamiento:
The problem describes placing four cups on four saucers randomly. We need to determine which statement is correct.

*   **A)** It is possible that none of the cups is on its matching saucer. For example, all cups could be placed on a different saucer.
*   **B)** It is not certain that exactly one cup will be on its corresponding saucer.
*   **C)** It is possible for exactly two cups to be on the correct saucers. Imagine the cups and saucers arranged like: Cup1-Saucer1, Cup2-Saucer2, Cup3-Saucer4, Cup4-Saucer3. Thus, this statement is incorrect.
*   **D)** It is possible for exactly three cups to be on their corresponding saucers. For example, cups 1,2 and 3 can be on their corresponding plates while cup 4 is not.
*   **E)** It is possible that all four cups are on their matching saucers.

The only statement that is always true is that it's possible that no cup matches its saucer.
The statement should be rephrased as: It is possible that none of the cups are in their corresponding saucers.

Response: A)
