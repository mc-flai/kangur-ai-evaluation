Razonamiento: The seats are numbered consecutively from 1 to 26. The numbering starts from the right, meaning the first seat on the right is number 1, and the last seat on the left is number 26. The question asks what number is the 7th seat from the left. If the 7th seat from the left is the seat we are looking for, and if the total number of seats is 26, then to find the number we are looking for, we need to subtract 7 from the total number of seats. This will give us 26 - 7 = 19.
