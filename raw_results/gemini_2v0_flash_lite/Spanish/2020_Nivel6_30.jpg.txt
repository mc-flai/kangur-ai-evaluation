Razonamiento:
1.  **Analyze the initial information:** Adrian knows the color of Carlos' favorite shape, and Belen knows the shape.  They both have some information, but not enough to know Carlos' favorite.
2.  **Adrian's first statement**: "I don't know the favorite figure and I know Belen doesn't know it either." This means Carlos' favorite shape cannot be something only Adrian knows by color or Belen knows by shape. This eliminates a shape with a unique color or shape.
3.  **Belen's statement:** "At first, I didn't know the figure, but now I do." This means Belen, knowing the shapes, could eliminate all shapes but one after hearing Adrian's statement.
4.  **Adrian's second statement:** "Now I know too." Because Belen eliminated all shapes but one, and now Adrian knows as well, then there is only one possible shape left to choose from.
5.  **Elimination of the answer choices:**
    *   The star (A) is black and has a unique shape. However, because Adrian knows the color black, and Belen knows the shape, this means they wouldn't have been able to conclude at first about their favorite shape.
    *   The white square (B): Because the white color is unique and there's only one white shape, and the white shape is only one, Adrian knows the shape and Belen knows the color.
    *   The gray triangle (C): Because the gray color is unique and there's only one gray shape, and the gray shape is only one, Adrian knows the shape and Belen knows the color.
    *   The black square (D): Adrian knows the color and Belen knows the shape. Adrian could not say in his first statement he doesn't know the figure.
    *   The gray circle (E): Belen is able to identify the figure, so this can't be the answer because Adri√°n wouldn't know.
    *   The remaining shapes (hexagon and other circles).

6.  **Apply the logic:** Based on the conversation, the only remaining shape after Belen's turn should be one of the four choices given. Based on the conversation, only the black square has the shape and color known by both.
