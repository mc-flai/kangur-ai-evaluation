Razonamiento: A "primo2" number has exactly three distinct divisors: 1, 2, and itself. This implies the number must be a perfect square of a prime number. For example: If n = 4 (2^2), the divisors are 1, 2 and 4. If n = 9 (3^2), the divisors are 1, 3 and 9, but the problem specifies that 2 must be a divisor, so the number n must be the square of a prime number where the prime is 2, meaning n must be 4. There is only one "primo2" number.
