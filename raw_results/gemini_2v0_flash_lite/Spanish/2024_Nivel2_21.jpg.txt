Razonamiento: The question asks for the sum of the numbers on the faces of the dice that are touching the table. To determine which numbers are on the faces touching the table, we need to add the visible faces, as the dice are cubes there are 6 sides. For the first die, we can see 34, 22, and 8, and we add these numbers. For the second die, we can see 5, 8, and 13. Finally, for the third die, we see 17, 13, and 22. The sum of the visible faces is: 34 + 22 + 8 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 17 + 13 + 22 = 142. Each die should sum to the same amount, so the sum of the face touching the table would be the opposite face of the visible ones. Then we need to find the sum of the face touching the table of each die. The sum of the numbers of each die can be obtained by the values: 34+22+8+x+y+z = sum where x,y,z are not visible and sum should be same for all dice. For the first die we have 34+22+8 = 64. The second die 5+8+13 = 26 and the third die 17+13+22 = 52. The sum is the same for all dice, so from the first die we can see 34+22+8 = 64. Total of the 6 sides of the die is: 34+22+8+x+y+z. As all dice are the same 6-sided dice, then the hidden value of die 2 is: 5+8+13 = 26, the sum of the hidden values is 64-26 = 38. And the hidden value of die 3 is: 17+13+22 = 52. The sum of the hidden values is 64-52 = 12. The sum of all numbers of the sides of a die must always be the same, but the given question indicates they are not convencional dice, then is not clear how to proceed here. Let's assume the question wanted the sum of the numbers on each side touching the table: Die 1, the numbers in the bottom of the cube are: 34+8+22 = 64. Die 2: 5+8+13 = 26. Die 3: 17+13+22 = 52. Sum: 64 + 26 + 52 = 142. But this is not an option here.  If we assume the sum on the face in the bottom is the sum of the rest.
* Die 1: 34+22+8 = 64, the missing face = x. Sum should be the same, so the opposite face touching the table must be x. So the first cube side is 34 and in the bottom it is x.
*Die 2: 5+8+13 = 26, the missing face = x. Sum should be the same, so the opposite face touching the table must be x. So the second cube side is 5 and in the bottom it is x.
*Die 3: 17+13+22 = 52, the missing face = x. Sum should be the same, so the opposite face touching the table must be x. So the third cube side is 17 and in the bottom it is x.
The faces in the table will be: x1, x2, x3 so x1 + x2 + x3 = sum of hidden sides.
If we consider each die and add the values:
Die 1: x = 34+22+8 = 64. so face on table = x1.
Die 2: x = 5+8+13 = 26, so face on table = x2.
Die 3: x = 17+13+22 = 52, so face on table = x3.
We have 3 different values, then the question must mean the number on the table for each die.
The numbers in the faces on the bottom are the opposite number of what we see. So what they are looking for is the following:
* Die 1: face on the table is the opposite of 34, 22, 8.
* Die 2: face on the table is the opposite of 5, 8, 13.
* Die 3: face on the table is the opposite of 17, 13, 22.
So it is impossible to know the value because are not standard dices. But let's try to consider each die as independent.
If we assume that in a standard die the total sides add 27, then:
* Die 1: We can see 34 + 22 + 8 = 64, and we assume the faces on the bottom will be a total sum of (27 - 34) + (27 - 22) + (27-8) which is not correct.
As we have not enough information we must suppose that the question wants the sum of the faces touching the table. so is just: 22+8+13+8+13+22 = 86, as this number is not in the options, so the question is very unclear.
Let's add all the numbers that are visible:
34 + 22 + 8 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 17 + 13 + 22 = 142.
The correct answer is not among the options, and without further information it is impossible to choose the right answer.
