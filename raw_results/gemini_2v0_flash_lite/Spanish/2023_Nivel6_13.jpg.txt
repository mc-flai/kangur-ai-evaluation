Razonamiento: The key is to find a point (x, y) that satisfies the equation regardless of the value of 'a'. We can rewrite the equation as: y = x^3 + 3x^2 + a(x + 2) + 4.  If we set x = -2, the term a(x + 2) becomes zero, eliminating 'a' from the equation. Then we have y = (-2)^3 + 3*(-2)^2 + 4 = -8 + 12 + 4 = 8. Thus the point (-2, 8) lies on the graph. The sum of the coordinates of this point is -2 + 8 = 6. The answer choices don't have the correct sum, so we look for where a makes the equation independent of 'a'.
If we set x+2=0, then x=-2.
y = (-2)^3+3*(-2)^2+a*(-2)+2a+4
y=-8+12-2a+2a+4
y=8
Then the coordinate is (-2,8) and the sum of coordinates is -2+8=6.
There seems to be a mistake as 6 is not one of the available options.

Let's analyze the original equation by factoring out 'a':
y = x^3 + 3x^2 + ax + 2a + 4
y = x^3 + 3x^2 + 4 + a(x + 2)
For the graphs to intersect at a single point, the value of a must not affect the coordinates of the point. We can eliminate the term with 'a' by making (x+2) = 0, then x = -2
Substituting x = -2 into the original equation, we have y = (-2)^3 + 3*(-2)^2 + a*(-2) + 2a + 4
y = -8 + 12 - 2a + 2a + 4
y = 8.
The coordinates of the point are therefore (-2, 8). The question asks for the sum of the coordinates, so -2 + 8 = 6. The point is (-2, 8). The sum is 6. However, it's not in the options so let's go over the work. It's most likely that there is a small error in the given solution set.

Let's revisit our strategy to see if there is any other option.
We have y = x^3 + 3x^2 + ax + 2a + 4. Rearranging, we get:
y = (x^3 + 3x^2 + 4) + a(x+2).
If x = -2, we get y = -8 + 12 + 4 = 8.
The point is (-2, 8) and the sum of coordinates is 6.

The provided answer choices do not include 6, so the answer must not be one of the options listed.
