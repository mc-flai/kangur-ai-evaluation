Razonamiento:
1. **Calculate total cards:** Mario started with 5 packages * 12 cards/package = 60 cards.
2. **Calculate remaining cards:** Mario sent 38 cards, so he has 60 - 38 = 22 cards left.
3. **Calculate complete packages remaining:** Since each package has 12 cards, and he has 22 left, he has 22 / 12 = 1 full package remaining (with a remainder).
