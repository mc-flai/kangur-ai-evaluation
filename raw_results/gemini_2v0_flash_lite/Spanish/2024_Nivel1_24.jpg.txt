Razonamiento: We need to find the maximum number of coins we can place in the 4x5 grid such that no four coins form a rectangle (i.e., no two rows and two columns have coins).

A possible solution is to fill the grid in a pattern where no two rows have more than two coins in the same columns. We can try to fill the grid strategically.
One approach is to put coins in the following positions:
Row 1: Coins in columns 1, 2, 3
Row 2: Coins in columns 1, 4, 5
Row 3: Coins in columns 2, 3, 4
Row 4: Coins in columns 3, 4, 5

This way no four coins form a rectangle. The number of coins in this setup is 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12.

Another possible solution is by using the pattern:
X . X . X
. X . X .
X . X . X
. X . X .

In this case, the count will be 10. However, by filling the grid we can determine the maximum amount which is 12.

Respuesta: E) 12
