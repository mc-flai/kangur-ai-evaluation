Razonamiento:
1.  **Calculate lengths:** The segment TE has a length of 12 cm. Calculate the length of TA, TR and AI.
    *   TA = (1/4) * TE = (1/4) * 12 cm = 3 cm
    *   TR = (7/8) * TE = (7/8) * 12 cm = 10.5 cm
    *   AI = (1/2) * TE = (1/2) * 12 cm = 6 cm
2.  **Position the points:** Place the points on a line according to their distance from point T (one endpoint of the segment).  T is at the beginning.
    *   A is at 3 cm from T.
    *   R is at 10.5 cm from T.
    *   I is at 6 cm from T.
3.  **Order the points:** Sort the points in increasing order from T. This yields: T, A, I, R, E
