Razonamiento: The problem asks for the maximum possible difference between the two-digit numbers BD and AC, given that A < B < C < D. To maximize the difference (BD - AC), we need to maximize BD and minimize AC.

To maximize BD, D should be as large as possible and B should be as large as possible too. The largest possible value for D is 9. Then the largest possible value for C would be 8, the largest possible value for B would be 7 and so, the smallest possible value for A must be 6. Therefore BD = 79 and AC = 68.

To calculate the difference: 79 - 68 = 11, which is not included in the options. Let's try another approach.
If D=9, and C=8, so we have 79.
Then we have BD=79. Now we have to find the smallest posible value of AC,
If we take A as the smallest posible value for A being 1, then the value for B should be 2, and AC = 12
Then difference = 79-12 = 67

We want to make the maximum of BD, where D must be as big as possible and B must be as big as possible too.

If we try D=9, C=8, B=7, A=6:
BD = 79
AC = 68
Difference = 79-68 = 11

Now we will choose values so the difference is maximized:

Let us analyze the alternatives:
A) 86, means that if BD is 9x and AC is 0x or 1x
B) 61, means that if BD is 7x and AC is 1x
C) 56, means that if BD is 9x and AC is 3x
D) 50, means that if BD is 9x and AC is 4x
E) 16

Then, let's choose D as high as possible, so it is 9, C is 8, B=7, A=1, so
BD = 79
AC = 18
The difference = 61.
Other example: D=9, C=8, B=6, A=1
BD=69
AC=18
Difference = 51

If D=9
If B=8
C=7
A = 6
BD=89
AC=67
Difference = 22
If B=7
C=8
A = 6
BD = 79
AC = 68
Difference= 11
If B=7
C=8
A = 1
BD = 79
AC = 18
Difference = 61
We need a bigger number.

So D is 9
B is the biggest number before 9
B = 7
C = 8
A = 1
79 - 18= 61.
D=9
C=8
B=6
A=1
BD = 69
AC = 18
69-18=51

D=9
C=8
B=7
A=6
BD=79
AC=68
Difference = 11

Then it must be B.

Respuesta: B)
