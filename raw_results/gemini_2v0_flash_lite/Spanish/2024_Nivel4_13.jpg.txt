Razonamiento: The two triangles A and B are formed by the diagonals of the square. The area of a triangle is 1/2 * base * height. The base and the height of both triangles A and B are the same, and the triangles are located in a square, so the sides of the square act as the base and the height. Both triangles are the same, which means their areas are the same.  Therefore, A-B = 0.
