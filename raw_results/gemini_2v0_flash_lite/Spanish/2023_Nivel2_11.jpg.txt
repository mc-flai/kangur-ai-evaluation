Razonamiento:
1.  **Media de los primeros dos n√∫meros es un entero:** This is the key condition to start with. We must find a pair of numbers from the given set {4, 5, 8, 10, 13} such that their average is an integer.
2.  **Testing pairs:**
    *   4+5 = 9; 9/2 = 4.5 (Not an integer)
    *   4+8 = 12; 12/2 = 6 (Integer, possible first two numbers)
    *   4+10 = 14; 14/2 = 7 (Integer, possible first two numbers)
    *   4+13 = 17; 17/2 = 8.5 (Not an integer)
    *   5+8 = 13; 13/2 = 6.5 (Not an integer)
    *   5+10 = 15; 15/2 = 7.5 (Not an integer)
    *   5+13 = 18; 18/2 = 9 (Integer, possible first two numbers)
    *   8+10 = 18; 18/2 = 9 (Integer, possible first two numbers)
    *   8+13 = 21; 21/2 = 10.5 (Not an integer)
    *   10+13 = 23; 23/2 = 11.5 (Not an integer)
3.  **Possible starting sequences:**
    *   4, 8...
    *   4, 10...
    *   5, 13...
    *   8, 10...
4.  **Media de los primeros tres es un entero:**  We need the average of the first three numbers to be an integer, too.
    *   If we have 4, 8, then the third number must allow the mean of three numbers to be an integer. The available options are 5, 10, 13. If the third number is 5: (4+8+5)/3 = 17/3. If the third number is 10: (4+8+10)/3 = 22/3. If the third number is 13: (4+8+13)/3 = 25/3
    *   If we have 4, 10, then the third number must allow the mean of three numbers to be an integer. The available options are 5, 8, 13. If the third number is 5: (4+10+5)/3 = 19/3. If the third number is 8: (4+10+8)/3 = 22/3. If the third number is 13: (4+10+13)/3 = 27/3 = 9 (This works!)
    *   If we have 5, 13, then the third number must allow the mean of three numbers to be an integer. The available options are 4, 8, 10. If the third number is 4: (5+13+4)/3 = 22/3. If the third number is 8: (5+13+8)/3 = 26/3. If the third number is 10: (5+13+10)/3 = 28/3
    *   If we have 8, 10, then the third number must allow the mean of three numbers to be an integer. The available options are 4, 5, 13. If the third number is 4: (8+10+4)/3 = 22/3. If the third number is 5: (8+10+5)/3 = 23/3. If the third number is 13: (8+10+13)/3 = 31/3
5.  **The sequence with the integer mean of three numbers is:** 4, 10, 13
6.  **Media de los primeros cuatro es un entero:** Now, the average of the first four numbers is an integer. The remaining available numbers are 5 and 8. The sum of the first three number in the sequence is 4 + 10 + 13 = 27.
    *   If we put 5 in the sequence 4, 10, 13, 5 then (4+10+13+5)/4 = 32/4 = 8 (This Works!)
    *   If we put 8 in the sequence 4, 10, 13, 8 then (4+10+13+8)/4 = 35/4 (Doesn't work)
7. **The sequence is**: 4, 10, 13, 5
8.  The fifth number is the only one that's not in the initial sequence.
    The remaining number is 8
