Reasoning:
1.  **Analyze the given constraints:** The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 must be used. Symbols < and > indicate the order of the numbers. Each row and column must contain each number only once.
2.  **Fill in the grid:** The central number is 3. The numbers must be arranged so that < and > are correct.
3.  **Deduce the missing number for the grey circle:** The number next to the 3 is larger than the number in grey, and we can work out that the missing number must be a 1.
