Here's the breakdown of the problem and the answer:

*   **Understanding the Geometry:** We are dealing with a rectangle and several triangles within it. We know B is the midpoint of AD, and C is the midpoint of BD. This means that AB = BD/2, and BC = BD/4, and CD=BD/4.

*   **Area of Triangle AMN**: The area of AMN can be seen as one half times the area of the rectangle (since M and N are corners of the rectangle and the base of the triangle MN coincides with the base of the rectangle).

*   **Areas of Triangles BMN, CMN, and DMN:** We can determine the base for each triangle.
    *   BMN has base MN, and its height is AB, the height of the rectangle ADNM divided by 2. So its area is 1/4 the area of the rectangle.
    *   CMN has base MN and a height of BC = BD/4. Therefore, its area is (1/4) x (height of rectangle) / 2 = (1/8) the area of the rectangle.
    *   DMN has base MN and height AD. So its area is (1/2) x (height of rectangle) x 1/2= (1/4) the area of the rectangle.

*   **Comparing the Areas:** Comparing the four triangles:
    *   AMN has area 1/2 of the area of the rectangle
    *   BMN has area 1/4 the area of the rectangle.
    *   CMN has area 1/8 the area of the rectangle.
    *   DMN has area 1/4 the area of the rectangle.

*   **Finding the Smallest Area:** CMN has the smallest area.

    Razonamiento: Se analizan las áreas de cada triángulo en relación con el rectángulo original, determinando la base y altura de cada uno. Se compara las áreas resultantes.
    Respuesta: C) CMN
