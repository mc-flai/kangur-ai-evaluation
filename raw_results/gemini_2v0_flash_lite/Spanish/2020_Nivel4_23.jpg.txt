Razonamiento:
The problem states that we have a set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 14, 15}.
We are looking for subsets K = {a, b, c} such that b = (a + c) / 2.  This means that a + c must be even, implying that both a and c are even or both a and c are odd. Also a,b,c must be different elements.
Let's consider the case where a and c are both even:
The even numbers in S are {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14}. There are 7 even numbers. We need to pick 2 of them for a and c. The number of ways to select these two even numbers is 7C2 = 7! / (2! * 5!) = (7*6) / 2 = 21.  For each pair, there will be an associated value for b, and since all the elements in K need to be different, each choice of a and c, implies b has to be an integer, and the only way to ensure that will happen if we use a pair of even numbers or odd numbers to ensure the condition is met.

Let's consider the case where a and c are both odd:
The odd numbers in S are {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}. There are 8 odd numbers. We need to pick 2 of them for a and c. The number of ways to select these two odd numbers is 8C2 = 8! / (2! * 6!) = (8*7) / 2 = 28.
Thus the total number of such subsets K is the sum of the ways in the even and odd case, this means 21 + 28 = 49.
