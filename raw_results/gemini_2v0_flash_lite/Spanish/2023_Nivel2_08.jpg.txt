Razonamiento:
1. **Identify the products and the potential factors**: The problem states that the product of adjacent pairs of numbers is given. We have products of 30, 15, 42, and 28.
2. **Find the factors**:
    *   For the first two boxes: Since the product is 30 and the product of the middle boxes is 15, we can assume the middle box to be common. The factors of 30 are (1, 30), (2, 15), (3, 10), (5, 6). The factors of 15 are (1, 15), (3, 5).
    *   For the next two boxes: We have 15 and 42, and 42 and 28 as the products. The common number would be the one next to 15 and 28 in the image. The factors of 42 are (1, 42), (2, 21), (3, 14), (6, 7).  The factors of 28 are (1, 28), (2, 14), (4, 7).
3. **Populate the Boxes:**
    *   We notice that 15 and 42 have a common factor of 3, thus the boxes would contain the factors of 30: 6, 5 and factors of 15: 5, 3 and factors of 42: 3, 14 and finally factors of 28: 14, 2.
    * The boxes, from left to right, will hold the following numbers: 6, 5, 3, 14, 2.
4. **Calculate the sum**: 6 + 5 + 3 + 14 + 2 = 30
