Razonamiento:
The question asks to calculate how many different caterpillar arrangements can be made, given a head, a tail, and 1, 2, or 3 pieces in the middle.

There are two possible heads, and two possible tails.
There are 5 pieces that can be placed in the middle.

Let's calculate the possibilities:

1 piece in the middle:
*   Head - 1 piece - Tail: 2 * 5 * 2 = 20
2 pieces in the middle:
*   Head - 2 pieces - Tail: 2 * (5 * 4) / 2 * 2 = 40
3 pieces in the middle:
*   Head - 3 pieces - Tail: 2 * (5 * 4 * 3) / (3 * 2 * 1) * 2 = 40
Total possibilities = 20

However, the question gives us a choice. There are two head pieces, and two tail pieces. Let's analyze further the combinations:

*   **1 piece in the middle**: 2 (heads) * 5 (middle pieces) * 2 (tails) = 20
*   **2 pieces in the middle**: 2 (heads) * (5 choose 2) * 2 (tails) = 2 * 10 * 2 = 40
*   **3 pieces in the middle**: 2 (heads) * (5 choose 3) * 2 (tails) = 2 * 10 * 2 = 40

Now the prompt says "una, dos, o tres piezas" so the combinations are:

1 piece: 2 * 5 * 2 = 20
2 pieces: 2 * (5*4/2) * 2 = 40
3 pieces: 2 * (5*4*3/6) * 2 = 40

Since the options don't have the sum of the possible combinations, that means that the pieces in the middle are not unique to each piece.

Thus, there are two heads and two tails. Let's break this down.

*   **1 Piece**: There are 5 options, times 2 heads, times 2 tails = 20
*   **2 Pieces**: This would be more complex to arrange without considering the order. However, we know the answer is one of the given options. The number of possibilities *should* be higher than 14.
*   **3 Pieces**: Would also lead to an even higher number.

Let's reconsider the question. If we consider the arrangement of the middle pieces to not matter, it would seem like 1 piece could be: 2 Heads * 5 middles * 2 Tails = 20 possibilities. This seems to be a viable answer.

If we were to consider the order of 2 pieces:  2*5*4/2 *2 = 40, and order of three pieces 2*5*4*3/6 * 2 =40, and adding the cases. 20 + 40 + 40 is not given

Let's consider the total number of possibilities (combinations) with no regard to the middle pieces' order, given that they are not unique:

We are given 7 different puzzle pieces. We have to select 1 head, 1 tail, and 1, 2, or 3 pieces. There are 2 heads to choose from. There are 2 tails to choose from.
*   **Case 1: 1 piece in the middle:**  2 heads * 5 pieces * 2 tails = 20
*   **Case 2: 2 pieces in the middle:**  2 heads * 5 pieces * 4 pieces / 2 * 2 tails = 40
*   **Case 3: 3 pieces in the middle:**  2 heads * 5 pieces * 4 pieces * 3 pieces / 6 * 2 tails = 40
The sum is NOT one of the choices. However, the question asks for different caterpillars. Since the order is important in the puzzle and not stated, consider the distinct cases.

Let's consider the combination: head, one middle, tail.
There are 2 head options and 2 tail options. The 5 middle pieces have 5 options.
2 * 5 * 2 = 20

The answer is thus probably 20.
