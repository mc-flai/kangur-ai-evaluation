Razonamiento:
1. **Total squares:** The grid is 3x6, which means there are 3 * 6 = 18 squares.
2. **Blue squares:** One-third of the squares are blue: 18 / 3 = 6 blue squares.
3. **Yellow squares:** Half of the squares are yellow: 18 / 2 = 9 yellow squares.
4. **Red squares:** The rest are red. Calculate the number of red squares by subtracting the blue and yellow squares from the total: 18 (total) - 6 (blue) - 9 (yellow) = 3 red squares.
