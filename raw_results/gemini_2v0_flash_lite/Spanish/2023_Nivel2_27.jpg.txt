Razonamiento: The sum of 2023 consecutive integers is 2023. The median number will be the average, 2023/2023 = 1. Since there are an odd number of integers, the median number will be the middle integer. Thus, the series is centered around 1. The series will have a lower bound and an upper bound with 1 in the middle. Since there are 2023 integers, there will be (2023-1)/2 = 1011 integers below 1 and 1011 integers above 1. Thus, the smallest integer will be 1 - 1011 = -1010. The sum of the digits of -1010 (we take the absolute value) is 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2.
