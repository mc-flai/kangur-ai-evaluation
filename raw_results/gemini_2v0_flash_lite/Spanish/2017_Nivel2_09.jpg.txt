Here's the breakdown of the problem and the solution:

*   **Let 'x' be the number of apples picked.**
*   I ate one apple, so I have x - 1 apples now.
*   If I had picked double the amount, I would have 2x apples.
*   The problem states 2x is 14 more than what I have now, which is x - 1.
*   So the equation is: 2x = (x - 1) + 14
*   Simplify the equation: 2x = x + 13
*   Solve for x: x = 13

Reasoning: The question describes a word problem that can be solved with a simple algebraic equation. Translating the worded information into an equation is the key to finding the right answer.

Answer: B) 13
