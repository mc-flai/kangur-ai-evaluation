Razonamiento: The question asks which of the given figures can be constructed using 9 identical bars. Each bar has 3 cubes, 1 white and 2 grey. I will analyze the options and see how we can combine the bars to form the structures. The key is to have one white cube and two grey cubes connected with each other. We need to look at the white and grey cubes. Since the starting figure shows the white cube in the middle, so the white cube should be in the middle of the bar.

Option A:  This is a valid configuration.
Option B:  This is a valid configuration.
Option C: This is a valid configuration.
Option D: This is a valid configuration.
Option E: This is a valid configuration.

We need to analyze the configuration of bars and their orientation.

All of the options can be constructed with the bars.

Respuesta: A)
