Razonamiento: The question defines a "pleasant" three-digit number as one where the middle digit is greater than the sum of the other two digits. We need to find the maximum number of consecutive "pleasant" numbers.
Let's analyze:
*   If the first digit is 1, and the second digit is 2, the last digit can be 0 or 1.
*   The consecutive pleasant numbers can start with 100 (not pleasant), then we must find the numbers that satisfy the given conditions.

*   Consider the hundreds digit as 'a', the tens digit as 'b' and the units digit as 'c'.
*   The condition is b > a + c.
*   Let's find consecutive numbers.
    *   100: Not pleasant.
    *   110: Not pleasant.
    *   120: 2 > 1+0, pleasant.
    *   121: 2 > 1+1, pleasant.
    *   122: Not pleasant
*   Considering the numbers starting with 1, we can get 120, 121. That's two.
*   If we start with 2.
    *   200: Not pleasant.
    *   210: Not pleasant.
    *   220: Not pleasant.
    *   230: 3 > 2+0, pleasant.
    *   231: 3 > 2+1, pleasant.
    *   240: 4 > 2+0, pleasant.
    *   241: 4 > 2+1, pleasant.
    *   242: 4 > 2+2, pleasant.
    *   250: 5 > 2+0, pleasant.
    *   251: 5 > 2+1, pleasant.
    *   252: 5 > 2+2, pleasant.
    *   260: 6 > 2+0, pleasant.
    *   261: 6 > 2+1, pleasant.
    *   262: 6 > 2+2, pleasant.
    *   263: 6 > 2+3, pleasant.
    *   270, 271, 272, 273, 274. 5 consecutive pleasant numbers.

*   If we try another starting number such as 3.
    *   300: Not pleasant.
    *   310: Not pleasant.
    *   320, 321, 322.
    *   330, 331, 332, 333.
    *   So the amount of consecutive pleasant numbers can be more than 5, 6, 7.

*Let's look for more options:*
*We need to maximize.*
Let's start with 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, (9 > 1+8), 190: not pleasant
200: Not pleasant.
210: Not pleasant.
220: Not pleasant.
230, 231.
So we have 200, 201...
We can get the sequence 120, 121, 130, 131, 132, 140, 141, 142, 143... so, 7 numbers are possible.

Let's look for 8 consecutive pleasant numbers:

7 numbers are possible.
120, 121.
200, 230, 231, 240, 241, 242. 6
250, 251, 252. 3
260, 261, 262, 263. 4.
The total could be 8.

Trying consecutive numbers:
120, 121, 130, 131, 132, 140, 141, 142.
