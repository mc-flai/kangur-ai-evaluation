Razonamiento:
1. **Define the variables:** Let 'x' be the total capacity of the jar in liters.
2. **Translate the problem into an equation:**
   - Initially, the jar is half-full: x/2 liters.
   - Then, 2 liters are added: x/2 + 2 liters.
   - After adding the water, the jar is three-quarters full: (3/4)x liters.
   - Therefore: x/2 + 2 = (3/4)x
3. **Solve the equation for x:**
   - Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate fractions: 2x + 8 = 3x
   - Subtract 2x from both sides: 8 = x
4. **Solution** The capacity of the jar is 8 liters.
