Razonamiento: We need to count the number of different paths from vertex A to vertex B, following the arrows in the figure. From A, there are three possible paths to the next level. Each of those has two possible paths to the next level. Those second level vertices each have one final arrow going to vertex B. Therefore, the total number of paths is 3 * 2 = 6.

Respuesta: C)
