Razonamiento: Let's denote the distance traveled each day as follows: Monday = x, Tuesday = x + 2, Wednesday = x + 4, Thursday = x + 6, Friday = x + 8. The total distance is the sum of these distances, which equals 70 km:  x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 70.  Simplifying: 5x + 20 = 70, so 5x = 50, and x = 10. Therefore, on Monday, Pedro traveled 10 km, Tuesday 12 km, Wednesday 14 km, Thursday 16 km, and Friday 18 km.  The question asks for the distance traveled on Thursday, which is x + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 km.
