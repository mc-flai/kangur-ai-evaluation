Razonamiento: We need to determine the number of ways two frogs can jump to an adjacent empty cell, maintaining two frogs per row and column.  Let's analyze the possible moves:

*   Frogs in the top row: The frog can jump down to the empty middle cell. Similarly, the frog on the right top can jump to the middle right cell.
*   Frogs in the middle row: The frog in the middle can jump to the top middle cell. The frog on the right can jump to the bottom right cell.
*   Frogs in the bottom row: The frog on the left can jump to the middle right cell. The frog on the right can jump to the bottom middle cell.
* Frogs in the right column: The frog on the right top can jump to the right middle cell. The frog on the right middle can jump to the right bottom cell.

Let's enumerate the moves:

1.  Top row: frog moves to the middle cell
2.  Top row: frog moves to the top right.
3.  Middle row: middle frog moves to the top middle cell.
4.  Middle row: right frog to bottom right cell
5.  Bottom row: frog jumps to right cell
6.  Right column: top frog jumps to the right middle cell.
7. Right column: middle frog jumps to the bottom right cell.

There are 4 distinct ways:
1. Top row frogs jump
2. Bottom row frogs jump
3. Middle row frogs jump
4. Frogs in the right column jump

Response: D) 4
