Razonamiento: The question asks for the minimum number of colors needed to color the lines of a metro map such that lines sharing a station have different colors. This is a classic graph coloring problem. I need to identify the maximum number of lines intersecting at a single station to determine the minimum colors. By inspecting the diagram, I found that there are multiple stations where four lines intersect (specifically, the stations labeled '4', '5', and '6', '7' are involved in four lines intersecting each other). No station has more than four lines converging on it, thus the minimum number of colors needed must be four.

Respuesta: B) 4
