Razonamiento: We are given that the sum of the numbers in each circle is 10. Let's analyze each circle. The first circle has a 6 and another card. The fourth circle has a 3 and another card. Let's look at the second and third circles. The second circle has a 6 and two other cards and we need to find what number is under the question mark. The fourth circle has a 3 and two other cards.
*   Circle 1: 6 + ? = 10; The other number has to be 4.
*   Circle 4: 3 + ? = 10; The other number has to be 7.
*   So we have used 3, 6, 4, and 7. We have to place the other numbers.
*   Looking at the possible answers, only 4 is available, so the unknown card must be 4.
*   Circle 3: ? + ? = 10, the question mark cannot be 4.
*   We have to find the other numbers to be placed. Numbers remaining are 1, 2, and 5.
*   The second circle has 6 and 1 more card, The sum is 10. 6+?+?=10.
*   The third circle needs to have 2 cards adding up to 10.
*   So, let's try the solution C) 4 for the question mark, then, based on the question, number under the question mark is 4.
*   Circle 2: 6 + ? + ? = 10, this cannot be right since number 4 is used.
*   Circle 3 : 4, let's suppose this could be 1 + 5, that would be the only solution if 4 would be correct.
*   Circle 2: 6 + 1 + ? = 10
*   Circle 4: 3 + 5 + ? = 10

    If the unknown number is 4, then the third ring has the numbers 4, and other numbers that add up to 10, 4+?=10 which makes a total of 6, let us use for the numbers 1, 2, 5, 7.

    Let's place the other numbers:
*   The second circle has 6 and 1 more card, 6 + 1+ 2 = 10 (it uses 2)
*   The third circle must have 4 and 1 more card, 4+5=10 (it uses 5).
*   The fourth circle has 3 and 2 cards, 3+5+2=10.
*   Then 6 + 2 + 1 = 10.
*   4 + 5 = 9, 3 + 2 = 5.
*   4 should be under the "?"
*   Circle 2 6+1+3=10
*   Circle 3 4+2+3=9
*   Circle 4 3+7=10
So we have 6, 1, 3 and 4,2, 7 and 5
Circle 3, should be 4, 2 or 5, the only one available is 4
Therefore:
*   Circle 1: 6 + ? = 10; other number has to be 4.
*   Circle 4: 3 + ? = 10; other number has to be 7.

    Then 6, 3, 4, and 7 can be in each circle.

    6 + ? + ? = 10
    3+ ? + ?=10.

    Other numbers 1, 2, 5, 3
    So the number must be 4.

    6+1+3=10.
    1+2+4=10
    5+3+2=10

    Remaining 1,2, 5
    So ?, the sum has to be 10
*   6 + ? + ? = 10, numbers 1, 2, 5 (6+1+?=10)
*   ?+?=10
*   3+? = 10, 7?
*   6+1+3=10
*   ?+2+4=10

*   Numbers given are 1 to 7
    The number is 2 is not used.
    If 4 is missing, then this should be placed
    6+1+3=10
    4+5+1=10
    3+7=10
    So we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    ? must be 2
    So we have 6 + 1+ 3=10
    4+2+?
    3+7+?=10

    So the question mark is 5.

    Let's analyze
    The number in "?" can be 5
    6+1+3=10
    4+2+5
    3+7
    the answer is 5.
    Answer is D) 5.

Razonamiento: The sum of the numbers in each circle is 10.

*   The first circle has 6 and one card
*   The last circle has 3 and 2 cards.
*   The numbers must be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
*   Circle 1 must have 6.
*   Circle 4 must have 3.
*   If the number is 1 in the second circle, then 6+1+3, if it contains 3.
*   Numbers 1, 2, 5, 7 remain
*   If it contains the number 5, the third circle would have 2.
*   If it contains the number 2, the third circle should have 4.
*   So 2,4,5

*   The missing numbers are 1, 2, 4, 5, 7.
*   If ? is 5 the remaining numbers in the third circle should add up to 5.

    ? can only be 2.

    Therefore: 5 must be under the "?" mark.

Respuesta: D) 5
