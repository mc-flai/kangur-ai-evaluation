Razonamiento:
1. **Analyze the figures**: Visually compare the lengths of the lines a, b, and c.
2. **Estimate lengths**:
    *   *a*: a is the shortest. Counting the grid squares, we can see that a has 6 lines
    *   *b*: b is the longest. b has 10 lines.
    *   *c*: c is longer than *a* but shorter than *b*. c has 7 lines.
3.  **Order the lengths**: Based on the estimation, the order from shortest to longest is: a < c < b.
4.  **Match with the options**: Find the option that corresponds to the order a < c < b.

Respuesta: B)
