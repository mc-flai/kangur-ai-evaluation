Razonamiento: Primero, Sara comes 1/9 of the pizza, leaving 1 - 1/9 = 8/9 of the pizza. Then, Manuel eats 3/8 of the remaining pizza, which is (3/8)*(8/9) = 24/72 = 1/3. Thus, Manuel eats 1/3 of the pizza.  Together, Sara and Manuel ate 1/9 + 1/3 = 1/9 + 3/9 = 4/9 of the pizza. The fraction that has been left is 1 - 4/9 = 5/9.
