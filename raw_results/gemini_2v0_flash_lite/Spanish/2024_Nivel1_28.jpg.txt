Razonamiento: We need to determine which net cannot be folded into the cube shown. The cube has a red triangle at the corner. Analyzing the nets, we can see the location of the red triangles to determine the net that would not be a valid fold.
A: This is a possible net for the cube.
B: This is a possible net for the cube.
C: This is a possible net for the cube.
D: This is a possible net for the cube.
E:  This is a possible net for the cube.

The question asks for the *incorrect* net. Let's focus on the orientations of the red triangles. The given cube has the red triangles touching.
Looking at the options, if we imagine folding each net into a cube, we can see that net E would have the red triangles separated, and not touching.

Respuesta: E)
