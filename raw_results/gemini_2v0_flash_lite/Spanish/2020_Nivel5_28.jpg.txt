Razonamiento: The problem states that in each combat, two people fight, and the third rests. After each combat, the winner fights the person who rested. We know that Alicia fought 10 times, Blanca fought 15, and Carla fought 17. Since two people fight in each combat, the total number of fights must be even.
Alicia fought 10 times.
Blanca fought 15 times.
Carla fought 17 times.
The sum of all combats is not the same since there is always a person who is resting.
If we analyze the number of combats made by each person in the event, we notice that two people are fighting and one is resting. We are asked who lost the second fight. We know that:
- Alicia fought 10 combats
- Blanca fought 15 combats
- Carla fought 17 combats
Since there is always a third person resting, the total number of combats is unknown. However, we can infer that the winner of the first combat must have fought the person resting in the first combat. The winner of that combat must have fought again.
We can see that the person who fought the fewest times must have rested the most. This is Alicia. The person who fought the most must have had the most matches. This is Carla. We cannot know who lost the second fight, because the winning person is always in the next fight. It could be Blanca or Carla.
However, considering the question, and the structure of the matches, we can calculate that the total number of rounds is such that two people compete. The next fight is between the winner and the one who rested, so the number of fights that Alicia fought is 10, Bianca 15 and Carla 17.

If Alicia fought 10 times, Blanca fought 15 and Carla 17, this means that Alicia was the one who rested the most and must have lost the second fight, this is because the winner of any fight in this competition will fight in the next fight, therefore, whoever fights less, loses more. This is the case of Alicia who fought 10 times in total.
