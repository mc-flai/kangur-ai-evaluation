Razonamiento: To find the minimum percentage of students who answered all three questions correctly, we need to find the intersection of the percentages for each question. We multiply the percentages of students who answered each question correctly: 90% * 80% * 70% = 0.9 * 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.504, or 50.4%. Since we are looking for the *minimum* percentage, we need to find the whole number closest to the calculated percentage, which is 50%.
