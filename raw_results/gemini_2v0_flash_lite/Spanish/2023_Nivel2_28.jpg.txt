Here's my analysis of the question and the solution:

*   **Understanding the Problem:** The question describes a PIN with four unique digits. The sum of the digits is 8, and the product of the first two digits equals the two-digit number formed by the third and fourth digits. The question is to find how many such PIN codes exist.
*   **Finding the combinations:**
    *   Let's list possible combinations of the first two digits and their product.
    *   Digits must be unique and sum to 8 with digits 0-9
    *   Case 1: 1 and 2. 1 * 2 = 2. Remaining digits must sum to 5. The digits could be (0,5) or (3,2) but the 2 is already in the PIN. PIN code would be 1205.
    *   Case 2: 1 and 3. 1 \* 3 = 3. Remaining digits must sum to 4. Digits could be (0,4). PIN code would be 1304.
    *   Case 3: 1 and 4. 1 * 4 = 4. Remaining digits must sum to 3. Digits could be (0,3) PIN code would be 1403.
    *   Case 4: 2 and 3. 2 \* 3 = 6. Remaining digits must sum to 2. Digits could be (0,2) but 2 is already in PIN.
    *   The possible codes are 1205, 1304, and 1403. All digits are different, all digits sum to 8 and the product of the first two digits is equal to the last two digits.
*   **Conclusion:** There are 3 possible codes that meet the stated criteria.

    Razonamiento: Se analizan las condiciones dadas, se buscan combinaciones que cumplan con los requisitos de suma, producto y unicidad de d√≠gitos.
