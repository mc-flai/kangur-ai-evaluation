Razonamiento:
Let's denote the number of toys that Blanca, Carmen, and Ana brought as B, C, and A respectively. We have the following relationships:
*   A = B + 5
*   A = C + 9
*   B >= 1
*   C >= 1

We want to minimize A + B + C.
Since A = B + 5 and A = C + 9, we can write B = A - 5 and C = A - 9.
The total number of toys is A + B + C = A + (A - 5) + (A - 9) = 3A - 14.
To minimize the total, we need to find the smallest possible value for A.
Since B >= 1, then A - 5 >= 1, which means A >= 6.
Since C >= 1, then A - 9 >= 1, which means A >= 10.
Thus, the smallest possible value for A is 10. If A = 10, then B = 10 - 5 = 5 and C = 10 - 9 = 1.
In this case, A + B + C = 10 + 5 + 1 = 16.
Therefore, the minimum number of toys they brought is 16.
