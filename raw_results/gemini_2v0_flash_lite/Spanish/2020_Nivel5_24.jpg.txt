Razonamiento: The overlapping region is a parallelogram. The base of the parallelogram is 9cm and the height is 3 cm.  The area of the parallelogram is base x height, which is 9 cm x 3 cm = 27 sq cm. But the image is a trapezoid, not a parallelogram. The area of the trapezoid is the area where the 2 rectangles overlap. One rectangle is 3 x 9 = 27. The other is also 3 x 9 = 27. The overlapping area is a parallelogram. We can consider the overlapped shape as a parallelogram with base and height as 3cm and the diagonal of the parallelogram is unknown. However, the width of the overlap is the same length as the shortest side which is 3 cm. Therefore, we can consider it a parallelogram with sides 3cm and 9 cm. The area is 3x9 = 27/2 = 13.5.
