Razonamiento:
1. **Calculate pages read per week:** Carmen reads 3 pages from Monday to Friday (5 days), which is 3 * 5 = 15 pages. She reads 5 pages on Saturday and Sunday, which is 5 * 2 = 10 pages. So, Carmen reads 15 + 10 = 25 pages each week.
2. **Calculate complete weeks:** Divide the total number of pages (239) by the number of pages read per week (25): 239 / 25 = 9 with a remainder of 14. This means Carmen completes 9 full weeks and then reads a partial week.
3. **Determine the day the reading begins and ends for the complete weeks:** Since she starts on a Sunday, after 7 days, she will be reading a Sunday.
4. **Calculate the remaining pages and determine the day she will read the last page:** After 9 complete weeks (225 pages), she has 239 - 225 = 14 pages left. The partial week starts on a Sunday (the beginning).
   - Sunday: 5 pages (225+5 = 230 pages read)
   - Monday: 3 pages (230+3 = 233 pages read)
   - Tuesday: 3 pages (233+3 = 236 pages read)
   - Wednesday: 3 pages (236+3 = 239 pages read)
   - The last page will be read on Wednesday.
