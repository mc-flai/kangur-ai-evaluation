Reasoning:
1.  Approximate the square root of 21:  √21 is slightly more than √16 = 4, but less than √25 = 5.  We can approximate it as 4.5.
2.  Calculate the lower bound of the interval: 20 - √21 ≈ 20 - 4.5 = 15.5
3.  Calculate the upper bound of the interval: 20 + √21 ≈ 20 + 4.5 = 24.5
4.  Identify integers within the interval (15.5, 24.5).  The integers are 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24.
5.  Count the number of integers.  There are 9 integers.
