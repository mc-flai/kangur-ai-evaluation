Reasoning: The question is about assembling a 3x3x3 cube from 27 smaller cubes. Each small cube has three adjacent faces painted red. To maximize the number of completely red faces on the larger cube, we want to arrange the small cubes so that the red faces are outward. A 3x3x3 cube has 6 faces. We need to consider how many small cubes can contribute a completely red face to the larger cube. The maximum number of completely red faces on a 3x3x3 cube would be achieved by having all the small cubes with the painted faces oriented to show only the red faces.

1. **Corner Cubes:** A corner cube will have 3 red faces showing. To form a red face on the larger cube, place such a corner cube on the corner. There are 8 corners in the larger cube. But each of the small cubes has three painted faces.
2. **Edge Cubes:** Edge cubes contribute to one complete red face. There are 12 edges.
3. **Center face Cubes**: To make a red face, the answer would be 3x3 = 9 smaller cubes contribute to making a face in the bigger cube. To maximize the number of red faces, arrange the small cubes in such a way that a completely red face is formed. To achieve the maximum, aim for using only those cubes that contribute towards the red faces. Each corner cube has 3 painted faces. Each edge cube has 2 painted faces. Each face cube has 1 painted face. The core cube will not have a red face as per the conditions. So consider having each smaller cube in such a way that it shows one of the 3 adjacent red faces. The cube can have a maximum of 6 completely red faces. However, in this case, we have only 27 such cubes. Therefore the maximum red faces that can be achieved is 6.
