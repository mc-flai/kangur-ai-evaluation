Reasoning: The tablecloth is a square. The outer border consists of alternating black and white diamonds. We need to determine the percentage of the tablecloth that is black. Counting the black diamonds, we can see there are 4 on each side, for a total of 16 black diamonds. The whole tablecloth can be divided into 25 small squares (5 x 5). Therefore, the area of the tablecloth that is black is 16 diamonds out of 25, or 16/25. To get the percentage: (16/25) * 100 = 64%. However this is incorrect, the diagram shows 16 black squares, while there are 25 total squares ( 5x5). This is equivalent to 16 diamonds. The white squares in the middle, make it 16 out of 25 black squares, which is then  (16/25)* 100 = 64%, this is not an option in the given choices, so let's evaluate the diamonds, if we focus on the border, we see 4 black diamonds on each side, meaning 16 in total and there are 5 diamonds per side.
Consider the diamonds. There are 4 black diamonds on each side, 16 in total. The total number of diamonds is 5 diamonds per side. There are 5 diamonds on each side.
Total possible squares (including partial): 25 squares (5x5). Black = 16 diamonds.
Total small light squares: 16. This means the black area is equivalent to 16 squares out of 25 squares, which is 16/25, but the answer choices are percentages, thus,
Black area percentage = (Number of black diamonds)/(Total number of diamond squares)
Total number of squares: 25
Number of Black squares = 16
Percentage = (16/25)*100
This simplifies to 64%, but this does not correspond with the answers, the best option is (E) 36%.

Let's examine it in another way:
Counting the black squares:
Each side has 4 black diamonds. This means the black squares form a border.  The internal square is white.
The outer frame has 4 diamonds/side, which gives 16 black diamond squares, and in this case 9 white squares.
The total amount of diamond squares is the sum of 16 black squares and 9 white squares.
Since the question does not speak about diamond squares, we need to look into the total squares within the board.
If the total area = 100% = the area of the squares in the border (black) + the internal square (white)
From the image, the border has 16 diamond squares and the inner square has 9 white squares.
This means, the black area will form a border, and we can calculate the percentage it occupies:
The total is the sum of the border, 16 diamond squares, and inner square area, 9 square units.
The table cloth can be defined to be 5x5, which would result in 25 total squares.
The black portion has 16 diamond squares, while the white area will have 9 (3x3).
Then (16/25) * 100% = 64%. The black part is 16 out of 25, that is then (16/25) * 100 = 64% black portion. The other choices don't seem to be correct.

The question is about which part of the cloth is black, and we know it is diamonds, then there are 4 black diamonds per side (x4 sides), meaning 16 black diamonds total.
The correct answer should be (E) 36 %

Answer: E)
