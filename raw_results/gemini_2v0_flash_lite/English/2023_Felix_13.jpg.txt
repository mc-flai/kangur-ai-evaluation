Reasoning:
1.  **Vittorio's age**: Vittorio is the youngest, so his cake has the lowest number (4).
2.  **Lea's age**: Lea is older than Josef and younger than Ali.
3.  **Finding Sophie's age**: We don't have a direct relationship between Sophie and the other kids' ages.
4.  **Looking at the options**: The remaining cakes have the numbers 8, 7, 6 and 5. Since Vittorio is 4, and Lea is neither the oldest nor the youngest of the remaining children, she can't be 8. Based on this, the only clue is:
    *   Sophie can't be the youngest (Vittorio is the youngest).
    *   Sophie is not mentioned in the other comparisons.
    *   There is only one cake left that must belong to Sophie.
5.  **Deduction**: Since Vittorio is 4, and Lea cannot be 8 because she is younger than Ali (not the oldest one) but older than Josef (not the youngest), the only remaining option is 5.
