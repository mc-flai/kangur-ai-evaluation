Reasoning:
1. The bottle is half full, meaning it contains 0.5 liters of syrup.
2. The juice is made by diluting syrup in a 1:7 ratio, meaning for every 1 part syrup, there are 7 parts of water.  This means that juice is (1+7) = 8 parts.  So 1/8 of the juice comes from syrup.
3. To get 2 liters of juice, the syrup required will be (1/8) * 2 liters = 0.25 liters
4. The fraction of the original syrup needed is therefore 0.25 liters / 0.5 liters = 1/2.

Answer: B)
