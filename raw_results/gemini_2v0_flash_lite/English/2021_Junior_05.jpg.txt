Reasoning:
1.  **Halftime Score:** The score at halftime was 9:14 (home:visiting).
2.  **Second Half Scoring:** The home team scored twice as many goals as the visiting team in the second half.
3.  **Final Score:** The home team won by one goal.
4.  **Calculate Second Half Scores:** Let 'x' be the number of goals scored by the visiting team in the second half. The home team scored 2x goals.
5.  **Set up Equations:**
    *   Home Team's Total: 9 + 2x
    *   Visiting Team's Total: 14 + x
    *   Winning Score Difference: (9 + 2x) - (14 + x) = 1
6.  **Solve for x:**
    *   2x - x = 1 + 14 - 9
    *   x = 6
7.  **Find the Final Score:**
    *   Home: 9 + 2(6) = 9 + 12 = 21
    *   Visiting: 14 + 6 = 20
8. The final score is 21:20.
