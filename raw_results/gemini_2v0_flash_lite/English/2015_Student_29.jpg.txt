Reasoning: The problem describes a process where members are eliminated based on whether they say an even number. We need to determine the number the last remaining member said in the first round. This is a variation of the Josephus problem. After the first round, all even numbers are eliminated, leaving 48 people. The smallest number the last person could say is 1. The second round starts with 97 and the eliminated will say the even numbers: 98, 100, 102.... After round 1 the odd numbers remain and if the process continues the person that says 1 will be the winner.
