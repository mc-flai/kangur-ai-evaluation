Reasoning: The volume of a cuboid is given by the product of its three dimensions (a * b * c).  We are given that a < b < c. If each dimension is increased by 5 cm, then:
- If a increases by 5: The new volume is (a+5)bc = abc + 5bc. The increase is 5bc.
- If b increases by 5: The new volume is a(b+5)c = abc + 5ac. The increase is 5ac.
- If c increases by 5: The new volume is ab(c+5) = abc + 5ab. The increase is 5ab.

Since a < b < c, then ab < ac < bc. Therefore, increasing 'a' yields the largest increase in volume (5bc).

Answer: A)
