Reasoning: The image shows the white and black components of a 3D shape, which is made of 18 cubes and is colored with three different colors. We have to find the grey part. By observing the assembled shape, the grey part is the only remaining part. This means we need to combine the white and black components to figure out which of the available options corresponds to the grey part. The 3D structure is a layer of 6x1 blocks plus a 2x2 block on top that is partially shifted. Options (A), (B), (C), and (E) do not fit the general structure of the object. (D) has the right structure and also the correct grey color.

Answer: D)
