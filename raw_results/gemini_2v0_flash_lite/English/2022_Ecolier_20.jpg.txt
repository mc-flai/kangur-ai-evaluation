Reasoning: We need to find combinations of hexagons that allow travel from A to B and A to E but block the path from B to D.  Let's consider the provided options.
*   A to B: Requires a path connecting A and B. A path from E to B can't exist if we can't get to D.
*   A to E: Requires a path connecting A and E. The paths from A and E must not cross the path to D.
*   Not D: No connection from B to D.

Let's analyze the hexagon options:
*   Hexagon 1 allows A to B and A to E and does not create a direct path from D to B. This satisfies the conditions.
*   Hexagon 2 allows travel from A to B, but doesn't connect to E.
*   Hexagon 3 only has a path connecting three sides.
*   Hexagon 4 allows a path from A to B and A to E, but would create a path to D.
*   Hexagon 5 would let A to B, but can't reach E

Based on the analysis, hexagon 1 enables the required paths (A to B, A to E) without creating a connection to D. Thus, combining hexagon 1 with a suitable other hexagon is required. Looking at the options, Hexagon 4 also allows for a path from A to B and does not create a direct connection to D.

Therefore, hexagons 1 and 4 are the correct match.
