Reasoning: We are given the number of each type of ice cream and toppings and must determine which combination is possible, given the constraint that no two ice creams should be identical.
*   There is only one mango ice cream.
*   The question asks for the possible combination of ice cream and topping.
*   Option (B) Mango and Cherry is a valid combination as there is only one mango ice cream and three cherries.
*   Option (D) Mango and wafer is a valid combination as there is only one mango ice cream and only two wafers.
*   Option (E) Lemon and cherry is a valid combination, as there are two lemon ice creams, so one lemon ice cream can come with a cherry and one with another topping.

Answer: B)
