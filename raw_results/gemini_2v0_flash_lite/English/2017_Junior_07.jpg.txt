Reasoning: The circle has a radius of 1, and the distance from K to L is 11π.  The circumference of the circle is 2πr = 2π(1) = 2π.  This means that the circle will rotate a total of (11π) / (2π) = 5.5 times.
After 5 full rotations, the circle would be in the same orientation as when it started.
However, there is an additional half rotation, which rotates the circle by 180 degrees from its starting position.

The starting position shows the black part touching the line. After the half rotation the white part will be touching the line.

Answer: B)
