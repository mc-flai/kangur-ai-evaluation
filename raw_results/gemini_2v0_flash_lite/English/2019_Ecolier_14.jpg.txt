Reasoning: To get the largest sum, we want the largest digits in the tens places (or hundreds). Thus, we want the two largest digits (9 and 2) to be the tens digits. To maximize the resulting sum, we want the larger of the two digits (9) to be in the tens position, making the result largest, the smaller number (2) to be in the second tens position. Thus, the remaining digits will have to be used for the single digit. The remaining digits are 0 and 1. Therefore, we need to use either 0 or 1 for the single digit number.

Answer: A)
