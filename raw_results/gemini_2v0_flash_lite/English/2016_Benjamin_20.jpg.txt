Reasoning:
Let 't' be the number of tables and 'c' be the number of chairs.
From the first condition, the number of chairs needed is 4t, and since he is 6 short, we have c = 4t - 6.
From the second condition, two tables form a table with 6 chairs, so he needs 6(t/2) chairs (assuming t is even).  He has 4 chairs left over, so c = 6(t/2) + 4 = 3t + 4.
Now we have two equations:
1) c = 4t - 6
2) c = 3t + 4
Equating the two equations: 4t - 6 = 3t + 4
Solving for t: t = 10.

Answer: B)
