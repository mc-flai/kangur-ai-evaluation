Reasoning:
1.  **Equal Numbers:** The problem states that after the transformations, there are an equal number of dogs, cats, and mice. Since there are 30 animals total, this means there are 30 / 3 = 10 of each animal type after the witch's changes.
2.  **Reverse the Changes:** We need to work backward to figure out the original number of cats.
    *   The witch changed 5 cats into mice, so before that, there were 10 cats + 5 cats = 15 cats.
    *   The witch changed 6 dogs into 6 cats. So before that change, there were 15 cats - 6 cats = 9 cats.
3.  **Original Number of Cats:** Therefore, there were 9 cats to start with.
