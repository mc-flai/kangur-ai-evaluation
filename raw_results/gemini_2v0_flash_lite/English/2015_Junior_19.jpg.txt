Reasoning: We need to find three-digit numbers where the digits differ by 3. Let's consider the possible digit pairs that have a difference of 3: (0,3), (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,8), (6,9).
Since the number is a three-digit number, the first digit cannot be 0. Let's consider cases:
*   If the first digit is 1, the second can be 4. The third digit can be anything as the rule is applied to digits beside each other. The next set of pairs are (1,4)
Possible numbers: 14x and 41x . Since 1st digit cannot be 0, so there are no numbers like 40x. The third digit can be anything, so the numbers can be : 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149 (10 numbers). 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419 (10 numbers). So here we have 2x10= 20 numbers
*   If the first digit is 2, the second can be 5. Possible numbers: 252, 25x and 52x with each digit differing by 3. 252, 525. Third digit can vary as we get 25x and 52x. The digits must always differ by 3. Then the possible numbers are 258, 285, 528, 582, 852, 825.  So here we have 6 numbers
*   If the first digit is 3, the second can be 6.  Possible numbers: 36x, 63x. So numbers would be 369, 396, 639, 693, 963, 936.  So here we have 6 numbers
*   If the first digit is 4, the second can be 7. Possible numbers: 47x, 74x and we already counted them so we are not gonna consider.
*   If the first digit is 5, the second can be 8. Possible numbers: 58x, 85x
So here we have 6 numbers
*   If the first digit is 6, the second can be 9. Possible numbers: 69x, 96x
So here we have 6 numbers.
Now let's find numbers such as 14x where digits must differ by 3:
* If the first digit is 1, the next digit can be 4. 14x. Then, digits must differ by 3. 14x so we have 14x. The possible third digits must be 1-4=3 or 1+3=4. The pairs are (1,4,7) (4,1,4), etc.
*   14x has the pairs (1,4) then the next digit can be 1-4=3 or 1+3=4. Possible number is 141 - No.
*   Pairs of difference 3: (1,4). Number can be 14x. 1 and 4, then the next digit must differ by 3. 14x, The number must be: x-4=3=>x=7, 147. 4-x=3, x=1, 141. 147, so 1 and 4 pair. 147 only. 4-1=3. 14x
*   1 can be pair with 4 => 14x. The third digit should be x. |4-x|=3. So x can be 1 or 7. 141 and 147.
* 4 can be pair with 1 or 7. 41x. So 4-x=3 means x=1. 41x => 417. x-1=3, x=4. No.
*   47x . 4,7. Then we have 4-x=3. x=1. No. 47x=471 4-7 is -3. Next number 7-4=3, 471. 4,7. 4-7=-3, 7-4=3. 4-1=3, 47x. x-7=3 means x=10. No. 47x. Number should be x. If 7. x is 4. The numbers are 147, 471, 741,
*   14x (1,4)  147. 41. No third digit. We can also have. 41, numbers like 141. No, because 1 and 1 are not 3 different. 147, 1-4=3, NO. 1 and 4
* 1 and 4, 14x. 4-x=3, x=1. The numbers are: 4-1=3, x can be 4-3=1. 141 No. x-4=3=> x=7, 147.
*   417. 4-1=3. 7-4=3, 41, 74. 4-7=3, No. The numbers are : 147. 741, 471,
*  Let's find the possible numbers now: 147, 471, 741,
Then numbers are: 147, 741, 417, 258, 285, 528, 582, 825, 852, 369, 396, 639, 693, 936, 963.
So we have 15 numbers. Numbers that differ by 3:
The correct numbers are 147, 471, 741, 258, 285, 528, 582, 825, 852, 369, 396, 639, 693, 936, 963. 14

Numbers such as 147, 741, 141.
Numbers 147, 417.
258, 285, 528, 582, 825, 852.
369, 396, 639, 693, 936, 963.
471. 4 - 7
The numbers are 147, 741, 471,
The possible pairs would be 1 and 4, 4 and 7, 2 and 5.
147, 14x
1, 4 => 147. 41x 417.
147, 471.
258, 582, 852, 285, 528, 825,
369, 693, 963, 396, 639, 936.
So here is 3+6+6=15
