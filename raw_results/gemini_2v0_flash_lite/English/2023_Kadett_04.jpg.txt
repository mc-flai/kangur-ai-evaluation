Reasoning: John has 150 coins, and 60 are showing "head". This means 150 - 60 = 90 coins show "tail". He wants the same amount of heads and tails. So, he wants 150 / 2 = 75 coins showing "head".  He needs to have 75 heads, but currently has 60.  Therefore he needs to turn over 75 - 60 = 15 coins.

Answer: B)
