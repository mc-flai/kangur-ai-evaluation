Reasoning:
1. **Ahmed's path:** Ahmed walks around the square garden. Each side is 5m, so the perimeter of the square is 4 * 5m = 20m.
2. **Sara's path:** Sara walks around the rectangular garden. The sides are 5m and 10m. The perimeter is 2 * (5m + 10m) = 30m.
3. **Relative Speed:** Since they move at the same speed, the distances they cover are proportional to their travel times. They meet at point A for the first time when they both complete a whole number of rounds.
4. **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**  The LCM of the distances they cover must be found.  Think of it as a problem where both need to travel the same amount.  The ratio of their perimeters (30/20 = 3/2) is the same as the number of times Ahmed has to walk per time Sara needs to do so. Ahmed will go 3 rounds for every 2 Sara takes
5. **Calculate the total time to reach point A:** Ahmed goes 3 rounds, for a total distance of 3 * 20m = 60m.
6. **Calculate Sara's rounds to meet:** In that time, Sara goes 60m / 30m/round = 2 rounds. Ahmed then meets Sara at point A.
