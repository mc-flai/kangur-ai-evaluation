Reasoning: We need to find two consecutive numbers where the digit sums are divisible by 7.  Let's start by trying small numbers.
*   If a number is 699, the sum is 6+9+9 = 24 (not divisible by 7). The next number is 700, and the digit sum is 7 (divisible by 7). This has 3 digits.
*   Let's try a number with digits summing to 14: 68 (6 + 8 = 14), next would be 69, sum 15.
*   Let's check digit sums divisible by 7.
    *   7: Examples include 7, 16, 25, 34, 43, 52, 61, 70, 106, 115, 124, 133, etc.
    *   14: Examples include 59, 68, 77, 86, 95, 167
    *   21:  Examples include 399, 489, 498, 579, 588, 597, etc.
    Let's try consecutive numbers to see if it works.
    The number 699 has a digit sum of 24, which is not divisible by 7. The next number is 700, whose sum is 7, which is divisible by 7. The smaller number, 699, has 3 digits.
    Also, we need to consider larger numbers.
    Let's say we have a number like 6999999 (7 digits). The next number would be 7000000. The digit sums are 54 and 7 respectively. However, the minimum case is the first one: 699 and 700.
