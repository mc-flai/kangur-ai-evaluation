Reasoning: The problem asks how much the fruit will cost altogether. We can add the cost of the pear, the banana, and the apple. From the image, we see that an apple and a pear cost 5 Taler, a banana and an apple cost 7 Taler, and a pear and a banana cost 10 Taler.  To solve this, we need to find out how much an apple, a pear, and a banana cost individually. Let's use the following variables: apple (a), pear (p), and banana (b). We have three equations:
1) a + p = 5
2) b + a = 7
3) p + b = 10
Adding all three equations, we get: 2a + 2b + 2p = 22.  Dividing by 2, we get a + b + p = 11.  The question asks about the cost of a pear, a banana, and an apple. So the cost of these three fruits together is 11.
