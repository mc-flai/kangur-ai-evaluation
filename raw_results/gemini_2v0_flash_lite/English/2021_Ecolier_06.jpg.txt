Reasoning: The measuring tape goes around the cylinder. We can see the numbers increase around the cylinder's circumference. Counting forward from the visible numbers, we have: 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, then the question mark, then 29, 30, 31. It is the continuation of a cycle, so the number after 27 is 28. We see that it starts again with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, so the increase continues on the other side to 28. 22+28 = 50, we can see that it increases again at the top to 33. The sequence is 22-31 and from the other side 1-10 so it increases continuously. The increase is in increments, which is a pattern. The question mark is after 27, meaning it should be between 27 and 29. So the answer is 28, adding 22+28 and we get to 50. We see at the bottom it decreases to 22. The numbers wrap around in an increasing pattern. We can see the sequence is 22...27 and then question mark. The question mark is 28. The next number on the sequence will be 29. 28 and 28 will lead to 56. It looks like we have another sequence of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ... so it counts on the other side until 10. The answer is 28, this is not in the choices. However, after 28 it starts again at 29, 30, 31, and then if we count again, the number is 33, with a difference of 6. The best possible answer is 33 since it continues on the cylinder.
