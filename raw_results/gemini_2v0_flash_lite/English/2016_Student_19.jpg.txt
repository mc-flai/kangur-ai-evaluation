Reasoning: Let the number in the inner point be $x$. The top white triangle has vertices 0, 2, and $x$. The sum is $0+2+x = 2+x$. This sum must be divisible by 3. The black triangles have sums that are not divisible by 3.  The left black triangle has vertices 0, 2, and $x$. The sum is $0+2+x = 2+x$. The right black triangle has vertices 2, 2, and $x$. The sum is $2+2+x=4+x$.  For $2+x$ not divisible by 3, $x$ can be 0 or 1. If $x=0$, then $2+0=2$ (not divisible by 3) and $4+0=4$ (not divisible by 3). If $x=1$, then $2+1=3$ (divisible by 3) and $4+1=5$ (not divisible by 3). However, the left black triangle has vertices 0, 2, and $x$, which is not divisible by 3. If $x=2$, then $2+2 = 4$ (not divisible by 3) and $4+2=6$ (divisible by 3).
The triangle at the top is white, so $2+x$ is divisible by 3. The triangles involving the inner point are black triangles, so $2+x$ and $4+x$ must not be divisible by 3. The possible values of $x$ that make $2+x$ divisible by 3 are $x = 1$ (making the sum 3). So $x=1$, $2+x = 2+1=3$, and $4+x = 4+1=5$.
If the inner point is 1, the top white triangle is $0+2+1=3$ (divisible by 3). The left black triangle has $0, 2, 1$, which sums to 3, which is not divisible by 3 according to the problem, but the black triangle sum must not be divisible by 3. So $1$ is a possible answer. Let's consider if $x=0$. The top white triangle sum is $0+2+0=2$, which is not divisible by 3. So it can't be 0. Let's consider if $x=2$, $2+2=4$ not divisible by 3.
So if x=1, the white triangle sums to 3. Then 0+2+1=3 is divisible by 3. Also, the other black triangle has 2+2+1=5 which is not divisible by 3. Also, the triangle containing 0,2,x must be divisible by 3. Thus, the triangle is $0+2+x=3$, x=1.
