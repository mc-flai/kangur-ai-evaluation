Reasoning: The perimeter of the grey area is made up of arcs of the circles. Each arc is a part of a circle. The grey area is made up of 3 such arcs. Each such arc subtends an angle of 60 degrees (π/3 radians) at the center of its circle. The radius of each circle is 1. So the length of each arc is (π/3)*1 = π/3. Therefore, the perimeter of the grey area is 3*(π/3) = π.
Answer: A)
