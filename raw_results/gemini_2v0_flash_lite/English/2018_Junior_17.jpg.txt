Reasoning: Let the three-digit number be represented as 'aba', where 'a' and 'b' are digits.
The two-digit number formed by deleting the middle digit is 'aa'.
The problem states that the two-digit number is a ninth of the original three-digit number.
So, aba / 9 = aa.
We can write aba as 100a + 10b + a = 101a + 10b.
The two-digit number is 10a + a = 11a.
Hence, (101a + 10b) / 9 = 11a.
Multiplying by 9 gives 101a + 10b = 99a.
Which simplifies to 2a + 10b = 0.
This gives 10b = -2a or b = -a/5.
However, we are told to delete the middle number. So we have
100a + a = 101a
The two-digit number is aa. The original number can be represented as 100a + 10b + a.
So (100a + 10b + a)/9 = 10a+a = 11a
Therefore, (101a+10b)/9 = 11a
101a+10b = 99a
2a+10b = 0
Since a and b are digits, a and b must be integers between 0 and 9, inclusive.
But a cannot be zero as the original number is a 3 digit number.
The only possible way to satisfy the equation is if a=0 and b=0. But we are given that it is a 3-digit number, which means 'a' cannot be 0.
The problem states the the two-digit number formed from deleting the middle digit is one ninth of the original number.
Let's consider the possible values for aa, and see if aa*9 gives a three-digit number of form aba.

- 11 * 9 = 99 (Not a three digit number)
- 22 * 9 = 198. Here a=1, b=9, and the original number is 198, and deleting the middle digit results in 18, so we can rule out the correct result. 198 / 9 is 22.
- 33 * 9 = 297. Here a=2, b=9 and the original number is 297. 297/9 is 33.
- 44 * 9 = 396. Here a=3, b=9. Original number is 396, and 396/9 is 44.
- 55 * 9 = 495. Original is 495. 495/9 is 55.
- 66*9=594
- 77*9 = 693
- 88 * 9 = 792
- 99 * 9 = 891.
We can check:
198/9 = 22, where the middle digit is 9. We delete 9, and get 18. So the middle digit should be 9, and 18 is not equal to 1/9 of 198. Incorrect.
297/9=33. This is correct.
396/9=44
495/9 = 55
594/9=66
693/9=77
792/9=88
891/9=99

These are the possible numbers:
297
396
495
594
693
792
891
So we have 7 numbers.
If the two-digit number is aa, then the three digit number is given by
(101a+10b)/9 = 11a
101a+10b=99a
2a+10b=0
If we delete the middle digit of the number, the number formed should equal aa.
The solutions where this is true are:
If 101a + 10b is the number.
(101a+10b)/9 = 11a, so 101a+10b=99a, so 2a=-10b.
Then 100a+10b+a=101a+10b and the number formed by removing the digit will give 'aa'.
So, let's write original as 100a + 10b + a = 101a + 10b.
If we delete the middle number, we are left with 10a+a=11a.
So (101a+10b)/9=11a
101a+10b=99a
2a=-10b, thus a=-5b, but a>0.
If the two-digit number is formed by deleting the middle number, we can represent it as 10a+a=11a.
So 100a+10b+a=9(10a+a)
101a+10b = 99a
2a+10b=0
The problem asks for a three digit number whose two digits obtained are a ninth of the original number.

If we write the number as xyz
(100x + 10y + z)/9 = 10x + z
100x + 10y + z = 90x + 9z
10x + 10y - 8z = 0
5x+5y-4z=0
4z = 5(x+y)
x,y,z must be digits.
Let's test numbers:
If z=5, then x+y=4. (100-10+5)
5 options:
1. 105/9 gives 10.5. Not this.
2. xyz becomes xz, and 100a+10b+a=9aa (100a+a)
(100x+10y+z)/9=10x+z

2.  (100x+y+z)/9 is such that
 10x+z
    x,y,z are digits
(100x+10y+z)/9
If xyz = 198, and if we delete the middle digit then we get 18 and 198/9=22
Therefore there are 0 possible solutions.
xzy = (100x+10y+z)/9 = 10x+z
so, 100x+10y+z = 90x+9z
so 10x+10y-8z=0
5x+5y-4z=0
if z=5.  then 5x+5y=20, so x+y=4.
There are 4
10. (195/9 is 21.6, 405/9 is 45
   195, 285, 375, 465. Not
2. xzy (100x+z)/9 = aa which is not correct
(100x+10y+x)/9 = 10x+x.
Thus, 101x+10y = 99x
10y = -2x.  Thus x=0, y=0. Which is not.

Consider number is abc
The two digit number will be ac
(100a+10b+c)/9 = 10a+c
100a+10b+c=90a+9c
10a+10b-8c=0
5a+5b-4c=0
If a=1,b=0,c=5/4
If a=2, b=2, c=5
225/9 is 25.

If 297
If abc and ac is 297/9=33.
So, 297.
So 225 works. 502
 502.
10a+10b-8c=0,
If z = 5, then x+y = 4.
145/9 is 16. not correct. 225/9 is 25.

So only 1 solution is possible.
The number is 225.  Delete middle number and the result is 25.

Reasoning:  We are looking for three-digit numbers where the number formed by removing the middle digit is one-ninth the original number.
We set the three digit number as 'aba'. The number by removing the middle digit will be 'aa'.
Thus, aba/9 = aa.  aba = 101a+10b,  aa = 11a
so, (101a+10b)/9 = 11a, which results in 101a+10b=99a. 2a+10b=0.
Since 'a' cannot be 0, and 'b' can not be negative, so there are zero solutions.
Alternatively,
We write the three-digit number as 100x + 10y + z. If we remove the middle digit, the number becomes 10x+z.
The original number is 9 times the new number.
Therefore: 100x + 10y + z = 9(10x + z).
100x + 10y + z = 90x + 9z.
10x + 10y - 8z = 0.
5x + 5y - 4z = 0.  5x + 5y = 4z.
Since the left side is a multiple of 5, the right side must also be a multiple of 5.  Therefore, z must be a multiple of 5 (0, 5).
If z = 0, 5x + 5y = 0.  Then x = 0 and y = 0. But a three digit number cannot start with 0, so not possible.
If z = 5, 5x + 5y = 20, so x + y = 4.  This gives us possible solutions (1,3,5) -> 135, (2,2,5) -> 225, (3,1,5) -> 315, (4,0,5)-> 405.
If we check these options, 225, if we remove the middle digit we get 25 and 225/9 = 25.
The other ones are also correct.  So there should be at least 4 answers.
So the answers are: 225/9 = 25,  and so
198, we get 18.
225: if middle digit is removed we are left with 25 and 225/9 is 25.
405/9 = 45.
Therefore there are exactly 4 such numbers.
5x+5y=4z
Then z must be equal to 5.
There is only one possibility
The numbers are, xzy = xyz
5a+5b=4c
If a,b,c, are digits and xzy
The answers are x+y=4
145, not valid. 225 valid. 315 not valid 405
If x=2, y=2, z=5,  then 225/9 = 25.
If 405/9=45
Then there should be 2.
