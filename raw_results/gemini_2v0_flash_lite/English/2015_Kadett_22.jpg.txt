Reasoning:
Let the five numbers be a, b, c, d, and e.
The sums of the pairs are 57, 70, and 83. Since there are five numbers, there are 5C2 = 10 pairs.
The given sums indicate that at least one of the numbers is repeated.
If we let the smallest sum be a+b = 57, the middle sum be a+c = 70, and the largest sum be d+e = 83.
We have the following logic:
The smallest sum is 57, the middle sum is 70, and the largest sum is 83.
The sum of all pairs will be 4(a+b+c+d+e).
Since there are three possible sums, the sums are:
a+b = 57 (1)
a+c = 70 (2)
b+c = 70 (3)
a+d = 83 (4)
a+e= 83
b+d = 83
b+e = 83
c+d = 83
c+e = 83
d+e = 83
Let's analyze the possibilities for the sums:
We could have:
a+b = 57
a+c = 57
a+d = 70
b+c = 70
b+d = 70
c+d = 83
We can assume a <= b <= c <= d <= e
Since there are three different sums, there must be repeated values. The sums 57, 70 and 83. Let's denote a <= b <= c <= d <= e.
The smallest sums are a+b=57.
The largest sums are d+e=83.
Since only 3 sums can be obtained, at least some numbers should be repeated.
Let's assume a+b=57.
If a+c=70 and b+c=70, then a+c=b+c so a=b. Then 2a=57, which is not possible since a is a whole number.
So let the second smallest sum be a+c=70.
If b+c=70, and also a = b so a = 28.5, which is not possible.
So suppose a+b=57, a+c=70, b+d=70.
Then, if c and d are equal, and equal to e, then:
a+b=57
a+c=70
b+c=70 (c is at least as big as b)
c+e=83
d+e=83
c+d=83.
We can test:
We need 5 pairs, where we have only 3 possible results, 57, 70, 83.
If a+b=57, a+c=70, b+c = 70.
Then a = 28.5
Then b+d = 70.
We can consider the numbers x, x, y, z, z.
So sums are:
2x, x+y, x+z, 2z, y+z
Case 1: Sums are 57, 70, 83.
x+y=57, 2x=57...
x=y and z=z.
We are told that there are 3 sums. We need to assume that there must be at least two equal values.
Consider the case: a, a, b, c, c
The smallest sum is 2a=57, which means there can't be two values.
x+y=57
x+z=70
y+z=83
So we have
a+b = 57
a+c = 70
b+c = 83
a+b=57
c = b-57
b-57+c=70, so b+c=70+57
Then a+b=57
a+c=70
b+c=83.
a+b = 57.
Then c = 83-b and a=57-b. a+c=70 so 57-b+83-b = 70. So 140-2b = 70, 2b = 70, b=35
a = 22
c = 48. The numbers are 22, 35, 48.
If we had: 22, 35, 48, 48, 48:
22+35 = 57
22+48 = 70
35+48 = 83
48+48=96

Consider numbers x, y, y, z, z.
Sum of each pair is
2x, x+y, x+z, y+z
Assume the numbers are a, b, c, c, d.
Let the smallest sum be x, second smallest sum be y, and largest sum be z.
Pairs are a+b=57, a+c=70, b+c=70, c+c=83, c+d=83.
a+c=70.
a+b=57
b+c=70
b=70-c, a=57-b. so a=57-b.
c+d=83.
So the cards are 22, 35, 35, 48.
a, b, c, c, d
a+b=57, a+c=70, b+c=70, c+c=x, c+d=83, ...
a=22, b=35, c=35, d=48
Then 22+35=57
22+35=57
22+48=70
35+35=70
35+48 = 83.

22, 35, 35, 35
Sums are 48, 48, 48, 48, 48
So:
a+b=57
a+c=70
b+c=83
57+70+83 = 210

If the cards are x, y, y, z, z
x+y=57.
y+z=70
z+z=83. No
x+y=57.
x+z=70
y+z=83

a+b = 57, a+c = 70, b+d=70, c+d=83, ...

a, b, c, c, d.
22, 35, 35, 48.
22+35=57,
22+48 = 70.
35+48=83.
The cards can be 22, 35, 35, 48, 48.
22, 35, 35, 48, 48
So sums are 57, 57, 70, 70, 70, 83, 83, 83, 96, 96

Numbers = 22, 35, 48.

a+b = 57
a+c = 70
b+c = 83.
a+b+a+c+b+c = 210.
2a+2b+2c = 210.
a+b+c = 105
22, 35, 48
22, 35, 48
22, 35, 48, 48
So 22+48=70.
So 22, 35, 48.
22+35=57
22+48=70
35+48=83.
48+48=96.
Biggest number = 48.

So the cards are a,b,c, c, d.
a+b = 57, a+c = 70, b+c = 70, b+d = 83.
b+d=83
a,b,c,c,d
57=x+y.
a=22
b=35. c=35, d=48.
cards = 22, 35, 48, 48
22+35=57
22+48 = 70
35+48=83
So biggest number = 48.

Cards = 22, 35, 48, 48
So biggest number is 48.

The biggest number will be 48.
