Reasoning:
1. **Identify Black Steps:** The problem states every third step is black. This means approximately 2023/3 steps are black.
2. **Estimate Black Steps:** 2023 / 3 ≈ 674 black steps.
3. **Alternating Feet:** Anita steps on each step once, alternating feet. This means roughly half the black steps she'll use her right foot, the other half with her left.
4. **Minimize Right Foot:** To minimize the number of black steps with her right foot, she should start with her left foot. This will ensure she uses the right foot on the second black step and then alternates. The goal is to estimate the number of steps with the right foot on black. If she always uses the right foot on every other black step, that would be roughly 674 / 2 ≈ 337 black steps for her right foot.
5. **Consider starting point (left/right):** Since the goal is to minimize, we want to delay her placing her right foot on black steps as much as possible. Since steps are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. The pattern is black (3,6), so starting on the left means 3 is left and 6 is left. Since the number of steps are divisible by 3 is 2023/3=674.333 so number of black steps is 674. Number of right foot on black is 337 because 674/2. The number of left foot on black is also 337
