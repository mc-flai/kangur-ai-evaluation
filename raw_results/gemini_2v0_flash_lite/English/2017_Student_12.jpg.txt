Reasoning: Since p < 1 and q > 1, then:
A) p*q will be negative.
B) p + q  will result in a number whose magnitude depends on how much smaller p is than 1 and how much greater q is than 1.
C) p/q will be less than 1 because p < 1 and q > 1.
D) p is less than 1.
E) q is greater than 1.

Thus, q is the greatest.

Answer: E)
