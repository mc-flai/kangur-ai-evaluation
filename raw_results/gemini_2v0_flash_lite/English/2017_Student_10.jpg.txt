Reasoning:
We need to find the function that intersects f(x) = x the most times.
A) g1(x) = x^2: x^2 = x  => x^2 - x = 0 => x(x-1) = 0.  Two solutions: x = 0, x = 1.  2 intersections.
B) g2(x) = x^3: x^3 = x  => x^3 - x = 0 => x(x^2 - 1) = 0 => x(x-1)(x+1) = 0.  Three solutions: x = -1, x = 0, x = 1.  3 intersections.
C) g3(x) = x^4: x^4 = x  => x^4 - x = 0 => x(x^3 - 1) = 0 => x(x-1)(x^2+x+1) = 0.  Two solutions: x = 0, x = 1 (the quadratic has no real roots). 2 intersections.
D) g4(x) = -x^4: -x^4 = x => x^4 + x = 0 => x(x^3 + 1) = 0 => x(x+1)(x^2-x+1) = 0. Two solutions: x = 0, x = -1. 2 intersections.
E) g5(x) = -x: -x = x => 2x = 0 => x = 0. One solution, 1 intersection.

The function g2(x) = x^3 has the most intersections with f(x) = x.

Answer: B)
