Reasoning:
We need to match the temperature trends with the graph.
*   **Friday:** -1°C
*   **Saturday:** -4°C (decrease)
*   **Sunday:** 0°C (increase)
*   **Monday:** 0°C (no change)
*   **Tuesday:** 3°C (increase)
*   **Wednesday:** -3°C (decrease)
*   **Thursday:** -5°C (decrease)
Looking at the graphs:

*   A starts increasing and then decreasing, it does not match the trend
*   B starts decreasing, then slightly increasing, and then a peak and then decreasing. It has the correct overall trend of the data.
*   C starts increasing. Does not match the trend
*   D does not match the trend
*   E does not match the trend

Answer: B)
