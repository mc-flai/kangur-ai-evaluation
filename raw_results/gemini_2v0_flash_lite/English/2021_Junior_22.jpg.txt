Reasoning: We are given that a + b + c = 0 and abc = 78. We want to find the value of (a + b)(b + c)(c + a). We can rewrite the expression using the given equation a + b + c = 0.  Since a + b + c = 0, we have:
a + b = -c
b + c = -a
c + a = -b
So (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = (-c)(-a)(-b) = -abc.
Since abc = 78, we can substitute to get -78.

Answer: B)
