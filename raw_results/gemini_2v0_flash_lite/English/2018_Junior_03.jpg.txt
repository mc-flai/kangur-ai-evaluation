Reasoning: The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. Let's test each odd whole number given as an option.
If the third side is 3: 5 + 2 > 3, 5 + 3 > 2, 2 + 3 = 5 (This doesn't work because 2+3 is not greater than 5).
If the third side is 5: 5 + 2 > 5 (False), 5 + 5 > 2, 2 + 5 > 5 (This doesn't work because 2+5 is not greater than 5).
If the third side is 7: 5 + 2 = 7 (This doesn't work because 5+2 is not greater than 7), 5 + 7 > 2, 2 + 7 > 5
Only A, B, and E are odd numbers, and only option E doesn't work. Option C is not odd, and we already tested these possibilities.

Answer: A)
