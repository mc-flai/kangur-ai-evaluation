Reasoning: The sum of their ages is currently 44. We are looking for the next two-digit number where the digits are the same. The next few numbers that fit this criteria are 55, 66, 77, 88, 99. Since each year, each person turns one year older, the sum of their ages increases by 3 each year (1 + 1 + 1 = 3). So, we add 3 to the current sum of 44 to get 47. Add 3 to that to get 50, then 53, then 56, then 59, then 62, then 65, then 68, then 71, then 74, then 77. So, the sum will be 77 the next time it is a two-digit number with two equal digits.
