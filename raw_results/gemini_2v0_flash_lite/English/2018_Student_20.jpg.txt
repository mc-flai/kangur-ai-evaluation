Reasoning: The angles of a straight line sum to 180 degrees. The interior angle of a rectangle is 90 degrees. Two rectangles share a common line. One rectangle has the angle 30 degrees. The other rectangle has the angle 40 degrees. The angle adjacent to the 30 degree angle is 90-30 = 60 degrees. The angle adjacent to the 40 degree angle is 90-40 = 50 degrees. Alpha and these two angles lie on a straight line. Therefore, alpha = 180 - 60 - 50 = 70. The provided options do not include this result, indicating a possible typo. The alpha angle is not given to us, but from the visual, it is the sum of an angle 50 and an angle 60 (not 180). 360-50-60 - 90-90 = 70

To find alpha: 180 - (90 - 30) - (90 - 40)
alpha = 180 - 60 - 50
alpha = 70.

There is no value of alpha, so it must be different.

Reasoning: The angles adjacent to the 30 degree and 40 degree angles are 90 - 30 = 60 degrees and 90 - 40 = 50 degrees, respectively. Alpha and these two angles lie on a straight line, so their sum is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle alpha is 180 - 60 - 50 = 70 degrees. This answer is not in the options, which means either I am wrong or there is a typo. However, based on the question statement, I did the analysis correctly. It is possible there is a typo with the diagram. We cannot figure out the value from the provided options.

Answer: E)
