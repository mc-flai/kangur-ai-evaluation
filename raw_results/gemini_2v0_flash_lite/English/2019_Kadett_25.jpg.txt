Reasoning:
1. **Monday:** Elisabeth eats 1/10 of 60 pralines, which is 6. Remaining pralines: 60 - 6 = 54.
2. **Tuesday:** She eats 1/9 of the remaining pralines, which is 1/9 * 54 = 6. Remaining pralines: 54 - 6 = 48.
3. **Wednesday:** She eats 1/8 of the remaining pralines, which is 1/8 * 48 = 6. Remaining pralines: 48 - 6 = 42.
4. **Thursday:** She eats 1/7 of the remaining pralines, which is 1/7 * 42 = 6. Remaining pralines: 42 - 6 = 36.
5. **Friday:** She eats 1/6 of the remaining pralines, which is 1/6 * 36 = 6. Remaining pralines: 36 - 6 = 30.
6. **Saturday:** She eats 1/5 of the remaining pralines, which is 1/5 * 30 = 6. Remaining pralines: 30 - 6 = 24.
7. **Sunday:** She eats 1/4 of the remaining pralines, which is 1/4 * 24 = 6. Remaining pralines: 24 - 6 = 18.
8. **Monday (again):** She eats 1/3 of the remaining pralines, which is 1/3 * 18 = 6. Remaining pralines: 18 - 6 = 12.
9. **Tuesday (again):** She eats 1/2 of the remaining pralines, which is 1/2 * 12 = 6. Remaining pralines: 12 - 6 = 6.
10. The problem states that she continues until she eats half of the remaining pralines. The next step will be to eat 1/2 of the remaining 6 pralines, which is 3 pralines, leaving 3 pralines. However, we stop at this point since we can only determine the number of pralines *afterwards*.
