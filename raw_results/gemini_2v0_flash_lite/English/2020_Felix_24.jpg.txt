Reasoning: The bee can only walk on colorful houses. We need to find the number of ways to color exactly three white houses with the same color so that the bee can walk from A to B. There are 6 white houses in total.
Let's analyze possible paths to color the houses:

1.  **Consider the houses that are adjacent to the colored houses (A and B)**. There are 3 possible houses in the first column, 2 in the middle column, and 1 on the right side. If we color the bottom 3 white houses in the same color, the bee can walk from A to B. If we color the top 3 white houses with the same color, the bee can also walk from A to B. In total there are two possible ways in this case.
2.  Let's consider the possibility of coloring the houses in the first column with the same color (3 ways). Then the bee can walk from A to B.
3.  Let's color the houses in a column and the top and bottom white house. Coloring three adjacent houses like the path in the middle is possible.
4.  Let's find the possible ways to color the houses in a way the bee can walk to other options.
5.  Color any combination of white houses in a way the bee can walk from A to B.
6.  Count the ways to achieve path from A to B.
    -Three vertical
    -Three top houses
    -Three bottom houses
    There are total of 2 + 2+2 = 6 ways.

Based on the options, we have to analyze this more careful.
The white houses are in a 3-2-1 pattern, and the bee can only walk on colored houses.
For a path from A to B, the path can go along the border, which requires at least a colored house or one of the other white house.
If the three white houses are colored the same, so that A is connected to B via the colored cells.

There are 6 white houses.
If we color 3 houses, the path from A to B needs to be available.

Case 1: Color the three houses that create a diagonal from the upper most one to the lower most one.
There are two such diagonals.

Case 2: Color the top three houses, one of those houses should be directly connected.
Case 3: Color the bottom three houses
There are 6 configurations.
Let the white cells be:
w1, w2, w3
w4, w5
w6

If we select w1, w4, w6, it's one possibility.

The possible sets of 3 houses:
(w1, w2, w3)
(w4, w5, w6)
(w1, w4, w6)
(w2, w5)

There are 2 configurations to make a path by coloring the white houses.

Consider coloring the first three houses. The path from A to B would be available.
The white houses are at different positions, the available paths are 20.

Answer: E

Reasoning: We analyze possible ways to color three white houses so that a path exists from A to B. We analyze possibilities and count combinations.

Answer: E) 20
