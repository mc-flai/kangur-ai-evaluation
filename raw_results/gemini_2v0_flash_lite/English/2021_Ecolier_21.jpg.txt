Reasoning: The number of cookies must be divisible by 2, 3, and 4. Thus, the number must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, and 4, which is 12. The possible number of cookies are then 12, 24, 36, and 48. The problem says that when dividing the cookies between 7 children, there would be a remainder of 6 (since 6 more are needed). We can check each of the multiples of 12.
- 12 divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 5.
- 24 divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 3.
- 36 divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 1.
- 48 divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 6.
Thus, the answer is 48.
