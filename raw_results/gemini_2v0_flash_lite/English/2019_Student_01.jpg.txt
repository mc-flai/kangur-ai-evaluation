Reasoning: The flag is divided into three equal rectangles. We want the ratio of the side lengths of the white rectangle. Let's consider the width as 1 unit. Then the length of the white rectangle is twice the width of one of the small rectangles (as it is 2 of them). The ratio is then length to height.

If the width is x, the length is 2x.
Therefore, the ratio of side lengths is 2:3.

Answer: B)
