Reasoning: The diagram shows a square carpet with two rows of dots along each edge. Based on the diagram, there are 6 dots in each row, and since it is a square we can consider this 6 dots along one edge and 6 dots on the other edge. So, if we count dots based on edges it would be 6 + 6 + 4 + 4 = 20 in total, but we are counting each corner dot twice, and there are four corners, then we can subtract these 4 extra dots, that is 20 + 20 = 40. Thus, the carpet has 40 dots.
