Reasoning:  Each path consists of a horizontal and vertical segment. The longest path will be the one where the horizontal and vertical segments total a greater arc length. By visual inspection, path (A) and (E) have the longest arcs because they cover 3 of the 4 sections of the largest circle while the other options cover 2 or 1 sections. Path (A) is slightly longer than Path (E)

Answer: A)
