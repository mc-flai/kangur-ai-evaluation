Reasoning: Let 'x' be the initial number of points. Each time Renate adds a point between every pair of adjacent points, the number of points increases by the number of original spaces. After the first repetition, the number of points becomes 2x-1. After the second repetition, the number of points will be 2(2x-1) -1 = 4x-3. After the third repetition, the number of points becomes 2(4x-3) - 1 = 8x-7. Finally after the fourth repetition, the number of points will be 2(8x-7) - 1 = 16x - 15. This number is given as 225. So, 16x - 15 = 225. Therefore 16x = 240 and x = 15.
