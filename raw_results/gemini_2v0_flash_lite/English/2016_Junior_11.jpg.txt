Reasoning: We can deduce the values of a, b, c, and d individually from the equations.  We can find a by setting a + 5 equal to the other values. We can find b by setting b^2 - 1 equal to the other values. We can find c by setting c^2 + 3 equal to the other values. We can find d by setting d - 4 equal to the other values. Once we have the values we can compare which is the biggest.

a+5 = b^2 - 1 => a + 6 = b^2
a + 5 = c^2 + 3 => a + 2 = c^2
a + 5 = d - 4 => a + 9 = d

Since b^2 = a + 6 and c^2 = a + 2 and d = a + 9, we have d > b^2 > c^2 > a. Since d must be the largest we can take the square root of c^2 and b^2. Then take the square root of b^2 and c^2 to compare values, then d is largest.
