Reasoning: First, we need to figure out the total number of teachers. We know that 45 teachers represent 60% of the total. So, if we divide 45 by 0.60, we will find the total number of teachers. 45 / 0.60 = 75 teachers. Now, knowing the total number of teachers (75), we can find the number who come to school by car. The problem states that 12% of the teachers come by car. So, we will multiply 75 by 0.12. 75 * 0.12 = 9.

Answer: C)
