Reasoning: Since there are 20 apples and 20 pears in the box, Carl takes 20 pieces of fruit and Luca takes the rest. There could be any number of apples or pears Carl could take. For example, Carl could have taken all 20 apples and no pears, Carl could have taken 10 apples and 10 pears, or Carl could have taken all 20 pears and no apples. Therefore, we can't say Carl got as many apples as pears, nor can we state he got as many pears as Luca. There is no information stating any relation between the number of fruits Carl took and what Luca took. The only thing we know is that since there were 20 pears in the box, Luca could get at least one pear.
