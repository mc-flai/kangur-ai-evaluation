Reasoning: The problem states that face 6 is adjacent to faces 1, 2, 4, and 5. The problem also states that face 1 is adjacent to faces 6 and 5. The remaining face to be adjacent to the face 6 is 2. The numbers on the faces of the die must be different. Since face 6 has the faces 1, 2, 4, and 5 adjacent to it, the remaining one is 3. Since 4 is adjacent to 6, the opposite must be the one not adjacent to 6. Since the faces 1,2,5,6 are all adjacent to the face 6, the opposite of face 4 must be 3.
Answer: C)
