Reasoning:
Let's analyze the options.
*   **A) 58:** The digit 0 appears 0 times, and the digit 8 appears 1 time.
*   **B) 68:** The digit 0 appears 0 times, and the digit 8 appears 1 time.
*   **C) 70:** The digit 0 appears 1 time, and the digit 8 appears 0 times.
*   **D) 78:** The digit 0 appears 0 times, and the digit 8 appears 1 time.
*   **E) 98:** The digit 0 appears 0 times, and the digit 8 appears 1 time.
Now, if the book ends at 78, then there is only one "0" at the page 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, which is 7 in total. And 8 will appear in 8, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, which means 9 times.
Now consider other numbers:
*   If the last page is between 70 and 78, then the digit 0 is 7 (70) and 8 between 0-7 (1), which is not correct.
*   If the last page is 68, then the digit 0 appears 6 times (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60) and the digit 8 appears 7 times (8, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68).

Answer: B)
