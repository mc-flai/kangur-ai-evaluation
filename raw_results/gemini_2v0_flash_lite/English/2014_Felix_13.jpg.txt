Reasoning: The question asks which shape *cannot* be made with the four pieces. The four pieces are the two triangles from the initial square cut into four pieces, as shown on the right. A close examination of each option reveals that the shapes can indeed be made from these four pieces.
*   **(A)** can be formed from the four pieces.
*   **(B)** can be formed from the four pieces.
*   **(C)** can be formed from the four pieces.
*   **(D)** can be formed from the four pieces.
*   **(E)** can be formed from the four pieces.

Let's rethink. The four pieces can make up one square, and each shape is 1/4 of the square. The four pieces should be two triangles.

**(A)** is not possible because a side is more than 1 side of a small square, and hence can't be formed with the given four pieces.
**(B)** is possible with two triangles.
**(C)** is possible.
**(D)** is possible.
**(E)** is possible.

Answer: A)
