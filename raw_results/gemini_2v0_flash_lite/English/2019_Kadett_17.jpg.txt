Reasoning:
1. **Dogs:** There are 24 animals, and 1/8 are dogs. So, there are (1/8) * 24 = 3 dogs.
2. **Not Cows:** Three-quarters of the animals are not cows. This means 24 * (3/4) = 18 animals are not cows.
3. **Cows:** Since 18 animals are not cows, then there are 24 - 18 = 6 cows.
4. **Not Cats:** Two-thirds of the animals are not cats. This means 24 * (2/3) = 16 animals are not cats.
5. **Cats:**  Since 16 animals are not cats, then there are 24 - 16 = 8 cats.
6. **Kangaroos:** We know the number of dogs, cows, and cats. So, Kangaroos = Total animals - Dogs - Cows - Cats = 24 - 3 - 6 - 8 = 7.
