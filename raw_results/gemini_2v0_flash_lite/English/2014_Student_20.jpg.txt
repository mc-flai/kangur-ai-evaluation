Reasoning:
Let's denote the length of QR as x and PQ as y. Since T is the midpoint of RS and PQRS is a rectangle, then RS = PQ, so RS = y. Also, ST = TR = y/2. Since QT is perpendicular to PR, the triangles PRQ and QTR are similar.
In triangle PQR, we have PQ = y, QR = x, and PR^2 = PQ^2 + QR^2 = y^2 + x^2. Since QT is perpendicular to PR, let's denote the intersection as U.
We can consider the ratio of the areas in two different ways: Area(PQR) = (1/2)*PQ*QR = (1/2)*x*y. Also, since triangles QTR and PQR are similar, we can write QT/PQ = TR/QR, which means QT/y = (y/2)/x. So, QT = y^2/(2x). Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle QTR: QT^2 + TR^2 = QR^2 or QT^2 + (y/2)^2 = x^2 or (y^2/(2x))^2 + (y/2)^2 = x^2. Then y^4/(4x^2) + y^2/4 = x^2 or y^4 + x^2y^2 = 4x^4.
We can also look at similar triangles. In triangle QTR and PQR, TR/QR = QR/PR, so (y/2) / x = x / PR.  Therefore PR = 2x^2/y.  Also, PR^2 = x^2 + y^2 so 4x^4/y^2 = x^2 + y^2, giving 4x^4 = x^2y^2 + y^4.  We know that QT is normal to PR, hence the slope of QT * slope of PR = -1. Slope of PR = x/y, Slope of QT = (QT's coordinates aren't necessary.)
The ratio is y/x.  Consider the right triangle QTR with legs QT and RT.  QT is perpendicular to PR. TR = y/2. Triangle QTR is similar to triangle PQR. The similar triangles are RQT and RQP since they share angle R, and both have a right angle.
QT/PQ = RT/QR, or QT/y = (y/2)/x, implying QT = y^2/(2x). Also, QR^2 = QT^2 + TR^2, so x^2 = (y^4)/(4x^2) + (y^2)/4.
So, 4x^4 = y^4 + x^2 y^2.
Then 4x^4 = y^2(y^2+x^2) = y^2 PR^2. PR = sqrt(x^2+y^2).
