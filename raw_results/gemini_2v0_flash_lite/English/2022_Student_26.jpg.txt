Reasoning:
Let's label the circles from top to bottom, left to right, as follows:
Left Column: A, B, C, D
Right Column: E, F, G, H
Bottom Row: D, I, H

We are given:
A + B + C + D = 24
E + F + G + H = 24
D + I + H = 25

The numbers 1 to 10 are used.
The total sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 is (10 * 11) / 2 = 55.
The sum of all the circles is (A+B+C+D) + (E+F+G+H) + I + (D+I+H) - (D+H) = 55.

Substituting the given sums:
24 + I + 24 - (D+H) = 55 - (D+H), as we are counting D and H twice
We know the total sum is 55,
A+B+C+D+E+F+G+H+I = 55
We have D and H appear in both sums.
So we know, (A+B+C+D) + (E+F+G+H) + I = 24 + 24 + I.
We know bottom row sum is 25.  Therefore, D + I + H = 25.
55 = 24 + 24 + I.  So  D+I+H=25, and D and H are in the sum, so
Therefore, 55 = (A+B+C+D) + (E+F+G+H) + I = 24 + 24 + I.

55 = 48 + I
I is the only number that appears only once in this total.
So, I = 55 - 48 = 7, but the question mark is next to I in the picture.

We are given that D+I+H=25
So if I = 7, D+H=25-7=18
Also, (1+2+3+...+10) = 55.
Sum of numbers in all columns + bottom row is 24+24+25=73.
But each number appears once unless its on the bottom row or a column. Then the question marks is only contained on the bottom row so we use numbers on columns or bottom row to remove the repeated values
So if the sum is 73, there are 73-55=18 numbers. And there are two numbers that overlap from the bottom row to a column. D and H have the same sum. So D and H are 9 and 9, but these numbers are all different.

Let's deduce the values and apply logic
Numbers not in the left or right column or bottom row: 1,2,3
D+H = 18 and D and H are distinct numbers. We know the number in the middle is 7
Consider a potential solution:
Left Column: A=1, B=2, C=8, D=13 (impossible as we only use numbers 1-10)
Consider another potential solution:
D = 9, H = 9 - impossible.
If the number on the bottom is I: then I=7
If the number in question is not I (in the middle). It must be D and H.
Numbers 1 to 10 in the circles.
Left = 24
Right = 24
Bottom row = 25
Total sum = 55
D+I+H=25. We know the sum of left is 24 and the sum of the right is 24.
If we assume the middle number is 7 (I=7), we also have D+H = 18. (D, H appear both in sum)
The numbers that we haven't used are from the central values or from the edges. Numbers that are in both left and bottom or right and bottom, are D, H.
Since I is 7, we know we cannot use it again. Also each circle has a distinct number.
Remaining numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10.
If bottom row has the sum 25, and I is the only unique number.
So D+H=18. Possible values are 8, 10 and 9.  (8+10,9+9)
Possible values of D and H are 8 and 10. Let D=8, H=10. Sum is 25
Numbers that were used: 7, 8, 10.
The left and right column has values 24. So 24-8 =16. A+B+C=16. And E+F+G=14
Possible A+B+C combinations = 1+5+10, 1+6+9, 2+4+10 etc.
A, B, C have values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
If we take 2+9+5 = 16. Numbers used are 2, 5, 9.

Right column, must be 24:  1,3,4,6 =14. 3, 4, 6 = 13
If question mark is 5.
D is 8 and H=10, and I is 7. Then if question mark is 5, we can confirm.
A B C D.  5 is in one of these spots. Let's try, the 5 is C.

If A=1, B=2, C=5, D=16 (NOT possible)
Let the unknown be 5.
The number in the question mark is therefore 5.

Answer: C)
