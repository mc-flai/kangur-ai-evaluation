Reasoning:
The equation is 2ab = 3cd. This means that 2ab must be a multiple of 3, implying that either 'a' or 'b' is a multiple of 3. Similarly, 3cd must be a multiple of 2, meaning either 'c' or 'd' is a multiple of 2. We want to find which of the answer choices could equal abcd.
Let's examine the choices:
A) 50 = 2 * 5 * 5
B) 100 = 2 * 2 * 5 * 5
C) 150 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 5
D) 200 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 5 * 5
E) 250 = 2 * 5 * 5 * 5
From the prime factorizations, the product abcd must have one factor of 2 and one factor of 3 if we rearrange our terms.
If abcd = 150, then the prime factorization is 2 * 3 * 5 * 5.
We could assign a = 3, b=25/3. That will not result in an integer for abcd.
To make integers, lets try
ab = 15, cd = 10
ab = 5, cd = 6, this will produce an abcd of 30.
If we take abcd to be 100, ab = 15, cd = 200/3.
Considering option C) 150. We can try a=3, b=5, c=2, d=5. Then 2ab = 2*3*5 = 30, and 3cd= 3*2*5 =30. So, abcd = 3 * 5 * 2 * 5 = 150.

Answer: C)
