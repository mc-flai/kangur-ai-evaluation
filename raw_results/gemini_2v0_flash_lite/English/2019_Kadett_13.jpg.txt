Reasoning: The two pieces that can be used to build a 4x4 square are: 1) a 3x1 L-shape and 2) a 2x2 square. We need to identify the 4x4 square that can not be built using these 2 shapes. Analyzing the options A to E:
*   A can be built
*   B can be built
*   C can be built
*   D can be built
*   E can't be built because you would need one of the 'L' shapes and one of the 2x2 squares.

Answer: E)
