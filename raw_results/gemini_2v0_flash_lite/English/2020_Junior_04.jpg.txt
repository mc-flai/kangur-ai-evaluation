Reasoning: We need to find four integers whose product is 9 and whose sum is the lowest possible value. We can start by listing the integer factors of 9. 9 can be factored as 1x1x1x9, 1x-1x-1x9 or 3x3x1x1 or -3x-3x1x1 etc. The sum of 1,1,1,9 is 12. The sum of 1, -1, -1, 9 is 8. The sum of 3,3,1,1 is 8. The sum of -3, -3, 1, 1 is -4. The sum of -3, -3, -1, -1 is -8. The sum -9, 1, 1, 1 is -6. To minimize the sum, we want to include negative integers. Since the product is positive, we must have an even number of negative integers. The combination -3,-3,1,1 has a product of 9 and sum of -3-3+1+1=-4. The combination -9, -1, 1, 1 does not work as the product is 9 and sum is -8. Considering the combination of integers, we need to consider negative integers. The product being 9 means the integers can either be all positive or an even number of negative integers. We could try -9, -1, 1, 1 which would result in the product being 9 and sum -8.
