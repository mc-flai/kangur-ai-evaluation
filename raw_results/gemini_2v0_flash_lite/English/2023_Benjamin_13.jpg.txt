Reasoning:
1.  **Analyze the statements:** Maria says "It was Peter". Peter says "It was Richard". Richard says "It wasn't me". Tina says "It wasn't me".
2.  **Consider each person's statement as the truth:**
    *   If Maria is telling the truth, then Peter broke the window. This would mean Peter, Richard, and Tina are all lying. This is a possible scenario.
    *   If Peter is telling the truth, then Richard broke the window. This would mean Maria, Richard, and Tina are all lying. This is a possible scenario.
    *   If Richard is telling the truth, then he didn't break it. This means both Peter and Maria are lying. However, if Richard is truthful, then either Peter broke it, or Maria broke it, contradicting their own statements. Also, Tina would also be telling the truth, contradicting the given information that only one person told the truth. Thus, Richard cannot be telling the truth.
    *   If Tina is telling the truth, then she didn't break it. This is the same scenario as with Richard, therefore, Tina cannot be the one who is truthful.
3.  **Determine the contradictions:** Richard and Tina's statements directly contradict each other. Furthermore, if Richard or Tina are telling the truth, then 2 of the statements will have to be truthful.

Therefore, either Maria or Peter is telling the truth. However, in order to find out who broke the window, we must check all the statements, and only one of the statements is correct, according to the given information. So, looking back, Maria said Peter did it, and Peter said Richard did it. Richard and Tina both said they didn't do it.
If Maria is telling the truth, then Peter broke the window. In this scenario Peter, Richard, and Tina would have to be lying.
If Peter is telling the truth, then Richard broke the window. In this scenario, Maria, Richard, and Tina would have to be lying.
Because only one person can be telling the truth, if either one, Maria or Peter, are telling the truth, we know that either Peter or Richard broke the window.
4.  **If Maria is telling the truth**, the answer is that Peter broke the window.
5.  **If Peter is telling the truth**, the answer is that Richard broke the window.
However, we are not sure which answer is correct based on the information provided, which is why the answer is that it can not be determined.
