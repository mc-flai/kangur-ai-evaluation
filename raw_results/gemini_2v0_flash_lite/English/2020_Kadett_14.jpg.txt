Reasoning: Let 'x' be the total number of students in the class. We know that 3/8 of the students swim, and 5 students do both. Since the question asks for the "at least" number of students, we need to consider the smallest possible number of students such that the information given is satisfied. Since 3/8 of the students swim, 'x' must be a multiple of 8. We also know that those who do both activities, the 5 students, are included in the 3/8 that swim. So, 3/8 * x must be greater than or equal to 5. Let's test the answer choices starting with the smallest values:

*   If x=16: 3/8 \* 16 = 6. 6 students swim, and 5 of them also dance. So, 1 student swims but doesn't dance. This is a possible scenario.
*   If x=24: 3/8 * 24 = 9. 9 students swim, and 5 of them also dance. This means 4 students swim but don't dance. This is also possible.
*   If x=32: 3/8 * 32 = 12. 12 students swim, and 5 of them also dance. This means 7 students swim but don't dance. This is also possible.
*   If x=40: 3/8 * 40 = 15. 15 students swim, and 5 of them also dance. This means 10 students swim but don't dance. This is also possible.
*   If x=48: 3/8 * 48 = 18. 18 students swim, and 5 of them also dance. This means 13 students swim but don't dance. This is also possible.
We have to use the smallest possible value of 'x', therefore it must be 16.
