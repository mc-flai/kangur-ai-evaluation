Reasoning: The diagonal of the square is split into several segments. The question asks for the longest segment of the diagonal. Notice that the area of the square is 30. A diagonal divides the square into two equal triangles of area 15. The areas of some of the triangles formed are given. The segments of the diagonal can be related to the areas of the triangles. From the diagram we see that the segment 'e' forms a triangle with an area of 4, the segment 'b' is part of a triangle with area 5 and the segment 'd' is part of a triangle with area 9. The longer the segment of the diagonal the larger the area of the triangles formed by the diagonal. Therefore, since the area related to 'd' is 9 which is the largest given area, the segment 'd' is the longest.

Answer: D)
