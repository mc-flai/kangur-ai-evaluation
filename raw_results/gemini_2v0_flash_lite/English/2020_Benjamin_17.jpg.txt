Reasoning: We need to find a wire shape that, when duplicated and its two copies are joined end-to-end, can create a closed shape without the wires crossing.
*   **A:** Duplicating and joining end-to-end would create a shape like a figure eight, which doesn't create a closed shape.
*   **B:** Duplicating and joining end-to-end would create a closed shape.
*   **C:** Duplicating and joining end-to-end doesn't create a closed shape.
*   **D:** Duplicating and joining end-to-end doesn't create a closed shape.
*   **E:** Duplicating and joining end-to-end wouldn't create a closed shape.

Answer: B)
