Reasoning:
The question asks to decode the encoded word B3B2C4D2.
Let's decode the word using the provided key:
- B3 corresponds to M
- B2 corresponds to P
- C4 corresponds to T
- D2 corresponds to H
Therefore, the decoded word is M, P, T, H
It doesn't seem like the correct answer is among the given options. However, looking at the question again, the word PIZZA = A2A4C1C1B2, meaning that each character is composed of 2 letters (A, 2) meaning A at line 2.
If we follow the example given,
- B3 = M
- B2 = P
- C4 = T
- D2 = L
So, the decoded word should be M, P, T, L, and since there are no options with 4 letters, perhaps this is not the right approach.

Let's try again:
- B3 = M
- B2 = P
- C4 = T
- D2 = H
So, the encoded word should be MPTH, but no options are close.

However, if we look at the question:
What word did Tom encode as B3B2C4D2?
Looking at the correct answer choices, we can assume that the question might be wrong and may be MPTH or MATE.

Let's decode B3B2C4D2
B3 = M
B2 = P
C4 = T
D2 = H
So, the word is MPTH, which is not in the given options. If we choose MATE, the encoding would be B3B2D2.

Let's decode the given options, and compare to B3B2C4D2
(A) MAZE : A3A2D1B2
(B) MASK : B3A2C3K, this is not correct
(C) MILK : B3I2L
(D) MATE: B3B2C1E, the word encoded is close.
(E) MATH: B3A2C3H, the word encoded is not close.
The question is tricky. Let's assume that D2 represents the last character.
B3B2C4D2
M, P, T, H
Mate is close.

Answer: D)
