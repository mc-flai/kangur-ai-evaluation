Reasoning: When the net is folded into an open box, the sides A, B, C, D, and E form the sides of the box. If the opening is on the top, the side opposite the opening (which is formed by the net) will be facing the table. Sides A and B would form the sides of the opening. The base of the box is formed by either side C, D, or E. Since the question is which side is facing the table and the opening is on the top, it means one of the sides adjacent to the opening will form the base.
Answer: C)
