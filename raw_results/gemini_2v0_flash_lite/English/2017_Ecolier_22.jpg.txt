Reasoning:
Susi can visit two animals, but cannot start with the lion. The animals are giraffe (G), elephant (E), lion (L), and turtle (T). The possibilities for visits are:
1.  G followed by E
2.  G followed by T
3.  E followed by G
4.  E followed by T
5.  T followed by G
6.  T followed by E
7.  G followed by L (lion is excluded from starting)
8.  E followed by L (lion is excluded from starting)
9.  T followed by L (lion is excluded from starting)
10. L followed by G (Invalid)
11. L followed by E (Invalid)
12. L followed by T (Invalid)
So, the valid combinations are GE, GT, EG, ET, TG, TE. There are 6 valid combinations.
The question asks for 'to visit the two animals *one after the other*', meaning the order matters.
The possible pairings where Lion is not the starting animal are:
*   Giraffe first: Giraffe-Elephant, Giraffe-Turtle
*   Elephant first: Elephant-Giraffe, Elephant-Turtle
*   Turtle first: Turtle-Giraffe, Turtle-Elephant
*   Giraffe second: Elephant-Giraffe, Turtle-Giraffe
*   Elephant second: Giraffe-Elephant, Turtle-Elephant
*   Turtle second: Giraffe-Turtle, Elephant-Turtle

Total is 6.
If the order matters, we have 6 combinations.

Answer: B)
