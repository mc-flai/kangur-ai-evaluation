Reasoning: The middle balance shows two dogs and a 12kg weight. The right balance shows 20 kg weight. Since all dogs are equally heavy, then two dogs have to weigh 20kg. If we also know that two dogs equal 12kg + two dogs, we need to determine how heavy one dog is. Subtracting the weight of two dogs from both sides, we know that the weight of the 20kg weight must be 12kg plus the weight of two dogs. That means the weight of two dogs equals 8 kg, and the weight of a single dog must be half of that. 8/2 = 4kg. However, since 20 kg must be 12 kg plus the weight of two dogs, we have the 2 dogs, and we know that one dog must be half of the difference between 20 kg and 12 kg, which is 8 kg.  8/2 = 4. There appears to be an error in the balancing of the scales, therefore there is no answer. I have made a mistake, the two dogs weigh 20 kg.
