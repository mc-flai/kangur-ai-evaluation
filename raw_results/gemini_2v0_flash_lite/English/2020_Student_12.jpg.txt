Reasoning:
1. Initially, all 2020 coins are "heads" up. We want to make them all "tails" up.
2. Each move flips 3 coins.
3. We need to flip a number of coins divisible by 2020. We want to minimize the number of moves.
4. Consider the remainder when 2020 is divided by 3. 2020 / 3 = 673 with a remainder of 1. Since we need to change all the coins to the tails side, if we change the 2020 coins to tails, the number of coins must be a multiple of 3. Then we can not directly make all coins be tails after several moves (3 coins at once).
5. Therefore it's impossible to change the 2020 coins to tails.
