Reasoning:
1.  Let BC = x. Then AC = 2x (given).
2.  Since ABCD is a rectangle, angle B = 90 degrees.
3.  In triangle ABC, AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2 (Pythagorean theorem). Therefore, AB^2 + x^2 = (2x)^2, implying AB^2 = 3x^2, and AB = xâˆš3.
4.  Since |AX| = |XC|, triangle AXC is an isosceles triangle.
5.  In triangle ABC, sin(angle BAC) = BC/AC = x/2x = 1/2. Therefore, angle BAC = 30 degrees.
6.  Let angle CAX = theta. In triangle AXC, angle AXC = 180 - 2*theta. Also angle ACD = 90 degrees.
7.  Consider the triangle ADC, where AC is the diagonal.
8.  Since AX=XC, so it is an isosceles triangle.
9.  Angle ACD=90, Angle CAD= angle BAC
10. By sine rule in triangle AXC, we have: XC/sin(CAX)=AX/sin(ACX), since AX=XC => sin(CAX) = sin(ACX). so, angle CAX = angle ACX
11. in triangle ABC, BC = AC/2, so angle BAC is 30.
12. Consider triangle ADC, where AC is a diagonal and AD = BC.
13. Also angle DAC = 90 - 30 = 60 degrees, therefore angle ACD = 90 - (60 - theta) = 30 + theta.
14. In triangle AXC, CAX = ACX, thus
CAX + ACX + AXC = 180
2CAX + AXC = 180.
Also from the problem the angle CAX= angle ACX.

15. From triangle ABC, since BC = AC/2, then angle BAC = 30 degrees. Therefore, angle CAD = 90 - 30 = 60 degrees.
16. Let angle CAX be theta. Then angle DAC = 60. Angle CAX = theta. Thus Angle DAX = 60-theta.
17. Since AX = XC, Angle ACX = Angle CAX = theta. Angle ACD = 90. Angle DCX = 90-theta. Also, since angle BCD = 90 degrees in rectangle.
18. Since angle CAX = angle ACX, then angle ACX = 90 - angle BAC, therefore the triangle AXC, we have
CAX = theta.  ACX= theta. Thus: theta+ theta= 30+ theta;
or angle CAD = 60;
and since angle ACX= 90- angle BAC = 60
and the ACX is equal to angle CAX.
Thus 2 theta= 60; theta = 27.5. so angle CAX= 27.5
19. thus angle ACB = 90-30= 60. Thus
theta = 2*theta
Thus CAX= 30
