Reasoning:
1. **Total possible points:** Each die has 6 faces with points from 1 to 6. The sum of points on a single die is 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21.  Since we have 7 dice, the maximum possible sum is 7 * 21 = 147.
2. **Hidden Faces:**  We need to determine the number of hidden faces. The structure shows that a central die has 6 faces, 6 dice are placed around the central cube. Each of these 6 dice has one face glued to the central cube. The faces of all the dice are only glued to other faces of the dice, this forms a cube. Thus 1 face is attached to central die, other 4 attached to other dice. We can see 3 faces on each of the 6 dice. Thus, we can see 1+3*6=19 faces.
3. **Faces with similar points:** Each face glued together has the same number of points.
4. **Calculating Hidden Points:** Each glued face is hidden. Let 'x' be the number of faces hidden.  We need to find the number of visible points.  Each glued face has the same number of points. There are 6 glued faces. Each face has 1-6 points, which is 21.
5. **Calculation:** Sum on the faces of the 7 dice = 7 * (1+2+3+4+5+6) = 7 * 21 = 147
The number of visible faces = 1 + 3 * 6 = 19 faces.
The number of faces hidden = (6 + 4 * 6 /2)
Total faces = 6 * 7 = 42, 6+12, 1 face on each of the dice is hidden
Total visible faces = 19
Since each of the 6 dice have 1 face covered, there are 6 covered faces on the sides. The central die faces are each exposed. 7 dice - 6= 19
There are 6 faces glued, we have 6 * points on faces glued
So, total of each dice =21, total points =147
Each of the 6 glued faces must have equal number of points. 1 face is glued on each of the 6 side dice.
We see 19 faces. Each face is glued together. The opposite face of a die sums to 7. So, for a die the total sum is 21.
We can see 19 faces.
1+3+3+3+3+3+3 =20 visible faces.
19 faces can be seen. If each glued face has 3, 3x6
Total faces 1*x + 3 *6x = 19 faces
Total is 19.
Assume all hidden faces are 3: 147 - 6*3=129, Not correct
Faces glued on the central cube have equal sum, as the dice are identical.
Sum = 147- 6*mean of die faces=147- 6*3.5=126
147-(6 faces)=126
So we can see 19 faces. 7 dice, 19 faces
21*7=147 total
6 faces glued together.
Let's say each has a point of 3.
147-6*3.5 = 147-21 = 126
So, each glued face has points that are same.
