Reasoning:
The problem requires finding the smallest starting number for four consecutive positive whole numbers, such that the sum of any three of them is not a prime number. We can test the options provided.

*   **E) 3:** The numbers would be 3, 4, 5, 6. The sums of three numbers would be: 3+4+5 = 12 (not prime), 3+4+6 = 13 (prime). This is not correct.
*   **D) 6:** The numbers would be 6, 7, 8, 9. The sums of three numbers would be: 6+7+8 = 21 (not prime), 6+7+9 = 22 (not prime), 6+8+9 = 23 (prime). This is not correct.
*   **C) 7:** The numbers would be 7, 8, 9, 10. The sums of three numbers would be: 7+8+9 = 24 (not prime), 7+8+10 = 25 (not prime), 7+9+10 = 26 (not prime), 8+9+10 = 27 (not prime). This satisfies the criteria.
*   **B) 10:** The numbers would be 10, 11, 12, 13. The sums of three numbers would be: 10+11+12 = 33 (not prime), 10+11+13 = 34 (not prime), 10+12+13 = 35 (not prime), 11+12+13 = 36 (not prime). This satisfies the criteria, but it is not the *smallest* possible number.
*   **A) 12:** The numbers would be 12, 13, 14, 15.  The sums of three numbers would be: 12+13+14 = 39 (not prime), 12+13+15 = 40 (not prime), 12+14+15 = 41 (prime).

The smallest number that meets the requirements is 7.

Answer: C)
