Reasoning: The thickness of the roll decreases as the unrolled part of the toilet paper increases. Because each layer of toilet paper has a consistent thickness, as you unroll the toilet paper, the remaining roll gets thinner. Also, the rate of decrease of the thickness should slow down because the circumference of the roll decreases with each layer. This is best represented by a decreasing curve, which is seen in options (D) and (E). Between the two options, the thickness in (E) is more representative as it starts at a higher value than option (D).

Answer: E)
