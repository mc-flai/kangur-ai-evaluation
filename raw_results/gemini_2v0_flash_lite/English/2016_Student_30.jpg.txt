Reasoning:
Let the factors of N be $f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4, f_5, f_6$, where $f_1 = 1$ and $f_6 = N$.
Given $f_1 \cdot f_2 \cdot f_3 \cdot f_4 \cdot f_5 = 648$.
Since N has 6 factors, N must be of the form $p^5$ where p is prime, or of the form $p^2 \cdot q$ where p and q are distinct primes.
If $N = p^5$, then the factors are $1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4, p^5$. The product of the first five factors is $1 \cdot p \cdot p^2 \cdot p^3 \cdot p^4 = p^{10} = 648$. However, $\sqrt[10]{648}$ is not an integer.
If $N = p^2 \cdot q$, then the factors are $1, p, q, p^2, pq, p^2q$ (or some permutation).
$1 \cdot p \cdot q \cdot p^2 \cdot pq = p^4q^2 = 648 = 2^3 \cdot 3^4$ or $1 \cdot p \cdot q \cdot p^2 \cdot q = p^3 q^2$, which is not equal to 648.
Then consider $1, p, q, p^2, pq, p^2q$. Product of 5 of the factors:
$1 \cdot p \cdot q \cdot p^2 \cdot pq = p^4q^2 = 648 = 2^3 \cdot 3^4$ (or $2 \cdot 3^4$)
The product of five factors is $p^4 q^2=648$. This doesn't yield integer solutions for p and q.
Consider factors to form the product of five factors, and match with the options.
$648 = 2^3 \cdot 3^4$
If we take 1, 4, 9, 12, 18, 27. 4, 9, 12.
Consider $1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 36, 108$
$1, 3, 9, 24, 27$, then missing factor = N.
If the factors are 1, x, y, xy, x^2, x^2y. Product = 648.
648 can be factored as $2^3 3^4$.
$1 \times a \times b \times ab \times a^2$
Product of 5 numbers = 648.
Then the factors can be x, y. Then xy is a factor.
Take 1, 3, 9, 12, 18.
1, 4, 9, 12, x.
The factors are 1, x, y, xy, N/x, N.
Possible values for N:
$1 \times 3 \times 4 \times 9 \times 12 = 648$.
Then 648/1 = 648.
$1, x, y, xy, x^2, x^2y$ or similar
$648 = 1 * 4 * 9 * 18 * x$ is possible.
1, 3, 9. Then 1 x 9 = 9; 3 x 3 = 9.
Factors 1, 3, 6, 9, 18, 36.
1, 4, 9. Then 1, 4, 9, 12. 1, 9, 12, x, x = 18.
1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18.
Product of 5 = 648. Then 1 x 2 x 3 x 9 x 12 = 648.
Then 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18. Then the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 9, 12. The sixth factor is 36.

The factors are 1, 4, 9, 12, 18, 36
Product = 648.

$1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 6 \cdot 9 = 324$
$1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 9 \cdot 12$

The factors are 1, 4, 9, 12, 18 and N.
The factor is 36.
$4 \cdot 9 = 36$.
$648/36$

Then the numbers are 1, x, y, xy, x^2, x^2 y.

Answer: C)
1,3,9, 12,4
The factors are 1, 3, 6, 9, 18, 36.
If we take 1, 2, 3, 9, x.
1x3x9 = 27.
Product is 1,9,x,12,4
$4*9*1*x*12*x = 648$

$1 \cdot 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 12 \cdot 18$
The factors are 1, x, y, xy, p^2, p^2 q.
1, 4, 9.
So we are missing $N/1 = N = 36$
