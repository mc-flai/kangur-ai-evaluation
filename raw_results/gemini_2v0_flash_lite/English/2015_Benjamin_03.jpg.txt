Reasoning: To minimize the number of squares to repaint, we need to identify the pairs of adjacent squares that have the same color. In the given image, we see that two squares are white, two are grey, and two are black. Let's start by checking the squares that share sides that have the same color.  We can change any adjacent squares of the same color. Observing the image, we can see that the top two squares are different colours, as are the two squares below them and to the left. The number of squares to repaint to achieve the goal depends on the initial coloring.

If we change the white square and the grey square in the top row to a new color, we would only need to paint over two squares to ensure that no two squares sharing a side have the same color.

Answer: A)
