Reasoning:
The 4x4 grid has 16 squares. One square is missing, so there are 15 squares. When divided into three equal pieces, each piece should have 15/3 = 5 squares.
Now, let's count the squares for each option:
A) 5 squares
B) 5 squares
C) 5 squares
D) 5 squares
E) 5 squares
All options have 5 squares. The shape of the grid that remains is shown in the question. Therefore, we look at the shapes and see which one fits within the grid's shape:

A) Fits
B) Doesn't fit
C) Fits
D) Fits
E) Doesn't fit

Now, let's select the answer. The most likely answer is A, C, and D. But the easiest one that is the right size and shape is A.

Answer: A)
