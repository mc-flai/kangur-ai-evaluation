Reasoning:
1.  The key constraint is that the sum of the three sections must be the same. Each section must have the same sum, since the sections contain all the numbers from 1-5.
2.  The sections are defined by the black borders.
3.  The numbers 1 to 5 must appear once in each row and in each column.
4.  The top-right cell belongs to a black-bordered section.
5.  The bottom-left cell contains the number 2.
6.  Consider the section containing 2. This section must have a sum (S). The other two sections must also have the same sum (S). The total sum of all the numbers from 1 to 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. Each section must contain 5 numbers. We know from the question that all numbers in a section must always be the same. Therefore, we can divide the total sum by 3, (15/3=5). Each sum must equal 5.
7.  The bottom-left corner is 2. This section is: 2 + x + y. Therefore, x+y = 3. Since the sum of the three sections must be the same (5). 
8.  Consider the top right section and top row. If we place 1 there, The row becomes [1, x, 3, y, z] .The column above 2 must be 4 or 5.
9.  Considering the constraints it is very easy to see that 3 must be written in the top right cell.

Answer: C)
