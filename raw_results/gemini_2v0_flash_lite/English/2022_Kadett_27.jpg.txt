Reasoning: We need to color cells to cover all 1x4 and 4x1 rectangles.  Consider the 5x5 grid.
*   To cover all horizontal 1x4 rectangles, we need to color at least every fourth cell in each row. This can be achieved by coloring one cell in each set of 4 consecutive cells within each row. This requires at least one cell to be colored in each set of 4, so at least one cell must be colored in each set of 4 horizontally (i.e., 1, 5 or 2, 6 or 3, 7 or 4, 8 or 5, 9). Similarly for the columns.
*   Consider coloring cells in a pattern. Coloring cells in a checkerboard pattern doesn't work. Consider alternating coloring cells horizontally starting from the first cell in the first row. Then color the 1st, 5th, 9th, 13th, 17th, 21st, 25th. Then we have to consider how the vertical lines interact with the horizontal lines.
*   We can color cells (1,1), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (5,5). This covers all 1x4 rectangles. It also covers all 4x1 rectangles. However, we can find a better solution. Coloring (1,1), (1,5), (5,1), (5,5) doesn't work.
*   Let's try coloring the cells at coordinates (1,1), (1,5), (5,1), (5,5) in a checkerboard pattern. Consider 3 vertical lines. Color them at the 2nd, 3rd and 4th positions. Now we need to also color horizontal positions.
* Let's color the positions (1,1), (1,5), (3,3), (5,1), (5,5). This would cover all 1x4.  Consider the four corners: We have to color every four of them, which is not ideal.
*  Consider the following coloring:
    (1,1), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (5,5). This covers all 1x4 and 4x1 rectangles. That is 7 cells.
    (1,1)
    (1,5)
    (2,4)
    (3,3)
    (4,2)
    (5,1)
    (5,5)
    This requires 7 cells.
    If we color (1,1), (1,5), (5,1), (5,5), (3,3) we need to color 5 cells.
    If we color (1,1), (1,5), (3,3), (5,1) , (5,5), we have 5 cells
    So, we need 5 cells.
    If we color (1,1), (1,5), (3,3), (5,1) and (5,5). Now let's consider the rectangles.

    If we color (1,2), (1,4), (3,3), (5,2), (5,4), this is 5.
    Coloring the diagonal cells may be a good idea. (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5). This would be 5 cells
    Then we can choose other cells to cover 1x4 and 4x1 rectangles.

    The coloring can also be done as follows: color the cells (1, 1), (1, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5) and (3, 3).

*   Consider coloring (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,1), (5,3), (1,4). This gives 7 cells.

Reasoning: We need to color cells such that every 1x4 and 4x1 rectangle contains a colored cell.

Let's consider a pattern of coloring with 7 cells. (1,1), (1,5), (2,3), (3,2), (4,4), (5,1), (5,5).

Coloring the cells with coordinates (1,1), (1,5), (3,3), (5,1), (5,5).

This pattern seems incorrect. Coloring is the key to solving this puzzle.
Consider coloring cells at coordinates (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,1), (5,3).

Then all horizontal and vertical rectangles are colored. 6 cells are colored. This seems correct. Coloring (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,5), (3,3), then this does not cover 4x1 rectangle.

Let's analyze if we can solve it with 5 cells.

If we color (1,1) (1,5) (5,1) (5,5) (3,3). The number of colored cells is 5. The horizontal and vertical can't be checked.

Let's try coloring cells in diagonal arrangement: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5). Every diagonal 1 x 4 is covered and also every 4x1 rectangle.

So, 5 is the right answer.
