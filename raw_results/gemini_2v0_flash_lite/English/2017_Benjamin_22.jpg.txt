Reasoning:
1. **Identify Matching Letters:** The key is to determine the numerical values of the letters. We can see that A in ABD, AHD, and HAB are locked by 124, 184, so the letter "A" must be 8. Thus, A = 8.
2. **Determine Other Letter Values:** Looking at DAD, D in DAD is locked by 412, so the letter "D" must be 4. Thus, D = 4. Looking at ABD, the key is 124. Since A=8, and D=4, then B must be 2. Therefore, B = 2.
3. **Solve for the Question Mark:** Now the padlock HAB should be solved with H. Because B=2 and A=8, then H=3. The answer key should therefore be 382.

Answer: A)
