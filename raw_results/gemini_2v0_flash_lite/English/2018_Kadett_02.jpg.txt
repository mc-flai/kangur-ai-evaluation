Reasoning:
The word "MAMA" has a vertical axis of symmetry when the letters are written vertically because the letters at top and bottom are the same, and the middle letter is in the middle.
We need to apply the same test for each word in the options.
*   **ADAM:** The word written vertically would be A/D/A/M. No axis of symmetry.
*   **BAUM:** The word written vertically would be B/A/U/M. No axis of symmetry.
*   **BOOT:** The word written vertically would be B/O/O/T. The two Os would create an axis of symmetry, but the B and T are not symmetric to each other.
*   **LOGO:** The word written vertically would be L/O/G/O. No axis of symmetry.
*   **TOTO:** The word written vertically would be T/O/T/O. The word has a vertical axis of symmetry because T and O are symmetrical.
