Reasoning: First, simplify the exponents: (2^22)^5 = 2^(22*5) = 2^110 and (5^55)^2 = 5^(55*2) = 5^110.  The expression is 2^110 * 5^110.  Combine using the rule a^n * b^n = (a*b)^n: (2*5)^110 = 10^110.  10^110 will have a 1 followed by 110 zeros.  The total number of digits is 110 + 1 = 111.

Answer: E)
