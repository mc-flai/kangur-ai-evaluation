Reasoning:
Let's denote Claudia's spending as C.
Bettina spends 85% less than Claudia, so Bettina spends 0.15C (100% - 85% = 15%).
Anna spends 60% more than Claudia, so Anna spends 1.6C (100% + 60% = 160%).
Together they spend 55 €, meaning: C + 0.15C + 1.6C = 55
2.75C = 55
C = 55 / 2.75 = 20
Anna spends 1.6C = 1.6 * 20 = 32 €.
