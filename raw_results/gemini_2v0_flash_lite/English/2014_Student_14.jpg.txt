Reasoning: We need to find whole number triples (a, b, c) such that a > b > c > 1 and (1/a) + (1/b) + (1/c) > 1.
Let's analyze possible values for c. Since a > b > c, the smallest possible value for c is 2.
If c = 2:  (1/a) + (1/b) > 1 - (1/2) = 1/2. Since b < a, 1/b > 1/a. The smallest possible value for b is 3 (because b > c = 2).
If b = 3: (1/a) + (1/3) > 1/2, so (1/a) > 1/2 - 1/3 = 1/6.  This means a < 6. Since a > b, we have possible values of a: 4, 5. So, triples are (4, 3, 2) and (5, 3, 2).
If c = 3: The smallest possible value for b is 4. (1/a) + (1/b) > 1 - (1/3) = 2/3
If b = 4 : (1/a) + (1/4) > 2/3, (1/a) > 2/3 - 1/4 = 5/12, which means a < 12/5 = 2.4. This is not possible as we require a > b.
If c >= 3, then b >= 4 and a >= 5.  The sum of reciprocals will be less than 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 = 47/60 < 1, hence no solutions exist when c >= 3.

We have found two solutions (4,3,2) and (5,3,2)

Answer: (C)
