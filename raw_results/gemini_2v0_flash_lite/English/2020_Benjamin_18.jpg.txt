Reasoning:
1.  **Identify the "duck" sticker:** While the sticker of a duck isn't explicitly present in the given images, we can understand that from the available choices. The question is asking which sticker is opposite to the duck.
2.  **Analyze the cube's two positions:** The two cube positions show the relative positions of the stickers. We can identify that the dog is on the same side of the cube as the mouse in the first position of the cube. In the second position, the dog and the fly appear to be next to each other, with the ladybug opposite the mouse.
3. **Deduction:** We can deduce that the duck must be opposite to the mouse, as we could see that in position one.
