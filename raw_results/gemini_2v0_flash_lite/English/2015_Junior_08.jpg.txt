Reasoning:
A square number is the result of squaring an integer (e.g. 4 = 2^2), and a cubic number is the result of cubing an integer (e.g. 8 = 2^3). We need to find the number which is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube. Let's check each option:

A) 6^13: Not a perfect square or cube (6 is not a perfect square or cube, and the exponent 13 is not divisible by 2 or 3).
B) 5^12: A perfect square (12 is divisible by 2) and a perfect cube (12 is divisible by 3) so it's both.
C) 4^11 = (2^2)^11 = 2^22: A perfect square, but not a perfect cube.
D) 3^10: A perfect square, but not a perfect cube.
E) 2^9: A perfect cube.

Therefore, 6^13 fits the condition.

Answer: A)
