Reasoning:
Let x be the number of twigs with 5 leaves and y be the number of twigs with 2 leaves.
We know x + y = 10 (total number of twigs).
The total number of leaves is given by 5x + 2y.
We can express y in terms of x: y = 10 - x.
Substituting into the total leaves equation: 5x + 2(10 - x) = 5x + 20 - 2x = 3x + 20.
Now let's test the options to see if the answer can be represented in the form 3x + 20, where x is an integer and 0 <= x <= 10.
(A) 45 = 3x + 20 => 3x = 25 => x = 25/3 (not an integer)
(B) 39 = 3x + 20 => 3x = 19 => x = 19/3 (not an integer)
(C) 37 = 3x + 20 => 3x = 17 => x = 17/3 (not an integer)
(D) 31 = 3x + 20 => 3x = 11 => x = 11/3 (not an integer)
Since none of the options provide an integer value for x, then the correct answer is (E).

Answer: E)
