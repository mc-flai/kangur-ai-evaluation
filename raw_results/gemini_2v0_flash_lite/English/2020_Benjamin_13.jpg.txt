Reasoning: Let B be the number of brown kangaroos and G be the number of gray kangaroos. We know that B + G = 2020.

Each kangaroo says "One of my neighbors is brown and the other is gray."
- A brown kangaroo is truthful. This means that the neighbors of a brown kangaroo must be gray, and brown, in some order.
- A gray kangaroo is a liar. This means that the neighbors of a gray kangaroo cannot have one neighbor brown, and one gray. The neighbors must be either both brown or both gray.

Consider a brown kangaroo. It tells the truth, so its neighbours must be one brown and one gray.
Consider a gray kangaroo. It lies, so its neighbors cannot be one brown and one gray. So either both its neighbors are brown or both are gray. But in a circle, it has two neighbours. So it is not possible to be entirely brown, or entirely grey. Because each neighbor has to be one brown and one gray.
Because of that, consider an alternating pattern, BGBGBGB...
The number of Brown will be equal or near to the Gray.
Since B + G = 2020. Assuming alternating pattern
B = G = 1010.

Answer: C)
