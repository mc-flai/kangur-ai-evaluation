Reasoning: A quadratic function has a parabolic shape.  Graphs (A), (C), and (E) are linear, and therefore represent a linear function rather than a quadratic function. (B) and (D) represent a part of a parabolic shape of a quadratic function. Since the question asks for the piece that *does not belong*, and (A), (C), and (E) do not represent parts of the parabola shape, the answer must be one of these. Comparing the linear graphs, we can say that (A), (C), and (E) could represent part of a single linear function, (A) has a positive slope while (C) and (E) have negative slopes. Therefore (A) has to be different.

Answer: A)
