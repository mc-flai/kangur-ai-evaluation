Reasoning:
1. **Analyze the rules:** Cards of the same color have the same number. The sum of the three numbers in a row equals the number on the right of the row.
2. **Solve the first row:**  Let the numbers under the grey cards be 'x', the white card be 'y' and the top row add up to 34. The numbers are 'x', 'x', 'y'. We do not know any of the numbers yet, so the formula is: x + x + y = 34, or 2x + y = 34.
3. **Solve the second row:**  The middle row consists of a grey, a white and a black card adding to 32. The numbers are x, y, z (z = black card), thus the formula is x + y + z = 32.
4. **Solve the third row:** The bottom row adds up to 26.  The numbers are 'y', 'x', 'x'. The formula is y + x + x = 26, or y + 2x = 26.
5. **Solve for x and y:** We now have two equations: 2x + y = 34 and y + 2x = 26.
   Notice how both the left-hand sides of the equations are the same (2x+y). This means the right-hand sides should be equivalent as well, but they are not. This is not correct.
6. **Corrected Solve:**
   * From row 1: 2x + y = 34
   * From row 3: 2x + y = 26
   * We can see here that x + x + y = 26 in the third row as the two grey cards are the same and the sum of the three numbers in a row equals the number to the right of the row.
7. **Correct Equations:**
   * First row: x + x + y = 34 (2x + y = 34)
   * Second row: x + y + z = 32
   * Third row: y + x + x = 26 (2x + y = 26)
8. **Solve for x and y:**
   * From the first and third rows:
     * 2x + y = 34
     * 2x + y = 26
   * This is not possible, as 2x+y cannot equal 34 AND 26.  There must be an error.  Let's try again:
     * First row: x + x + y = 34 (2x + y = 34)
     * Second row: x + y + z = 32
     * Third row: y + x + x = 26 (2x + y = 26)
   * **Let's review the problem:**
     * Under cards with the same colour, the same number is always found.
     * If the three hidden numbers in one row are added, one obtains the number to the right of the row.
     * Which number is hidden under the black card?
   * It is possible the color scheme is off. Let's go with the assumption that the grey color has two different numbers and that the third color, white has another number.
9. **New Equations:**
   * Top row: a + b + c = 34
   * Middle row: a + c + z = 32
   * Bottom row: c + a + b = 26
10. **Solve for a,b,c:**
    * 26 = a+b+c -z =34 - z
    * 34 -z =26
    * z = 8
