Reasoning:
The line must pass through the center of the circle, which is (75, 30). The line that divides the remaining part of the rectangle into two equal areas must also pass through the center of the rectangle. The center of the rectangle is at (50, 25). Thus, the line goes through points (75, 30) and (50, 25). The gradient is calculated as (change in y) / (change in x) = (30 - 25) / (75 - 50) = 5 / 25 = 1/5.

Answer: A)
