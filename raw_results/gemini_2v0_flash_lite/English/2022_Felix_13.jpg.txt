Reasoning: The problem states that the sum of the numbers in the five circles around each house is 20. For the house on the right, the sum of the known numbers is 3 + 1 = 4. We know that two circles share a number. This means that the numbers on the right are 3, ?, 1, and 2. Given that the total has to be 20, that would mean that the numbers around the house on the right must sum to 20. We know the numbers are 3, 1 and the shared number must be 2, which totals 6, that means that the number in the question mark is 20-6 = 14.
