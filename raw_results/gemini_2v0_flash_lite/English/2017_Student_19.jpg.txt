Reasoning: In a convex quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals, let the intersection point of the diagonals be O. Then, triangles AOB, BOC, COD, and DOA are right-angled triangles. We have AB = 2017, BC = 2018, and CD = 2019. We need to find AD.  Applying the Pythagorean theorem to the four triangles, we have: AO^2 + BO^2 = AB^2 = 2017^2, BO^2 + CO^2 = BC^2 = 2018^2, CO^2 + DO^2 = CD^2 = 2019^2, and DO^2 + AO^2 = AD^2. Adding the first and third equations gives: AO^2 + BO^2 + CO^2 + DO^2 = 2017^2 + 2019^2.  Adding the second and fourth equations gives: BO^2 + CO^2 + DO^2 + AO^2 = 2018^2 + AD^2. Equating these two gives: 2017^2 + 2019^2 = 2018^2 + AD^2,  so  AD^2 = 2017^2 + 2019^2 - 2018^2.  We can rewrite this as AD^2 = (2018-1)^2 + (2018+1)^2 - 2018^2 = (2018^2 - 2*2018 + 1) + (2018^2 + 2*2018 + 1) - 2018^2 = 2018^2 + 2. Thus, AD = sqrt(2018^2 + 2).
