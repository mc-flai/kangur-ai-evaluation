Reasoning:
Let 'x' be the number of compartments in each carriage.
Mike is in the 3rd carriage and in the 18th compartment. Therefore, the first 2 carriages have 2*x compartments, and the third carriage has compartments up to the 18th. Therefore, 2x < 18 <= 3x, and the compartments of the first 2 carriages is 18 - (3 -1) * x or 2 * x. Since Mike is in the 18th compartment, 2*x + (Mike’s position)
18 = 2x + (Mike’s carriage number - 1) * x
18 = 2x + (3-1) * x
Joanna is in the 7th carriage and in the 50th compartment. Therefore, 50th compartment = compartments up to 6th carriages + the compartments in 7th carriage:
50 = 6x + (Joanna's carriage number-1) * x
50 = 6x + 7th carriage
Since the number of compartment of the 7th carriage is the same, (50 - (7-1) * x)
50 = 6 * x + compartments in the 7th carriage. Therefore x must be:
(50 - 6x)/ 7th carraige
Let number of compartments be c
Mike:
3rd carriage:  (3-1)*c + a =18, where a is number of compartment in 3rd carriage and a =< c
2c+ a = 18 => 2c<18 as a must be < c
Joanna:
7th carriage: (7-1)*c + b = 50, where b <=c
6c + b =50 => 6c <50

If x=7:
2*7+a=18 -> a=4
6*7 + b =50 => b=8 - this doesn't work because 8 > 7
If x=8
2*8+a = 18 => a=2
6*8+b=50 => b= 2
x=8 is the answer.

Answer: B)
