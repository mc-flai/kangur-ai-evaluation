Reasoning: The area of each original square page is 4. From the left-hand diagram, each square has area 1, and each triangle is half of a square, therefore has an area of 0.5. Counting the pieces in the shape in the right-hand diagram: there are 2 squares, so their combined area is 2 * 1 = 2. There are 8 triangles, and the area is therefore 8 * 0.5 = 4. The total area is 2 + 4 = 6.

Answer: E)
