Reasoning:
1. Calculate the total muffins eaten: 12 girls * 1.5 muffins/girl = 18 muffins.
2. Two girls ate 0 muffins, meaning those muffins were not counted in the 18 total.
3. Let 'x' be the number of girls who ate 2 muffins.  The remaining girls ate either 1 muffin or 0 muffins.
4. The number of girls that ate muffins at all must be 12-2 = 10 girls
5.  We can write the equation: 2x + (10-x) * 1 + (2*0)= 18, x being the number of girls that ate 2 muffins, (10-x) the girls that ate 1 muffin, and the 2 girls that ate 0 muffins. Simplifying this we get x+10 = 18; x= 8.
6. Verify: 8 girls * 2 muffins + 2 girls * 0 muffins+ 2 girls * 0 muffins = 16, 10 girls ate 1 muffin which brings our total to 2*8+2=18.
7. Therefore, x = 8 girls ate 2 muffins.
8. 8 girls * 2 muffins = 16
9. 10 girls ate 1 muffin bring our total up to 16+2=18.
10. 18/12= 1.5 as stated.
