Reasoning: We are given that b = c * e, d = a + b and a = e - d.  Since a = e - d, we have e = a + d.  Substituting this into the equation for d gives d = a + b. Since all numbers are positive, and d = a + b, we can infer that d must be larger than both a and b. Next, we can rearrange a = e - d  to get  e = a + d. Since both a and d are positive, e must be larger than both a and d. Therefore, e must be the largest.

Answer: E)
