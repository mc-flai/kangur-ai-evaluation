Reasoning: Let the side length of the square be s. Then the area of the square is s^2 = 20, so s = sqrt(20). Since the square's side is along the side of the rectangle and two vertices are on the circle, and the circle is tangent to one side of the rectangle and passes through two of its vertices, then the side length of the square equals the width of the rectangle. Also, the diameter of the circle is equal to the length of the rectangle. The square is at the top part of the rectangle and is inside the circle. Let the radius of the circle be r. The diagonal of the square forms a right triangle with the other two sides of the square. The diagonal of the square is also the diameter of the circle which is the same as the length of the rectangle. Thus, the length of the rectangle is the diagonal of the square. Let's find the diagonal of the square. The length of the diagonal = sqrt(s^2 + s^2) = sqrt(20 + 20) = sqrt(40). Hence, the length of the rectangle = sqrt(40) and the width of the rectangle = sqrt(20). The area of the rectangle is then length * width = sqrt(40) * sqrt(20) = sqrt(800) = sqrt(400 * 2) = 20*sqrt(2).
However, the solution should lead to one of the options (A, B, C, D, or E). There seems to be a misunderstanding about the information of the circle. Let's go back to where the circle is tangent. The side of the square, sqrt(20), is also the side of the rectangle and it's a radius to the tangent point. The other side of the rectangle can be calculated by the fact that two vertices of the rectangle also lie on the circle. Given that the square has two corners on the circumference of the circle, we know that the diagonal of the square must be the diameter of the circle. We also know that the diameter of the circle is equal to the length of the rectangle. The diagonal of the square is sqrt(20 + 20) = sqrt(40). The length is thus sqrt(40) and the width of the rectangle = sqrt(20). Thus the area is sqrt(40) * sqrt(20) = sqrt(800), which is not one of the provided answers. The diagonal of the square is equal to the length of the rectangle. The length of the side of the square is sqrt(20). The width of the rectangle is the same side length of the square, sqrt(20). The side touching the circle is thus 2r - sqrt(20), and 2r = sqrt(40).
If we instead assume that the side touching the circle is r, then the radius would be 2r. If we assume the width of the rectangle equals sqrt(20), then the length is sqrt(20) + sqrt(20) = 2sqrt(20), then the area will be (sqrt(20) + sqrt(20)) * sqrt(20) = 40.
Area of rectangle = length * width. The width of the rectangle is the side of the square = sqrt(20). If the diameter of the circle is sqrt(40), then we can decompose the rectangle to sqrt(20) + sqrt(20). But we also know the area of the square is 20, which means width is sqrt(20). Then since the circle passes the other two vertices of the square, that is the diagonal of the square is the diameter of the circle. So we have a square of side sqrt(20) on top, and the circle diameter as the length. the length is then sqrt(40) and the width is sqrt(20). Then area is sqrt(40)*sqrt(20) = sqrt(800), not an option.
If we let the side be s, the width of the rectangle is s. The length is 2s. Area = 2s^2 = 2 * 20 = 40.
