Reasoning:
1.  **Analyze the first scale:**  2 hexagons = 1 triangle + 2 squares.
2.  **Analyze the second scale:**  2 triangles + 1 hexagon = 5 squares.
3.  **Focus on the third scale:** 3 hexagons = ? + 2 triangles. We want to find what is needed on the left side to balance the scales.
4.  **Substitute and solve:**  From the first scale, 2 hexagons is equivalent to 1 triangle + 2 squares. So, 3 hexagons is equivalent to (2 hexagons + 1 hexagon) = (1 triangle + 2 squares + 1 hexagon). The third scale shows 3 hexagons, which means (1 triangle + 2 squares + 1 hexagon).
5.  **Re-arrange to solve for the third scale:** We want to find how many objects are needed for the third scale.  We can use the second scale, since 2 triangles + 1 hexagon = 5 squares. Substitute 5 squares for 2 triangles + 1 hexagon in our previous formula, then we get that the third scale should be (5 squares + 2 squares), meaning that the left side of the third scale should be 2 squares.
