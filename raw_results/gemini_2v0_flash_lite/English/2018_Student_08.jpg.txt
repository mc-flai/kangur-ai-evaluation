Reasoning: To guarantee at least one white ball is drawn, consider the worst-case scenario: all black balls are drawn first before any white balls. There are 65 - 8 = 57 black balls. In each draw, up to 5 balls can be taken out. To get all the black balls, the minimum number of draws needed is 57 / 5 = 11.4. We must round this up to the nearest whole number to account for the worst-case scenario and the question's requirement. So, after 12 draws, we have drawn all the black balls. The next draw would be a white ball. Hence, we need at most 12 + 1 draws. However, since we can only draw at most 5 balls at a time, we need to compute the number of draws to draw the 57 black balls. Since each draw can get us 5 balls and we will take the ceiling of the result, we have ⌈57/5⌉= 12 draws. This is the number of draws we need to ensure we only have black balls, hence, the next draw, after the 12 draws, must give a white ball.

The last draw will reveal white balls. To guarantee one white ball, we need at least 12 draws (to take out all the black balls), plus one more draw to get a white ball. However, we are told we can take up to 5 balls at a time, so we need to make at least 13 draws to ensure that a white ball is drawn. It is not possible to guarantee 12 draws.
