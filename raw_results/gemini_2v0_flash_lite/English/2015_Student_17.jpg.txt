Reasoning: Let A and B be the populations of Arnberg and Berghausen, respectively, 20 years ago.
After 20 years, the population of Arnberg is 1.4A and the population of Berghausen is 1.6B.
The total population 20 years ago was A + B. The total population now is 1.54(A + B).
Thus, 1.4A + 1.6B = 1.54(A + B).
Simplifying the equation:
1.  4A + 1.6B = 1.54A + 1.54B
2.  6B - 1.54B = 1.54A - 1.4A
3.  0.06B = 0.14A
4.  B/A = 0.14/0.06 = 14/6 = 7/3.
5.  A/B = 3/7

Answer: C)
