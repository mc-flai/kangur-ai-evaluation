Reasoning:
1. **Children in Robert's row:** There are 2 children to the left of Robert, 3 to the right, and Robert himself, so there are 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 children in Robert's row.
2. **Number of rows:** There are 2 rows in front of Robert, 1 row behind him, and Robert's row, totaling 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 rows.
3. **Total children:** Since each row has the same number of children (6), and there are 4 rows, the total number of children is 6 * 4 = 24.
