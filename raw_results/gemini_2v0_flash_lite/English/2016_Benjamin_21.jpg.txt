Reasoning: The shape in the diagram appears to be a larger triangle composed of smaller identical triangles. To determine the minimum number of triangles needed to complete the large triangle, one must first identify the pattern of the small triangles. Counting the number of small triangles that are already present, we can determine what's missing to complete the largest, complete triangles. In this case, we can consider a larger triangle made up of 3 rows and 3 elements in the bottom row. The picture consists of 7 small triangles already in place. Counting them, we have 3 rows of triangles of 1, 2, and 3 triangles. A triangle of size 3 would have 6 triangles. The shape in the image is 7 triangles and we see that a triangle of size 4 would have 10 triangles. A triangle of size 5 would have 15 triangles. We have to add 15-7 = 8 additional triangles. If the larger triangle is composed of 4 rows, the shape can have 10 triangles and will need 10 - 7 = 3 additional triangles, but such an option isn't available. 9 triangles is available and requires adding 2 more triangles. We need to form a triangle. With 7, we can complete triangles of size 3, which consists of 6 triangles. We need to add 3 triangles to form 10, another triangle. The available numbers are 5, 9, 12, 15, and 19. If we want to form a triangle of size 4, then we will need to add 3 more triangles. We can construct a size 5 triangle by adding 8 more triangles. However, if we have a size 3 triangle, the number will be 6 triangles, and we'd need to add 1 more triangle. Then, add the shape that consists of 3 triangles in the bottom row, 2 triangles in the second row and 1 triangle in the last row, adding up to 6 triangles. But 7 triangles have been assembled. We can assemble the 5 or 9 triangles from the options. Adding 9 triangles will complete a size 5 triangle. The answer is 9 because the question asked the minimum number of triangles, which requires us to complete the size 4 triangle by adding 3 more triangles. We can instead choose the size 5 triangle by adding 8 triangles. However, we need the minimum, which would add 2 triangles to arrive at 9 triangles.

Answer: B)
