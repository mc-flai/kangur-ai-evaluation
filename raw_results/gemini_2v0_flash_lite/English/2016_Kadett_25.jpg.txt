Reasoning:
Let's assume the initial grey cube is in the corner.
Day 1: The corner cube has 3 neighbors. So, 1 (initial grey) + 3 = 4 grey cubes.
Day 2:
- The 3 cubes colored in Day 1:
  - One of them is on an edge: It will have 4 neighbors which will be newly grey (excluding the initial grey cube and two cubes that have already been colored in day one)
  - Two of them are on a face: each of them will have 5 neighbors which will be newly grey (excluding the initial grey and one cube that has already been colored in day one)
- The other cases are: one cube in the corner is neighboured to the first grey one (day one) and have 4 neighbors in day two, and two of them are neighbours to the first grey one (day one) and have 5 neighbours in day two
So, a total of 1+3+4+5 = 13 cubes in Day 2. In the question there are no additional information about the location of the original grey cube and thus assuming it is in the middle we can get more cubes colored in day 2, so, it is important to analyze it starting from the corner, because that is the case where the maximum cubes are the ones colored in day two.
So: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13
