Reasoning: The visible cube is a 3x3x3 cube, so there are a total of 27 cubes.  The problem states that white and colored cubes are used in equal amounts. Count the visible colored cubes. There are 9 colored cubes. Therefore, there are 9 white cubes in total. In the picture, we can see 5 white cubes. The number of cubes that cannot be seen is the difference between the total and the visible white cubes.
27 total cubes - 9 colored cubes = 18 white cubes total
18 white cubes / 2 = 9 cubes
9 total white cubes - 5 visible white cubes = 4 hidden white cubes.
