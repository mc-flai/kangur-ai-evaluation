Reasoning: The cake is divided into four pieces, and the biggest piece weighs the same as the other three pieces combined. Let x be the weight of the biggest piece. Then the total weight of the cake is x + x = 2x. We know the cake weighs 900g, so 2x = 900g. Solving for x, we get x = 900g / 2 = 450g.
