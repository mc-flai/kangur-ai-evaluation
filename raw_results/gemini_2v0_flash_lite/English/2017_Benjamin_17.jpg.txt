Reasoning: The small cube has two shaded faces that meet at a corner. The large cube must have 9 of these, each in the same orientation. We can eliminate choices based on the arrangement of the shaded squares. For a 3x3x3 cube, we are looking for a combination of the blocks that doesn't have any "missing" squares.

Looking at the options:
*   **A:** Has 9 blocks, and all the gray blocks can have the same orientation as the original.
*   **B:** Has 9 blocks, but the gray blocks do not align with the orientation shown.
*   **C:** Has 9 blocks, but the gray blocks do not align with the orientation shown.
*   **D:** Has 9 blocks, but the gray blocks do not align with the orientation shown.
*   **E:** Has 9 blocks, but the gray blocks do not align with the orientation shown.

Answer: A)
