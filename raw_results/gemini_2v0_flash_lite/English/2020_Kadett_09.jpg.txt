Reasoning: The sum of the first row is 1 + 2 + 6 = 9. Therefore, the sum of each row and each column must be 9.  The first column is 1 + 3 = 4, so the third number in that column must be 5 to total 9. In the second column, there must be a 4 since 2 + 4 + 3 = 9. The third column, with a 6 and 5, requires a -2 to achieve a sum of 9, but we know that Juca wrote a whole number greater than zero in each of the boxes. However, that is not the case, and in the question's conditions, three numbers are not repeated. This helps in getting to the final answer.

Answer: C)
