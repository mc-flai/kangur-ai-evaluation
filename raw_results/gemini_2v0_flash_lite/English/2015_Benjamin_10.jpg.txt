Reasoning:
1.  **Calculate the length of one strip:** When gluing two strips with a 10cm overlap, the result is 50cm. This can be represented as: Strip Length + Strip Length - Overlap = Total Length. Thus: 2 * Strip Length - 10 cm = 50 cm.  Solving for Strip Length: 2 * Strip Length = 60 cm, so Strip Length = 30 cm.
2.  **Calculate the overlap for the 56cm strip:** For the second pair, we want a 56cm strip. Thus: Strip Length + Strip Length - Overlap = Total Length. Substituting: 30 cm + 30 cm - Overlap = 56 cm. Thus, 60 cm - Overlap = 56 cm. Solving for the Overlap: Overlap = 60 cm - 56 cm, so the Overlap = 4 cm.
