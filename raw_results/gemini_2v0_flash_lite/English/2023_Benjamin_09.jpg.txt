Reasoning: The question asks which picture cannot be obtained by placing the given paper pieces on top of a black circle. We have two grey semi-circles and a white semi-circle. The black part of the circle is the base. Now let's analyze each option:
*   **(A):** Has a similar area for the grey pieces. This arrangement could be possible.
*   **(B):** Has a smaller black section. This also seems possible.
*   **(C):** Has a single large grey section, a smaller grey section and a white section. This is possible.
*   **(D):** Two grey sections are similar, and the other section is white. It also appears to be possible.
*   **(E):** Has a smaller white section. This arrangement could be possible.
Analyzing each option, we see that options (A, B, C, D and E) could be possible. However, if the options are analyzed from the perspective of the two grey halves and white half only (without a base) then only one option is not obtainable.
So, based on the given paper pieces (two grey and one white), it's tricky. Options A, B, C, D can be obtained but the shape of E is not obtainable.

Answer: E)
