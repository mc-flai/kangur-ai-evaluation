Reasoning:
The rule states that connected circles cannot be the same color. We need to find which two circles *must* be the same color. Let's analyze the provided options:

*   **(A) 5 and 8:**  Circles 5 and 8 are not directly connected, and don't share any connections to the same circles. They *could* be different colors.
*   **(B) 1 and 6:** If we color 1, 2, and 5 with different colours, then 6 needs to have the same color as 1.
*   **(C) 2 and 7:** 2 and 7 can be different colors, depending on the colors assigned to circles 6, 2, and 5.
*   **(D) 4 and 5:** Circles 4 and 5 can be colored differently.
*   **(E) 3 and 6:** Circles 3 and 6 can be different colors.

Specifically, let's look at option B:
If circle 1 is blue, circle 2 could be red, circle 5 could be yellow, and circle 6 would have to be blue because it is connected to both 2 and 5 (not being the same color), therefore it would have the same color as 1.

Answer: B)
