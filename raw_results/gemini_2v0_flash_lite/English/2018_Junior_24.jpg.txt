Reasoning: The problem describes an annulus formed by two concentric circles with radii 1 and 9. Smaller circles are drawn inside the annulus, touching both the inner and outer circles. The question asks for the maximum number of these smaller circles that can fit without overlapping.  Consider the cross-section of the annulus and the smaller circles. If you draw a line segment through the center of the annulus, each smaller circle will have its center on this line, and each smaller circle will have a radius of (9-1)/2 = 4. The distance between the centers of adjacent smaller circles must be at least twice the radius, which is 2r = 8. The smaller circle can be arranged symmetrically around the center. We can fit a total of 3 such circles (n=3) into the annulus, and that would be the largest possible number.
