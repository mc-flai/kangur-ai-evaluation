Reasoning: The lock initially displayed 6348. The brother turned each part the same amount in the same direction to get the new combination. We need to figure out which of the given options CANNOT be the starting combination. We can test each option by figuring out how many turns it takes to get to 6348.

A) If the original combination was 8560, we'd have to turn it: 8 -> 6 (turn back 2), 5->3 (turn back 2), 6->4 (turn back 2), 0->8 (turn back 2), This is possible.

B) If the original combination was 3015, we'd have to turn it: 3->6 (turn forward 3), 0->3 (turn forward 3), 1->4 (turn forward 3), 5->8 (turn forward 3). This is possible.

C) If the original combination was 4906, we'd have to turn it: 4->6 (turn forward 2), 9->3 (turn back 6), 0->4 (turn forward 4), 6->8 (turn forward 2). This is impossible because it isn't the same number of turns for each part.

D) If the original combination was 1893, we'd have to turn it: 1->6 (turn forward 5), 8->3 (turn back 5), 9->4 (turn back 5), 3->8 (turn forward 5). This is possible.

E) If the original combination was 0782, we'd have to turn it: 0->6 (turn forward 6), 7->3 (turn back 4), 8->4 (turn back 4), 2->8 (turn forward 6). This is impossible because it isn't the same number of turns for each part.

Since the turns must be the same in each part, we can rule out C and E as possible starting combinations. Since the question asks which CANNOT be the starting combination, we choose C.

Answer: C)
