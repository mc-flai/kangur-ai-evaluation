Reasoning: Let the original fraction be N/D. The new fraction is (1.4N) / (D - x% of D). We want the new fraction to be double the original fraction, so (1.4N) / (D - (x/100)D) = 2(N/D).  Simplifying, 1.4N * D = 2N * (D - (x/100)D).  Dividing both sides by ND: 1.4 = 2(1 - x/100).  Divide both sides by 2: 0.7 = 1 - x/100.  Then x/100 = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3, so x = 30.
