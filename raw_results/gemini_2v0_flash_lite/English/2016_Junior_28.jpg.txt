Reasoning: The question provides multiple clues, but none of them directly tells us the sport Eva does.
*   "The person who skies sits to the left of Sandra" - Tells us about skiing and Sandra, but not Eva.
*   "The person who ice skates sits opposite Benjamin" - Tells us about ice skating and Benjamin, but not Eva.
*   "Eva and Philipp sit next to each other" - Tells us about Eva and Phillip.
*   "A woman sits next to the person who plays hockey" - Tells us about a woman and hockey.

The clues together only allow us to deduce some of the seating arrangements and sports, but not what sport Eva does.

Answer: E)
