Reasoning: The water levels are the same height in both glasses, and the glasses are identical, meaning the volume of water is the same in each. The volume of water in the upright glass is a cylinder. Let the height of the water be 'h'. The area of the base is given as $3\pi$. Therefore, the volume of water is area of base $\times$ height, which equals $3\pi h$. The diagram shows the slanted glass, the shaded portion. The volume is equal to the volume of the other glass. The volume of water in the leaning glass is calculated by using the area and height. Since the area of the base is the same and the water height is also the same, the volume of water should be the same. From the image we can see that the volume of water is equal to the height. Since water touches the bottom in exactly one point, the height is going to be 2r, or the diameter of the base. Since the area of the base is $3\pi$, this means that $\pi r^2 = 3\pi$, so $r^2 = 3$, and $r = \sqrt{3}$. The diameter of the base is $2\sqrt{3}$, but the height of the water is such that the total height, in the upright glass, is twice the value of r (equal to a diameter), so the water has height h. In the leaned glass, the volume of water is equivalent to a "slice" from a cylinder. Because the water touches only one point on the bottom, we infer that the "slice" is removed from half of the cylinder. The shaded area is that half of the cylinder. The volume would be half the cylinder if the height in the upright glass is the diameter of the base. We have a volume equals $\pi r^2 \times h$. We have $r^2$ = 3 from the question information, so the volume is equal to $3\pi h$. Because the height is $2r$, we can say that the height is $2\sqrt{3}$. The water in the leaning glass has the same volume, thus each one contains $3\pi \times 2\sqrt{3}$, which is the total volume. The water is split between the same glasses. The water level in both glasses is at the same height. Looking at the figure, the leaning glass has the same amount of water as the upright. We know that $A = 3\pi cm^2$. Since the glasses are identical and the water level is the same, this means that the volume of water in each glass is the same, so $V=A\times h$ where h is the height of water. The height of the water in the upright glass is such that the area of water covers the area of the base. Given the drawing, the slanted glass has water with the same volume, so h=2r. Since A = $3\pi$, then $r^2\pi = 3\pi$ so $r = \sqrt{3}$.  So $h = 2r = 2\sqrt{3}$. The water level, thus volume is $3\pi\times 2\sqrt{3} cm^3$, but this is not correct and the question says volume. However we need to find the volume for each of the glasses. Since both glasses have the same amount of water, we can observe in the diagram that the volume of water should be of the same height of a cylinder. So the volume will equal the area of base times height, and we know from the question. We know that the area is $3\pi$, since the height of the liquid is equal to the diameter of the base, i.e, $2r$, where the area is equal to $\pi r^2$, we know that $r^2 = 3$, then r =$\sqrt{3}$ So $2\sqrt{3}$, however the question asks how much water is in each glass, The question states that the bases are 3$\pi$. Then, the height is same. From the image of the second glass, we understand that the volume should be the area of the circle times the height.  Since the total volume is the same, we can deduce that in the upright glass, the volume of water will be equal to 6$\pi$.
