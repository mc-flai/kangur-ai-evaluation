Reasoning: We are looking for the number of ways to select three distinct digits a, b, and c (from 0-9), such that the condition  ab < bc < ca is satisfied.  Here 'ab' represents the two-digit number 10a + b, 'bc' represents 10b + c, and 'ca' represents 10c + a.  We can choose 3 distinct digits from 10 digits in 10C3 = 120 ways.  For any set of three distinct digits, there is only one arrangement that will satisfy the required condition. For example if the three numbers chosen are 1, 2, 3 and a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 gives us: 12 < 23 < 31.  If we pick the digits in any other order, the condition fails. Thus, we simply need to consider the number of ways we can choose the three digits: 10C3 = 10! / (3! * 7!) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 120. However, if the number zero is one of the digits, then a cannot be 0. However, for digits 0, 1, and 2, the digits can be arranged such that ab < bc < ca i.e. 10 < 02 < 21 which simplifies to 10 < 2 < 21, which isn't correct. Therefore, we need to calculate the number of ways the digits are chosen excluding zero.
Then, number of ways of choosing three digits from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} is 9C3 = 9! / (3! * 6!) = (9 * 8 * 7) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 84
Number of ways to choose three digits where 0 is selected = 9C2 = 36 ways. Then we have the following condition, for example {0, 1, 2}:  a, b, c and we must choose such that ab < bc < ca. Then the only possible solution here is: 10 < 02 < 21, which is invalid. Thus, we subtract 0 from the possible values to make the condition work.
Thus we get 84 ways.
