Reasoning: Let the six-digit number be $N = 2ABCDE$. We are given that $3N = ABCDE2$. We can rewrite $N$ as $200000 + x$, where $x = ABCDE$. The result can be written as $10x + 2$. So, we have $3(200000 + x) = 10x + 2$. This simplifies to $600000 + 3x = 10x + 2$. Subtracting $3x$ from both sides and subtracting 2 from both sides gives $599998 = 7x$. Thus, $x = \frac{599998}{7} = 85714$. Therefore, $N = 285714$.
The sum of the digits is $2+8+5+7+1+4 = 27$.
