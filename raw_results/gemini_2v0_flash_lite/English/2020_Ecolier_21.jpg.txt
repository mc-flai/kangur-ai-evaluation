Reasoning: Let T be the sum of the numbers covered by triangles, S be the sum of numbers covered by squares, and C be the number covered by the circle. The problem states that T = S and C = T/4. Since the numbers are 1 to 8, the sum of all the numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 36. Since T + S + C = 36, and T = S, we have 2T + C = 36. Also, C = T/4, so we can substitute C in the previous equation: 2T + T/4 = 36. Multiplying both sides by 4, we get 8T + T = 144, so 9T = 144. Dividing by 9 gives T = 16. Since C = T/4, then C = 16/4 = 4. The question asks for the sum of the numbers covered with triangles and the circle, which is T + C = 16 + 4 = 20.

Answer: C)
