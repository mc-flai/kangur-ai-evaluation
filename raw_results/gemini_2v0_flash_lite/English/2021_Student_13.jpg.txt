Reasoning: Let the three-digit number be $abc$, which can be written as $100a + 10b + c$. The reversed number is $cba$, which can be written as $100c + 10b + a$. According to the problem, the reversed number is 99 more than the original number, so $100c + 10b + a = 100a + 10b + c + 99$. This simplifies to $99c - 99a = 99$, or $c - a = 1$, so $c = a + 1$. Since the number is a three-digit number, $a$ must be at least 1 and at most 8 (because $c$ must be at most 9). The digit $b$ can take any value from 0 to 9. Therefore, for each possible value of $a$ from 1 to 8, there are 10 possible values for $b$. For each value of $a$ and $b$, the value of $c$ is uniquely determined by the equation $c = a+1$. So, there are 8 possible values for $a$, 10 possible values for $b$, and 1 value for $c$ for each choice of $a$. The total number of three-digit numbers satisfying the given condition is $8 \times 10 = 80$.
