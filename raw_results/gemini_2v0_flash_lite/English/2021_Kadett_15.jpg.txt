Reasoning: The problem describes two types of stars that can be formed using identical right-angled triangles. The first star, formed by arranging the larger acute angles to touch, uses 5 triangles. The second star is formed by arranging the smaller acute angles to touch. The total degrees in a circle is 360. Since there are 5 triangles in the first star, the larger acute angle of each triangle is 360/5 = 72 degrees. The other two angles of each triangle will be 90 degrees and 180 - 90 - 72 = 18 degrees. The smaller acute angle is 18 degrees. Therefore, the number of triangles in the second star will be 360 / 18 = 20.
