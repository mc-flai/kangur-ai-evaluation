Reasoning:
1.  **Line r:** The equation is y = ax + b. Since the line r is horizontal, its slope, *a*, must be 0. The y-intercept, *b*, is positive (above the x-axis).
2.  **Line s:** The equation is y = cx + d. The line s has a positive slope, so *c* > 0. The y-intercept, *d*, is negative (below the x-axis).
3.  **Evaluate the options:**
    *   **(A) ab + cd < 0:**  Since a = 0, this simplifies to cd < 0. Because c > 0 and d < 0, cd < 0. This statement is true.
    *   **(B) a + b + c + d < 0:**  This is not necessarily true, since we only know that a=0, b>0, c>0, and d<0.
    *   **(C) ac + bd ≥ 0:**  Since a = 0, this simplifies to bd ≥ 0.  Since b > 0 and d < 0, bd < 0. This statement is false.
    *   **(D) a + b + c + d > 0:**  This is not necessarily true. We only know that a=0, b>0, c>0 and d<0.
    *   **(E) abcd > 0:** Since a = 0, abcd = 0. This statement is false.
