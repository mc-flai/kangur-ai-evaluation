Reasoning: The sequence provided consists of consecutive two-digit numbers. The symbols represent digits. We need to identify the next term in the sequence. We are given:
*   □◊
*   ♡∆
*   ♡□

Since the sequence is increasing, and all three numbers are two digit numbers, we assume that the first digits correspond, the first digit increases from a shape to another.

Let's assume that the first number represents a two-digit number, the second a two-digit number, and the third a two-digit number.
The first digit in the sequence is changing: square, heart, heart.  Since the numbers are in increasing order, the next number must start with a heart, so we need to find the next value for the second digit.

Considering that the first and second numbers are consecutive, the shape after the square is a heart.

Then the pattern is :
□◊
♡∆
♡□
The correct answer should be "heart diamond"
