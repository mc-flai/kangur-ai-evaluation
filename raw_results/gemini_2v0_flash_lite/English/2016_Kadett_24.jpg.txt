Reasoning: Let's work backward. The basket is empty after the third grandmother. Each grandmother receives the same number of waffles. Let's denote the amount each grandmother gets as 'x'. Before the third grandmother, the wolf ate half, so there were 2x waffles. Before the second grandmother, the wolf ate half, so there were 2 * 2x = 4x waffles. Before the first grandmother, the wolf ate half, so there were 2 * 4x = 8x waffles. The original number of waffles was 8x. Since the amount of waffles must be divisible by 8 and each grandmother must receive a whole number of waffles. Considering the options 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9, we can infer the original number is divisible by at least the smallest denominator that guarantees each grandmother gets a whole number of waffles. The amount can be divided by the number 8 * x. Since each grandmother gets the same number of waffles, the number must be divisible by 3, and the number must be a multiple of 8. Then the original number of waffles must be divided by 8x, the wolf takes half each time, so it must be a power of 2. Then the possible amounts per grandmother are divisible by 8, because the initial amount must be divisible by 8 (2 * 2 * 2, as the wolf halves each time). Therefore, a number like 6 is not possible because it's not a multiple of 8, thus the original number of waffles can be divisible by 4, 6 is possible, but not guaranteed. Therefore the number of waffles can be divisible by 6, is not the answer. If we take the total amount of waffles and divide by 3, then to have x waffles, the initial amount is 8x. If each one has to have whole numbers, then x must be an integer, and 8x can be divided by 4, 6 is not possible.

Answer: C)
