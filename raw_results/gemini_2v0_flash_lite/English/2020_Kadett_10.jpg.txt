Reasoning:
1.  **Analyze the figure**: The figure is composed of a square and an equilateral triangle.
2.  **Identify known angles**:
    *   In the square, all angles are 90 degrees.
    *   In the equilateral triangle, all angles are 60 degrees.
3.  **Analyze the options**:
    *   **(A) a = d**: 'a' is formed by the angle of the square and angle from the equilateral triangle (90-60), so a is 30 degrees,  'd' is formed by subtracting angles, from the 90 degrees of the square with the 60 degrees of the equilateral triangle, so d is 30 degrees. This is correct.
    *   **(B) b + c = d**: 'b' and 'c' are angles inside the equilateral triangle, so b = 60 degrees and c is part of a square and part of a equilateral triangle, since the angle c must be 30 degrees. Then b + c is not equal to d.
    *   **(C) a + c = d + e**: We already know a = d (30 degrees) and that e is a 90 degrees, so c is 30, then this is not correct.
    *   **(D) a + b = d + e**: a is 30 and b is 60, d is 30 and e is not correct.
    *   **(E) e + d = a**: This is not correct.
4.  **Confirm the correct answer**: Option (A) a = d correctly reflects the relationship between the angles.
