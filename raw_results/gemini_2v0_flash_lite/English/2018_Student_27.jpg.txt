Reasoning: We need to find the number of real solutions for the equation ||4^x - 3| - 2| = 1.  We consider two cases:
Case 1: |4^x - 3| - 2 = 1
|4^x - 3| = 3
This leads to two subcases:
Subcase 1a: 4^x - 3 = 3 => 4^x = 6.  x = log_4(6) (one solution)
Subcase 1b: 4^x - 3 = -3 => 4^x = 0.  No solution since 4^x is always positive.

Case 2: |4^x - 3| - 2 = -1
|4^x - 3| = 1
This leads to two subcases:
Subcase 2a: 4^x - 3 = 1 => 4^x = 4.  x = 1 (one solution)
Subcase 2b: 4^x - 3 = -1 => 4^x = 2.  x = log_4(2) = 1/2 (one solution)

In total, there are three real solutions:  x = log_4(6), x = 1, and x = 1/2.

Answer: (B)
