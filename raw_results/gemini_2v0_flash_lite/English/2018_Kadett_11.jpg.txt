Reasoning: The equation is of the form _3 x 2_ = 32. We need to determine the missing digits.  Since we are multiplying by a number ending in 2, the result needs to end in an even number. Testing different values for the missing digit in the first factor, the most obvious combination that works is 13 x 2 = 26, which has a total of 1+6=7 painted digits, not an available answer. Testing 14 * 2 = 28, not 32. Next, we need to consider a product that starts with 32, but the question implies that this is not true. If the first number is 14, then 14 * 2 = 28 which gives 2 + 8 = 10. This is not an answer choice.  If the first number is 16, then 16*2 = 32 and this checks out. Therefore, the digits covered are 1, 6, and the value 1+6+0 = 7 which is not a choice. Re-examining, this could be 16 * 2 = 32, then the digits painted over are the '1' in the first number and the 0 in the result, so it sums up 1+0 = 1 which is not the choice. Considering 13 * 2 = 26, the number is 1x2, so x cannot be 3. So we should try another combination, which should be **16*2 = 32**, as this fits into the 1_ x 2 = 3_2 structure. So we sum up the digits that have been painted over which is 1+ 0 = 1, not on the choice, or 6+0=6. But this does not match what is written on the choice. So if the first factor is 1, we should go through all the answers for the first digits, if the first digit is 2, then 2_ x 2, which does not fit, if the first number is 3, 3_x2, so we could also consider 13 * 2 = 26, so the sum of the digits painted is 1+6=7, not the choices.
If we think in the other direction, if the solution is 32, then 32/2 is 16. Therefore the digits covered are 1 and 0. And the sum is 1+0=1, but we do not have this choice.
In fact, let's consider that there's a typo in the multiplication operation. The result would need to be an even number. This is not the case. The question has a typo since there is not one correct answer. Let's look at the numbers.  The calculation must be in form of _3 x 2_ = _ 2 . This might suggest that it's a typo. Let's assume that it's 13x2 = 26, so that covered the digits 1 and 6. Then the sum is 7. It also cannot be 23x2 = 46. It also could be 3_ x 2= 32, so it must be 16. If it is 16*2=32, this is the result, then 1 is covered and 0 is covered from the result, but no answers match. So, let's examine the choices. Let's sum the digits in the equation. The missing digit is 1, and the last digits is 6. If it's 1+6=7, not answer. If 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 10.

The correct is: If it's 16*2 = 32, then 1+0=1, which is not in the choice. There might be a typo or the options given are not correct.  Since the given equation does not look like it is from a multiple of 2 digit, assume there are typos in the question.
