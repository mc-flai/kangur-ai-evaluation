Reasoning:
Let's analyze the problem. The passengers in a carriage have neighbors in their own carriage, and those in the adjacent carriages. If a passenger is in an end carriage, they have neighbors in the same carriage and one adjacent carriage, totaling 10 neighbors. If they have 5 neighbors, the situation is not possible, so the total number of passengers must be 15 (3 passengers per carriage)

If there are 3 passengers in each of the 5 carriages, there will be exactly 3 passengers in each of the carriages and each passenger in the middle carriages will have 10 neighbors, and each in the end carriages will have 5.
This is 15 in total.

Answer: B)
