Reasoning: Let's use variables to solve the problem. Let 'x' be the number of trees with 6 pears and 3 apples, and 'y' be the number of trees with 8 pears and 4 apples.  We have two equations based on the problem: 3x + 4y = 25 (total apples) and the question asks for the total number of pears. Solving the first equation in integers, we find x=3 and y=4.  So there are 3 trees with 6 pears and 4 trees with 8 pears. The total number of pears is (3 * 6) + (4 * 8) = 18 + 32 = 50.
