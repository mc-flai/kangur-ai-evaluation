Reasoning: We are looking for three-digit numbers ABC such that (A+B)^C is a three-digit power of two.
Three-digit powers of two are: 128 = 2^7
(A+B) can be at most 18 (9+9). C must be a whole number.
Let's examine the possibilities for (A+B)^C:
*   If (A+B)^C = 128, then C can only be 7 and A+B = 2. Possible values for A and B are (2,0), (1,1), (0,2) so A=1 or 2 and B is fixed.
*   If (A+B)^C = 256, then 256 = 4^4. A + B = 4 and C = 4. Then the possible values for A and B are (1,3) (2,2) (3,1) (4,0). A can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.
*   If (A+B)^C = 512, then 512 = 8^3 or 2^9.
    *   A+B = 8 and C = 3. There are 9 options (0,8), (1,7), ..., (8,0).
    *   A+B = 2 and C = 9. Not possible.
*   If (A+B)^C = 1024, not possible, not a 3 digit number.
Consider the cases:
1. (A+B)^C = 128
    A+B = 2, C = 7
    A can be 1,2.
    Thus AB can be 11, 20.
    Hence, possibilities are 117, 207.
2. (A+B)^C = 256
    A+B = 4, C = 4
    Then ABC could be 134, 224, 314, 404.
3. (A+B)^C = 512
    A+B=8, C=3
    AB can be 80, 71, 62, 53, 44, 35, 26, 17, 08. A can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 8 values.
    Thus ABC can be 803, 713, 623, 533, 443, 353, 263, 173, 83.
Total number of options = 2 + 4 + 9 = 15.
