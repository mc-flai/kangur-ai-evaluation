Reasoning:
The problem states that 4 apples + 1 pear = 3 pears. We can simplify this equation to see the relationship between apples and pears.
Subtracting 1 pear from both sides: 4 apples = 2 pears.
Dividing both sides by 2: 2 apples = 1 pear.

Therefore, the correct statement is "Two apples weigh as much as one pear."
