Reasoning:
The x-axis divides the plane into two regions.  The graph of f(x) = 2 - x^2 is a parabola opening downwards with a vertex at (0,2). It intersects the x-axis at x = sqrt(2) and x = -sqrt(2). It divides the plane into 3 regions.  The graph of g(x) = x^2 - 1 is a parabola opening upwards with a vertex at (0,-1). It intersects the x-axis at x = 1 and x = -1.   It divides the plane into 3 regions.  The parabolas intersect.  The two parabolas intersect when 2 - x^2 = x^2 - 1. Thus, 2x^2 = 3, so x^2 = 3/2 and x = +/- sqrt(3/2). The x axis divides the plane into 2 regions. The first parabola intersects the x-axis at two points, as does the second. Each parabola gives rise to 3 regions. The intersection points of the two parabolas gives rise to additional regions. Counting up the regions created, the answer is 9.
