Reasoning:  We want to find the number of integers between sqrt(N^2 + N + 1) and sqrt(9N^2 + N + 1).
Let's approximate the values of the square roots:
sqrt(N^2 + N + 1) is approximately sqrt(N^2) = N
sqrt(9N^2 + N + 1) is approximately sqrt(9N^2) = 3N.
The number of integers between N and 3N is approximately 3N - N - 1 = 2N - 1.

Alternatively, we could try with an example. If N=1, sqrt(3) and sqrt(11), which is between 1.732 and 3.31. Integers between them are 2,3. The number of integers is 2 = 2(1), is not 1+1, 2-1 = 1, 2*1=2, 2*1+1=3, 3*1=3
If N=2, sqrt(7) and sqrt(39). Between 2.645 and 6.24. Integers are 3, 4, 5, 6. The number of integers is 4 = 2(2), which matches the approximate result (2N-1)=3 or (2N)=4.
If N = 3, sqrt(13) and sqrt(82). Between 3.605 and 9.05. Integers are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Number of integers is 6 = 2(3).
The number of integers is the ceiling(sqrt(9N^2 + N + 1)) - floor(sqrt(N^2+N+1))-1.
Since sqrt(N^2 + N + 1) is always a bit greater than N, the number of integers is roughly 3N - N = 2N, so we might be looking for 2N or 2N-1.
Since the number of integers between a and b, where a and b are not included, is b-a-1.

sqrt(N^2 + N + 1) = N*sqrt(1 + 1/N + 1/N^2) approx N(1+1/(2N)) = N + 1/2.
sqrt(9N^2 + N + 1) = 3N*sqrt(1 + 1/(9N) + 1/(9N^2)) approx 3N(1+1/(18N)) = 3N + 1/6.
Then 3N + 1/6 - N - 1/2 - 1  approx 2N - 1/3, which corresponds to 2N - 1.

Answer: B)
