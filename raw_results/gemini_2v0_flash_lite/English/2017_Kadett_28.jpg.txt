Reasoning: Let the speeds of the first and second runners be $v_1$ and $v_2$ respectively, and the time for them to meet be $t$. The track length is 720 meters.
The first runner takes 4 minutes, or 240 seconds, to complete a lap, so $v_1 = 720/240 = 3$ m/s.
The second runner takes 5 minutes, or 300 seconds, to complete a lap, so $v_2 = 720/300 = 2.4$ m/s.
Since they run in opposite directions, the relative speed is $v_1 + v_2 = 3 + 2.4 = 5.4$ m/s.
The distance they cover when they meet is 720 meters. Thus, $t = 720 / (5.4) = 7200/54 = 400/3$ seconds.
In this time $t$, the distance the second runner covers is $v_2 * t = 2.4 * (400/3) = (24/10) * (400/3) = 8/10 * 400 = 320$ meters.
