Reasoning: Let's denote the number of balls in the smallest, middle, and biggest baskets as S, M, and B, respectively. We are given that S + M + B = 48. We are also given that S + B = 2M and S = M/2.
Substitute S = M/2 into the equation S + B = 2M:
M/2 + B = 2M, so B = 2M - M/2 = 3M/2.
Now substitute S = M/2 and B = 3M/2 into S + M + B = 48:
M/2 + M + 3M/2 = 48
(1/2 + 1 + 3/2)M = 48
(3)M = 48
M = 16
Now calculate S: S = M/2 = 16/2 = 8
Now calculate B: B = 3M/2 = 3(16)/2 = 48/2 = 24
So the biggest basket has 24 balls.
