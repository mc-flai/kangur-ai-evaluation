Reasoning:
The problem describes three semi-circles whose diameters form a right triangle.  The areas of the semi-circles are X, Y, and Z. The areas of the semi-circles correspond to the squares of the sides of the right triangle. Specifically, if the sides of the right triangle are a, b, and c, and the areas of the semi-circles with diameters a, b, and c are X, Y, and Z respectively, then X = (π/8)*a^2, Y = (π/8)*b^2, and Z = (π/8)*c^2. Based on the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), the areas should have the relationship (π/8)*a^2 + (π/8)*b^2 = (π/8)*c^2.  This simplifies to X + Y = Z.
