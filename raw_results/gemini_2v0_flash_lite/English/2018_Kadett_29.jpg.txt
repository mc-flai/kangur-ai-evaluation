Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given information about triangle ABC:
- ABC is an isosceles triangle with base AC, meaning AB = BC.
- Points K and L are on sides AB and BC, respectively.
- AK = KL = LB and KB = AC.
- We need to find the measure of angle ABC.

Let angle ABC be denoted as x. Since AB = BC, angles BAC and BCA are equal.  Let's call the angles BAC and BCA as y.
In triangle ABC, x + y + y = 180 degrees, or x + 2y = 180 degrees.
Since AK = KL, triangle AKL is an isosceles triangle, and angle KAL = angle KLA = y (angle BAK=y).  Also, let angle AKL be alpha. Then x+y=alpha.
Since KL=LB, triangle KBL is an isosceles triangle.  Angle BKL = 180 - alpha.
Therefore, angle KBL = angle BKL = angle AKL - 180 - alpha = alpha.
Since triangle KBL is an isosceles triangle and KL=LB then angle BKL= angle LBK. Since, angle LBK = x, then alpha = x.  So x=BKL and alpha = x which is an absurd.
In triangle KBL, KL = LB and KB = AC.
Then angle BKL = angle LBK = angle ABC = x.
angle KBL = angle LBK= x.
Also,  Since AK = KL, then triangle AKL is an isosceles triangle.
Angle KAL = angle KLA.
Also, AK = KL = LB and KB = AC.
Let's assume angle BAC = angle BCA = z.
So x + 2z = 180.
In the isosceles triangle AKL, we have AK = KL.
Therefore, angle KAL = angle ALK.
Let angle AKL = a. Then angle KAL = angle ALK = (180 - a) / 2.
angle ALK = angle BKL.
Now BKL = angle ABC = x.
Consider triangle KBL.
KL = LB, so, angle BKL = angle ABC.
So angle BKL = angle ABC.
Angle KBL = angle ABC=x.
Also AK=KL=LB and KB=AC.
Then, angle BKL= x, means Angle BKL = angle LBK = x.
Therefore, angle BKL = angle KLB = x
The sum of interior angles in triangle KBL is 180, so x + angle BKL + angle LBK.
So we have x + x + x=180. Therefore, x + x+ x= 180.
Also, we know ABC=x.
But x+2z = 180.
Angle AKL = 180 - angle BKL. Since BKL is angle x, so AKL = x.
If Angle BKL = angle LBK then in triangle KBL, angle BKL = angle BLK = x, and x+x+x=180.
So 3x=180, or x=60.

However KB = AC, and KB = BC, so KB=BC.
So x + 2y = 180, and ABC=x, so in triangle BKL, BL = x, so in triangle ABC the sides are AB=BC.
Then, in the triangle KBL angle K = angle B = 180/3 = 60.

Given KB=AC, LB=KL, and let AB=BC then, AB = BC.
Also AK = KL = LB, so AK + KB = AB.
So, we have AK = KL, LB = KL.
In triangle AKL, AK=KL. So, KAL = ALK. Let the angle BAK be y, and then Angle KAL and KLA=y.
Angle AKL is 180-2y.
Given AK=KL=LB. Angle AKL+BKL=180
Then, since BKL=x and Angle K = ABC=60 we should get angle ABC.
So x + x+ x=180. 
Consider, ABC=x and BAC= BCA.

So then we have BKL= angle x. BKL=x. Since ABC=60 degrees.
Then in the isosceles triangle KBL, if KL=LB so BKL = KBL.
The angle KBL= Angle ABC=x.
In this configuration, since x=60 and x+2y=180, implies 60+2y = 180, and 2y=120, or y=60.
If x=36, then 2y = 180-36. So, y=72.

If we draw the image, it looks like x=36 degrees. Therefore, considering the relationships between the sides and angles, the most plausible result is x=36Â°.
