Reasoning: The sum of all the numbers is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255. Let Eva's sum be E and Ali's sum be A. We know that E = A + 31, and E + A = 255. Substituting the first equation into the second gives (A + 31) + A = 255, which simplifies to 2A + 31 = 255. Subtracting 31 from both sides gives 2A = 224, and dividing by 2 gives A = 112.  Then E = A + 31 = 112 + 31 = 143. We need to find a combination of the numbers that sum to 143. Notice that 128 + 16 - 1 = 143, which can be adjusted to 128 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 143. This means Eva selected 128, 16 is not an option. Another combination would be 128 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 143. The number of envelopes is 5.
