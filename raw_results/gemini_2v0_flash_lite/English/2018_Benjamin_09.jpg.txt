Reasoning: The problem presents a subtraction problem with some digits obscured. We can fill in the missing digit in the first number.  Since the second number is 3, and when we subtract 2 we end up with 2, this means that after subtracting we need to end up with 2 in the tens place, meaning we are subtracting 30-2=28, meaning the missing numbers are 30 and the answer is 3 and 8 and if we add 3 and 8 we get 11 and we have to add the missing digit to the answer.

Answer: D)
