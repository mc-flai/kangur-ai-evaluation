Reasoning: The problem describes an ant crawling along a closed line on a cube. We need to identify which net of a cube corresponds to the ant's path. By visually examining the nets, we can imagine folding them into cubes and tracing the path of the lines. We are looking for a path that is continuous across the cube faces.

(A) the path here does not seem consistent
(B) the path here is also inconsistent
(C) The path here is inconsistent as well.
(D) This path connects continuously from one face to the other.
(E) The path seems inconsistent here

Answer: D)
