Reasoning: The question describes a rotating block. The sequence of the first three rotations is shown. We can visualize each rotation and the position of the building block. The pattern of the block rotates at a constant rate, and the question asks for the final position after 10 rotations. The pattern repeats after 3 rotations, so we need to consider 10 mod 3, which is 1. Therefore, we can look at the first position to determine the last position of the building block after 10 turns.

Answer: A)
