Reasoning: The question describes three vases with different amounts of water (4 liters, 3 liters, and 4 liters respectively) but appearing the same size from the side. The images provided represent what the vases would look like when viewed from above. We need to match the water levels represented in the options based on the amounts of water.
Vase I has 4 liters, Vase II has 3 liters, and Vase III has 4 liters.
Looking at the options:
- A) I and III appear to have the same volume, and II has less than both.
- B) I and III appear to have the same volume, and II has less than both.
- C) I and III appear to have the same volume, and II has less than both.
- D) I and III appear to have the same volume, and II has less than both.
- E) I and III appear to have the same volume, and II has less than both.

We can discard any options where the volumes in I and III are unequal.
The height of I and III should be equal as they contain the same amount of water, and the height of II should be lower. All the above images fulfil this condition.

Answer: A)
