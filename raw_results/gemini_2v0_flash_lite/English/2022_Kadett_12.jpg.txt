Reasoning: We need to plant a tree so that each path has an equal number of trees on either side. Let's analyze the map:
*   Path 1: Separates A, D and B, C, E. Currently, there are 2 trees on the A, D side (2), and 3 on the B, C, E side.
*   Path 2: Separates A, B, D, C, and E. Currently, there are 3 trees on the A, B, D, side and 2 on the C, E side.
*   Path 3: Separates A, B, C, E and D. Currently, there are 4 trees on A, B, C, E and 1 on D side.

The ideal arrangement is with 3 trees on each side of the 3 paths.

If we add a tree in section D, the configuration becomes:
*   Path 1: 3 trees (A, D) and 3 trees (B, C, E).
*   Path 2: 3 trees (A, B, D), 2 trees (C, E).
*   Path 3: 4 trees (A, B, C, E), 2 trees (D).

Therefore, adding the tree in section D will not lead to an equal distribution of trees.
If we add a tree in section A, the configuration becomes:
*   Path 1: 3 trees (A, D), 3 trees (B, C, E).
*   Path 2: 4 trees (A, B, D), 2 trees (C, E).
*   Path 3: 4 trees (A, B, C, E), 2 trees (D).

Therefore, adding the tree in section A will not lead to an equal distribution of trees.

If we add the tree in section E, the configuration becomes:
*   Path 1: 2 trees (A, D), 4 trees (B, C, E).
*   Path 2: 3 trees (A, B, D), 3 trees (C, E).
*   Path 3: 4 trees (A, B, C, E), 2 trees (D).

If we plant a tree in section B, the configuration becomes:
*   Path 1: 2 trees (A, D), 4 trees (B, C, E).
*   Path 2: 4 trees (A, B, D), 2 trees (C, E).
*   Path 3: 4 trees (A, B, C, E), 2 trees (D).

If we plant a tree in section C, the configuration becomes:
*   Path 1: 2 trees (A, D), 4 trees (B, C, E).
*   Path 2: 3 trees (A, B, D), 3 trees (C, E).
*   Path 3: 4 trees (A, B, C, E), 2 trees (D).

If we plant a tree in E:
*   Path 1: 2 trees (A, D) and 4 trees (B, C, E)
*   Path 2: 3 trees (A, B, D) and 3 trees (C, E)
*   Path 3: 4 trees (A, B, C, E) and 2 trees (D)

If we plant a tree in B:
*   Path 1: 2 trees (A, D) and 4 trees (B, C, E)
*   Path 2: 4 trees (A, B, D) and 2 trees (C, E)
*   Path 3: 4 trees (A, B, C, E) and 2 trees (D)

If we plant in E, and then in C:
* Path 1: 2 trees (A, D), and 4 trees (B,C,E)
* Path 2: 3 trees (A,B,D), and 3 trees (C,E)
* Path 3: 4 trees (A,B,C,E), 2 trees (D)
The only possible answer will be planting a new tree in Section B.

Answer: B)
