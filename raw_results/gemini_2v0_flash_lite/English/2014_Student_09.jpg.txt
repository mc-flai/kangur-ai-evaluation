Reasoning: The question describes cutting two identical cylinders and combining them into one big cylinder. The volume of the cylinder is proportional to its radius squared multiplied by its height. The new cylinder is made by 'unwrapping' and combining two small cylinders. Hence, the resulting cylinder would have the same radius and the height will be 2 times of each small cylinder. Because the radius of each cylinder is the same and the height of the new one is twice the size, the volume will double.

Answer: A)
