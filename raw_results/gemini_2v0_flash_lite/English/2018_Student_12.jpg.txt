Reasoning:
The graph shows that the height of the water increases rapidly at first and then slows down as time increases. This suggests that the cross-sectional area of the vase is decreasing as the height increases.

*   **(A)** A cylinder has a constant cross-sectional area, so the water level would rise at a constant rate, resulting in a linear graph.
*   **(B)** This vase initially has a wide bottom, so the water level would rise slowly at first, then increase more rapidly as the width decreases in the middle, and then slow down again as the width increases towards the top, which does not match the provided graph.
*   **(C)** The cross-sectional area of the vase is decreasing as the height increases which does not match the provided graph.
*   **(D)** A cone has a decreasing cross-sectional area as the height increases. This would result in a graph that starts steeply and levels off, similar to the graph in the problem.
*   **(E)** The vase initially has a small bottom section which would make the height rise rapidly at first, which does not match the graph.

Answer: D)
