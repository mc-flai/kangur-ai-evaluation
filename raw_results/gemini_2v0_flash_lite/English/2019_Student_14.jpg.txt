Reasoning: Let's analyze the given operation and the equation. The operation is defined as x ◊ y = y - x. Now, substitute this definition into the main equation:
(a ◊ b) ◊ c = a ◊ (b ◊ c)
First evaluate the left side:
(a ◊ b) = b - a
(b - a) ◊ c = c - (b - a) = c - b + a
Next evaluate the right side:
(b ◊ c) = c - b
a ◊ (c - b) = (c - b) - a = c - b - a
Now equate the left and right sides:
c - b + a = c - b - a
Simplify the equation:
a = -a
2a = 0
a = 0

Now we'll analyze each of the options:
A) a = b, is not necessarily true.
B) b = c, is not necessarily true.
C) a = c, is not necessarily true.
D) a = 0, is necessarily true.
E) c = 0, is not necessarily true.

Answer: D)
