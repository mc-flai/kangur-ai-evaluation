Reasoning: We need to form two-digit numbers greater than 10 and less than 25 using the digits 0, 1, 2, and 8, with no repeating digits.

*   **Tens digit 1:** The possible numbers are 10, 12, and 18. However, we need to create numbers bigger than 10.
*   So, from the ten's place digit of 1, we can create 12, 18.

*   **Tens digit 2:** The possible numbers are 20, 21, and 28. Because all of these numbers are below 25, they are all valid.

So the possible numbers are: 12, 18, 20, 21, and 28. These are all the numbers we can form that meet the conditions. There are 5 such numbers.
