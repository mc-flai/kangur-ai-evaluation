Reasoning:
Let x be the number of tables with 3 chairs, y be the number of tables with 4 chairs, and z be the number of tables with 6 chairs.
We know:
1) x + y + z = 16 (total tables)
2) 3x + 4y = 36 (guests at tables with 3 or 4 chairs)
3) 3x + 4y + 6z = 72 (total guests)
From equation (2), we can express y as:
y = (36 - 3x) / 4 = 9 - (3/4)x
Since x and y must be integers, x must be a multiple of 4. Thus, possible values for x are 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.
From equation (1) and (3),
x + y + z = 16
3x + 4y + 6z = 72
Multiply the first equation by 6: 6x + 6y + 6z = 96
Subtract equation (3) from this result: 3x + 2y = 24
y = (24 - 3x) / 2 = 12 - (3/2)x
Since x and y must be integers, x must be an even number.
Possible values for x are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
Also, the values for x must be the same.
From (2) we have y = (36 - 3x)/4.
Then from the first equation: z = 16 - x - y = 16 - x - (36-3x)/4
From equation (3), the total number of guests, 3x + 4y + 6z = 72.
If x = 4, y = (36 - 12)/4 = 6. z = 16 - 4 - 6 = 6. Check equation 3.
3*4 + 4*6 + 6*6 = 12 + 24 + 36 = 72. Correct.
Thus x=4 tables with 3 chairs.
