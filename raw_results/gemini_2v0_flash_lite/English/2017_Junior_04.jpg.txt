Reasoning:
1. Calculate the total amount of money: Maria has 24 Euros, and her 3 sisters have 12 Euros each, making a total of 24 + 3*12 = 24 + 36 = 60 Euros.
2. Calculate the amount each person should have to make the amounts equal: 60 Euros / 4 people = 15 Euros per person.
3. Determine how much Maria needs to give to each sister: Maria needs to give up some Euros to get each sister to 15. Currently each sister has 12, so Maria needs to give each sister 15-12 = 3 Euros.
4. Determine the total amount of money to give: 3 Euros to each sister.
