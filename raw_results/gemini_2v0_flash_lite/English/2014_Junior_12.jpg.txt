Reasoning: The height of the picture is related to how close the bottom edge of the picture is to the floor. A larger height will bring the bottom edge closer to the floor. The nail is placed at the top and a 2m string is used. The height of nail placement is 2.5m (which is 250cm).
The picture size is given by width x height. We are looking for which picture size (height) is smallest compared to the 2m string tied from nail to the corners of the top edge, and the height of the picture, therefore the bigger the height, the closer the bottom edge will be to the floor.
Comparing the height of the pictures :
A) 40cm
B) 50cm
C) 90cm
D) 60cm
E) 100cm
From this we see that the height of the picture will bring the bottom edge closest to the floor is 100 cm.

Answer: E)
