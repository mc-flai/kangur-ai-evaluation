Reasoning: The numbers in the white boxes represent the number of smileys in neighboring gray boxes. We can deduce the placement of smileys in the gray boxes to match these numbers. The top left 3 requires 3 smileys around it. The top right 3 requires 3 smileys around it. The 2 at the top left implies 2 smiley faces. The 2 in the middle requires 2 smileys. The 1 in the bottom requires 1 smiley. Counting the necessary smileys, the total number of smileys hidden is 3+3+2+2+1 = 11 smileys.
