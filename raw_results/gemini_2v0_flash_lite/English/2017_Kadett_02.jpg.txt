Reasoning: The question asks for the time 17 hours after 17:00 (5 PM).  Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can subtract 24 hours from the initial time 17:00, which gives us the same time as 17:00. To find the time after 17 hours, we can do the following calculation: 17 + 17 = 34. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can subtract 24 hours to find the time in the next day: 34 - 24 = 10. Therefore, it will be 10:00.
