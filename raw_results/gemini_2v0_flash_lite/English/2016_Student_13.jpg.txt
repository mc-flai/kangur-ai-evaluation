Reasoning:
We are given x₁ = 2 and xₙ₊₁ = xₙˣₙ. We need to find x₄. Let's calculate the first few terms:
x₁ = 2
x₂ = x₁ˣ¹ = 2² = 4
x₃ = x₂ˣ² = 4⁴ = (2²)⁴ = 2⁸
x₄ = x₃ˣ³ = (2⁸)⁸ = 2⁶⁴
None of the options directly matches the calculated answer but they are all of the format 2 to the power of something, let's calculate the value of the powers in the options to check.
Option (A) = 2⁸ = 2^(2³) = 256
Option (B) = 2¹⁶ = 2^(2⁴) = 65536
Option (C) = 2²⁰⁴⁸ = 2^(2¹¹)
Option (D) = 2⁶⁵⁵³⁶ = 2^(2¹⁶)
Option (E) = 2^(2^768)
Since x₃ = 2⁸, and x₄ = (x₃)ˣ³ = (2⁸)⁸ = 2⁶⁴.
Let's calculate the exponent of x₄:
x₁ = 2
x₂ = 2² = 4
x₃ = 4⁴ = 2⁸
x₄ = (2⁸)⁸ = 2⁶⁴.
However, comparing the given options.
Since x₂ = 2² = 2^(2¹), the exponent is calculated from the previous term:
x₃ = (x₂)ˣ² = (2²)⁽²²⁾= 2^(2^(2*1)), x₃ = 2^(2*2*2) = 2⁸
x₄ = (x₃)ˣ³ = (2⁸)⁸ = 2^(8*8) = 2^(2³ * 2³) = 2^(64)
x₄ = 2^(2⁶)
Let's look at the pattern with power:
x₁ = 2,
x₂ = x₁^x₁ = 2^2 = 4,
x₃ = x₂^x₂ = 4^4 = (2^2)^4 = 2^8,
x₄ = x₃^x₃ = (2^8)^2^8 = 2^(8 * 2^8) = 2^(2³*2^8) = 2^(2^3*2^3)=2^64 = 2^(2⁶).
Consider xₙ₊₁ = xₙˣₙ.
x₁ = 2.
x₂ = x₁ˣ¹ = 2² = 2^(2¹).
x₃ = x₂ˣ² = (2²)²² = 2^(2*2²) = 2^(2*4) = 2⁸.
x₄ = x₃ˣ³ = (2⁸)⁸ = 2^(8*8) = 2^(64) = 2^(2⁶).

None of the options look quite correct but let's test the following:
x₁ = 2
x₂ = x₁ˣ¹= 2² = 4
x₃ = x₂ˣ² = 4⁴ = (2²)⁴ = 2⁸
x₄ = x₃ˣ³ = (2⁸)⁸ = 2⁶⁴.
This would imply that x₄ = 2⁶⁴.
The correct answer would be the one closest. However, the answer should be formatted as 2^(something). Let us analyze this from the ground up
x₁ = 2
x₂ = x₁ˣ¹ = 2² = 4
x₃ = x₂ˣ² = 4⁴ = (2²)⁴ = 2⁸
x₄ = x₃ˣ³ = (2⁸)⁸ = 2⁶⁴ = 2^(2⁶)
x₄ = 2^(64). The closest among the provided options is D. However, it should have 64 in the exponent as shown, but among the options available the exponent of the solution will be x₃*x₃, x₃ = 2⁸ and x₃ˣ³ then will become 2^(8*8).
The exponent is x₃ˣ³ = 8⁸. Then x₃ = 2⁸. Thus (2⁸)⁸ = 2^(8*8) = 2^(2³ * 2³) = 2⁶⁴. It can be written as 2^(2⁶).

Answer: D)
