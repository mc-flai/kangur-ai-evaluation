Reasoning: The numbers must be greater than 10 and less than 32, only containing the digits 1, 2, and 3.
*   Numbers starting with 1: 11, 12, 13.
*   Numbers starting with 2: 21, 22, 23.
*   The numbers are all two-digit numbers since they are larger than 10. The largest possible number is 31.
*   31 is not allowed since it's above 32. The numbers starting with 3 are only 31.
*   Therefore, there are 6 numbers.
