Reasoning: Let the middle cell contain the number x. The other cells can then be expressed in terms of x. The sum of the 9 cells will be 500. Considering the differences of 1 between adjacent cells and the symmetry of a 3x3 grid, the numbers will be centered around the middle cell. Since the total sum is 500, it's likely the middle cell is roughly 500/9 â‰ˆ 55. The sum of the 9 cells is therefore: (x-2)+(x-1)+x+(x+1)+(x+2)+(x-1)+x+(x+1)+(x-2) = 9x = 500. In addition, if x is the middle value, the sum of the numbers in the table will be 9x = 500. However, since the numbers have to be whole numbers, the average of those number, and therefore, the value in the center must be the one closest to the result of the division.
So the values must sum to 500, The values have to be whole numbers.
The values in the middle cell should be close to the average which is 500/9 = 55.5
The number in the middle cell should be (56),
