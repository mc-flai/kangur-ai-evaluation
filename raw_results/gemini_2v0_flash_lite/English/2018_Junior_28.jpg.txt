Reasoning:
1.  The numbers 1 to 6 must be placed in a 2x3 table such that all row and column sums are divisible by 3.
2.  The sum of the numbers 1 to 6 is 21, which is divisible by 3.
3.  Each row sum and each column sum must be divisible by 3. This means that we need to divide the set of numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} into two groups (rows) and three groups (columns) such that sums in these groups are divisible by 3.
4.  Let's consider possible row sums: the only options are 9 and 12 in some order. Possible column sums are 6, 9 and 6 in some order.
5.  Consider the arrangement of the numbers into two rows. The number of ways we could partition the numbers is based on the number of ways to choose three from the six numbers to be one row and the other three numbers to be the other row. So, we need to form two rows each summing to some multiple of 3.
6.  Let's see how many combinations can give a total sum as divisible by 3: Row 1 could have a sum of 9. Row 2 then has a sum of 12 (21-9).
    *   The ways to make sums equal 9: 1+2+6, 1+3+5, 2+3+4. There are 3 combinations for row 1.
    *   So there are three possible sets for the rows. Now each of the six numbers needs to fit into the columns.
    *   Column 1: 1+5 or 2+4 or 3+3. The sum will be divisible by 3.
    *   Column 2: 2+4 or 1+5 or 3+3. The sum will be divisible by 3.
    *   Column 3: 6+x.
7.  However, we can look at column sums being divisible by 3. Possible sums are 6, 9, 6.
8.  First put the number 1 into a cell.
9.  The column of 1 can contain either 2, 3, 4, or 5. We will have two rows of 3 numbers and three columns of two numbers. So we can have 3 columns adding up to 6+x, 9+y, 6+z.
10. If we consider putting the number 6 with 3 in the first row, so we have (6, 3). then (1, 2) should go to another row. so it will be like (6, 3, x), (1, 2, y).
11. Then consider combinations: (1,2,6) and (3,4,5) - with these columns summing up to 6, 9, and 6 in the given order (column1, column2, column3). There are 3! * 2! = 6*2 = 12 ways to arrange the numbers for row 1. And then 2!*3! = 12 ways for arrangement of the numbers for row 2. We have 3! ways to arrange 3 columns. so there are 3! * 2 * 2 * 3! = 36 combinations.
12. Let us consider the other possible combinations: (1,3,5), (2,4,6) - column sums: 6,9,6.
13. If we have (1,3,5), (2,4,6), then we have 3! arrangements each = 36 ways. Each row has 3 cells, each column has 2 cells. So we have 2 rows and 3 columns. Thus, we need to ensure each sum is divisible by 3.
