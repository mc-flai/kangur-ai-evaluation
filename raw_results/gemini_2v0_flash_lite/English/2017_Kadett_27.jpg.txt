Reasoning: The big cube has tunnels going through it, which implies that the overall cube is 5x5x5. Each tunnel removes a row/column/layer of cubes. The tunnels are of the form: 3 tunnels in each direction. Therefore, from each direction, there are 3 tunnels, each tunnel will take away 5 cubes, so there are 3 x 5 = 15 cubes not used on each side. However, each tunnel takes away some of the same cubes as other tunnels. There are 3 tunnels on each direction. Thus we can remove the tunnels on each of the directions, and we will remove 3 x 5 = 15 cubes. The remaining cubes are 125 - 15 = 110. But then we need to consider where these tunnels intersect, which forms a cross shape in the middle. In each corner, there are 3 intersecting tunnels, which is where we intersect cubes in the tunnels that are counted. The tunnels have 3x3x3 cubes removed. Thus, there are 27 cubes that are used. There are 9 tunnels, so we have to make sure not to double count. There are 3 tunnels coming from each direction, for example, from front side, so we have to use 3 x 5 cubes. The cube is 5x5x5, and we need to figure out the number of cubes not used. There are 3 tunnels in each direction. So, 3 tunnels are not being used, so this is 3 x 5 = 15. But there is overlap.  The cube is 5x5x5=125.  The core of the cube does not have the tunnels, it's 3x3x3 = 27.  Then subtract these numbers: 125-27 = 98.  But from the diagram, there are actually 9 tunnels, so we need to find out how many cubes were not used. If we make 9 tunnels, then there are three tunnels that are going through the cube. Each of these tunnels would remove the inner 3x3x3 volume and make the edges as tunnels. The 125 cubes make a 5x5x5 cube. The total number of cubes used is then 125-27 = 98, and those used are 125 - 3x3 = 9x5 = 45. 125-45 = 80, 125-39=86. The tunnels are 3x3x3 and a core of 3x3x3, a corner of 1x1x1. Tunnels go through the whole cube. So, the 5x5x5 cube. So 3 tunnels each way. 5x5x5 -> 125 small cubes.  Then there is a 3x3x3 core. 5x5x5 (125). The unused cubes in each tunnel is 5x3 = 15. The 3 tunnels will intersect. 3x3x3. We need to calculate the number of cubes NOT used, so there is a 3x3x3 in the center. The number of cubes remaining is 125 - 3x3 = 45. 125-80= 45. The question asks for how many cubes are not being used. Thus, there are 3 tunnels on each direction. The center is unused. Thus there are 125 - (9 tunnels, each 5 cubes) = 125- 45 = 45.
