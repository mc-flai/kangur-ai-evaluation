Reasoning:
We need to find the value that makes the equation true.
First, calculate the left side: 2 * 18 * 14 = 504
Now, look at the right side: 6 * _ * 7
Let's call the missing number 'x'. So we have: 6 * x * 7 = 504
Simplify the right side: 42 * x = 504
Divide both sides by 42: x = 504 / 42
x = 12
