Reasoning: To guarantee that at least three buttons have the same color, consider the worst-case scenario. The students could first pick one button of each color (1 red, 1 white, and 1 blue). Then, they could pick one more of each color (another red, another white, and another blue). At this point, the students have two buttons of each color, using 6 students. The very next button picked, by the 7th student, *must* be either red, white, or blue and thus it will give at least 3 buttons of the same color.

Answer: (C)
