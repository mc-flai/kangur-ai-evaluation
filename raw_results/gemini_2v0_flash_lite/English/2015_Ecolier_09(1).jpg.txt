Reasoning:
1.  Luis starts with 7 apples and 2 bananas.
2.  He gives away 2 apples, so he has 7 - 2 = 5 apples left.
3.  After the exchange, Luis has the same number of apples as bananas, so he needs 5 bananas.
4.  He originally had 2 bananas, so he must have received 5 - 2 = 3 bananas from Jacob.

Answer: B)
