Reasoning:
Let's calculate how many games Beth has won. Since she has played 200 games and her winning rate is 49%, she has won 200 * 0.49 = 98 games.
Let x be the number of additional games she plays and wins. Then the total number of games played will be 200 + x, and the total number of games won will be 98 + x. We want to find the smallest integer x such that the winning rate is 50%. This can be expressed as (98 + x) / (200 + x) = 0.5.
Multiply both sides by (200 + x):
98 + x = 0.5 * (200 + x)
98 + x = 100 + 0.5x
0.5x = 2
x = 4
Thus, if she plays and wins 4 more games, her winning percentage will be (98+4) / (200+4) = 102/204 = 0.5, or 50%.
