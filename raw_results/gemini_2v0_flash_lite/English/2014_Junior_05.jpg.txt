Reasoning:
The question describes the year 2014 as a year where the last digit (4) is bigger than the sum of the other digits (2 + 0 + 1 = 3). We need to find the previous year that follows this rule.
Let's start from 2014 and go backward:
- 2014: 4 > (2+0+1 = 3) - True
- 2013: 3 > (2+0+1 = 3) - False
- 2012: 2 > (2+0+1 = 3) - False
- 2011: 1 > (2+0+1 = 3) - False
- 2010: 0 > (2+0+1 = 3) - False
- 2009: 9 > (2+0+0 = 2) - True. Hence, this is the last time it happened.
Years ago = 2014 - 2009 = 5
