Reasoning: The equation is a linear function f(x) = -3.5x + 7.  This is a line with a negative slope (-3.5) and a y-intercept of 7.  A negative slope means the line slopes downwards from left to right. A y-intercept of 7 means the line crosses the y-axis at (0, 7). Since the y-intercept is positive and the slope is negative, the line must pass through quadrants I, II, and IV. It will not pass through quadrant III.
