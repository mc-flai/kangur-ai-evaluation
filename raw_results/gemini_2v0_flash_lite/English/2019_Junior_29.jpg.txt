Reasoning:
1.  **Conditions on a, b, and c:** The problem states that a, b, and c are three-digit numbers, and the first digit of each number is equal to the last digit. This means that each number is of the form XYX, where X and Y are digits. Also, b = 2a + 1 and c = 2b + 1.
2.  **Expressing c in terms of a:** Since b = 2a + 1 and c = 2b + 1, we can substitute for b: c = 2(2a + 1) + 1 = 4a + 2 + 1 = 4a + 3.
3.  **Finding bounds for a:** Since a, b, and c are three-digit numbers, they must be greater than or equal to 101 (the smallest three-digit number of the form XYX) and less than or equal to 999 (the largest three-digit number of the form XYX).
    *   a = XYX, with X being 1-9 and Y being 0-9. The smallest possible value for 'a' is 101, the largest possible value is 9XY9.
    *   b = 2a + 1.  If a = 101, b = 203. If a = 494, b = 989.
    *   c = 2b + 1 = 4a + 3. If a = 101, c = 407. If a = 249, c=999.
4.  **Analyzing the equation c = 4a + 3 and number properties:**
    Since `c` is of form XYX, we can say that it is of the form 101 to 999.
    So, `101 <= c <= 999` and we also know that `c = 4a + 3`.
    Therefore, `101 <= 4a + 3 <= 999`. Subtracting 3 from all sides, we get:
    `98 <= 4a <= 996`. Dividing all sides by 4, we get:
    `24.5 <= a <= 249`.
    Since the first and last digits of `a` are equal, `a` must be of form XYX. Therefore, X has to be between 1 and 9. This further means that X, the first digit of a, can be 1, 2.
    *   If the first digit of a is 1, then `a` can be 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, or 191. Then `b` could be 203, 223, 243, 263, 283, 303, 323, 343, 363, or 383, and `c` could be 407, 447, 487, 527, 567, 607, 647, 687, 727, or 767.
    *   If the first digit of a is 2, then a can be 202, 212, 222, 232, 242, 252, 262, 272, 282, or 292.
    *   If we put these conditions in consideration, a, b and c have to be of the form XYX
    *   For a to be of form XYX, and 24.5 <= a <= 249, a can be 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, 212, 222, 232, 242.
    *   If a = 202, then b = 2(202)+1 = 405 which is not of form XYX, so 202 is rejected.
    *   If a = 212, then b = 2(212)+1 = 425 which is not of form XYX, so 212 is rejected.
    *   If a = 222, then b = 2(222)+1 = 445 which is not of form XYX, so 222 is rejected.
    *   If a = 232, then b = 2(232)+1 = 465 which is not of form XYX, so 232 is rejected.
    *   If a = 242, then b = 2(242)+1 = 485 which is not of form XYX, so 242 is rejected.
    *   If a = 101, then b = 2(101) + 1 = 203 which is not in the XYX format, so 101 is rejected.
    *   If a = 111, then b = 2(111) + 1 = 223 which is not in the XYX format, so 111 is rejected.
    *   If a = 121, then b = 2(121) + 1 = 243 which is not in the XYX format, so 121 is rejected.
    *   If a = 131, then b = 2(131) + 1 = 263 which is not in the XYX format, so 131 is rejected.
    *   If a = 141, then b = 2(141) + 1 = 283 which is not in the XYX format, so 141 is rejected.
    *   If a = 151, then b = 2(151) + 1 = 303 which is in the XYX format, so 151 is not rejected. Further c = 2(303) + 1 = 607.
    *   If a = 161, then b = 2(161) + 1 = 323 which is in the XYX format, so 161 is not rejected. Further c = 2(323) + 1 = 647 which is not in the XYX format, so 161 is rejected.
    *   So far, for a = 151, we have b = 303, c = 607. So there is one valid value for a, b, c.
    *   If a = 171, then b = 2(171) + 1 = 343 which is in the XYX format, so 171 is not rejected. Further c = 2(343) + 1 = 687 which is not in the XYX format, so 171 is rejected.
    *   If a = 181, then b = 2(181) + 1 = 363 which is in the XYX format, so 181 is not rejected. Further c = 2(363) + 1 = 727 which is in the XYX format, so 181 can also be valid.
    *   If a = 191, then b = 2(191) + 1 = 383 which is in the XYX format, so 191 is not rejected. Further c = 2(383) + 1 = 767 which is in the XYX format, so 191 can also be valid.
    *   Therefore we have 3 valid values 151, 181, 191.

5.  **Conclusion:** We found that there are more than 3 possible values for 'a' (in fact, there are 3 such values 151, 181, 191) that meet the criteria.
