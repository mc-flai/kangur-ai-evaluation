Reasoning:
The smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999. We need to find the number of multiples of 13 in this range.
The smallest three-digit number divisible by 13 is 104 (13 * 8).
The largest three-digit number divisible by 13 is 988 (13 * 76).
To find the total number of such numbers, we can count the integers from 8 to 76, inclusive.
Number of multiples = 76 - 8 + 1 = 69

Answer: B)
