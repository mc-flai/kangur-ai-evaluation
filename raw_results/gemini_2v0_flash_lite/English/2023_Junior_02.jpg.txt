Reasoning:
The problem states Maria first ran to the underground (high speed), then exited after two stops (brief periods of zero speed), and finally walked (medium speed) to school.

*   **A:** Shows a high speed, some lower speeds, but no zero speeds that represents the stops, so that doesn't match the problem description.
*   **B:** The diagram has a high speed (running), two brief drops to zero speed (stops), and then a medium speed (walking). This matches the problem description.
*   **C:** The diagram starts with high speed, followed by a drop to zero, and then medium speed, without two stops, but only one.
*   **D:** The diagram does not match the problem description.
*   **E:** This doesn't represent a walk since her final speed is also high, not medium.

Answer: B)
