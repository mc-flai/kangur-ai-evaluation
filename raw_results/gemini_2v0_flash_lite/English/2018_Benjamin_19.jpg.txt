Reasoning: We need to trace the movements of the ladybirds across each whistle. The key constraints are: one ladybird remains stationary, and the others move to an adjacent, empty cell, without returning to a cell they just vacated. Analyzing the movements from the "After the third whistle" state helps us determine a possible configuration after the fourth whistle. We can eliminate options based on the valid moves. From the third whistle position, the ladybirds in the top row are forced to move to the empty cell. the ladybird at the bottom must also move. Inspecting the given options, option (E) matches this movement.

Answer: E)
