Reasoning:
Let the right triangle be ABC, with the right angle at B. Let the angle bisector of angle A intersect BC at D. Let AB = x, AC = a, and BD = 1, CD = 2. The Angle Bisector Theorem states that AD is the angle bisector, then AB/BD = AC/CD, so we have x/1 = a/2, or a = 2x. Let AD = y, by the Length of the Angle Bisector formula is : y^2 = AB*AC - BD*CD  y^2 = ax - 1*2 = 2x^2 - 2. Also from Pythagorean theorem: x^2 + 3^2 = a^2, or x^2 + 9 = 4x^2. Thus, 3x^2 = 9, and x^2 = 3.
We can calculate the length of the angle bisector AD = y.  y^2 = 2x^2 - 2. Substitute x^2 = 3  y^2 = 2(3) - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4
y = sqrt(4) = 2
Then the length of angle bisector is sqrt(4)
