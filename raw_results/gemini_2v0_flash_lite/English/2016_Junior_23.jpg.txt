Reasoning: The chessboard pattern has 13 squares of one color. Because each move changes the color of two adjacent squares, to achieve the pattern, we need to switch the color of 13 squares at the minimum. Since each move affects two squares. If there were an even number of colored squares, it's impossible to obtain the pattern, therefore the total number of moves should be at least 13 moves, where each move changes the color of two fields. Therefore, we will get to the closest integer to obtain the pattern.
