Reasoning:
The problem describes a rectangular sheet folded along its diagonal. One side of the rectangle is 12 cm, and the diagonal is 20 cm. The folded area forms a triangle. The question asks for the overlapping area. However, the 12cm given is not the base of the triangle. We must find the missing side using Pythagorean theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, so b = sqrt(20^2 - 12^2) = sqrt(400 - 144) = sqrt(256) = 16 cm. The original rectangle has an area of 12 cm * 16 cm = 192 cm^2.  The folded area is a triangle with base 12 cm and height 16 cm. The area of the entire triangle is 0.5 * 12 cm * 16 cm = 96 cm^2. The overlapping area is half of the area of this triangle.  The diagram illustrates that the overlapping area is the area of a smaller triangle within the larger triangle formed by the fold.  This smaller triangle has a base equal to half the base of the rectangle. The diagram shows this area as 1/4 the area of the rectangle or the triangle. Overlapping area= 0.5 * 12 cm * (16 cm / 2) = 0.5 * 12 cm * 8 cm= 48 cm^2
