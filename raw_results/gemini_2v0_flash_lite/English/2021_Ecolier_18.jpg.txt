Reasoning:
The sum of the top numbers is 7 + 5 + 4 + 2 + 8 + 3 + 2 = 31. The sum of the bottom numbers is 4 + 3 + 5 + 9 + 7 + 7 + 4 = 39.  The difference is 39 - 31 = 8. To make the sums equal, we need to reduce the bottom sum by 4 and increase the top sum by 4 (or vice versa). Let's analyze the options.

A: Turning A changes the sums by 4-7 = -3
B: Turning B changes the sums by 3-5 = -2
C: Turning D changes the sums by 5-4 = 1
D: Turning F changes the sums by 7-3 = 4. This card helps.
E: Turning G changes the sums by 4-2 = 2.

Therefore, F makes the sums equal. Let's see if we can do it:
Original Top: 31. New top: 31 + 4 = 35. Original Bottom: 39. New bottom: 39 - 4 = 35.

Answer: D)
