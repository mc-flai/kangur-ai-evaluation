Reasoning: The question states that P1 to P2015 shake hands with a number of people equal to their system number. Therefore, P1 shakes 1 hand, P2 shakes 2 hands, and so on. P2016 is not part of this rule, and the question asks how many people P2016 shakes hands with.  Since everyone from P1 to P2015 has already shaken hands with a number of people based on their index, P2016 must shake hands with P1 only.
