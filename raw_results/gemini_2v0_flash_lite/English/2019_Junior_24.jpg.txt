Reasoning: Let the side of the square be s. The radius of the circle is 1 cm. The center of the circle is at the midpoint of the diameter. Consider a right triangle formed by the center of the circle, a vertex of the square on the semicircle, and the point on the diameter where a side of the square meets the diameter. The hypotenuse of this right triangle is the radius, 1 cm. One leg is half the side of the square, s/2. The other leg is s. Using the Pythagorean theorem: (s/2)^2 + s^2 = 1^2, which simplifies to s^2/4 + s^2 = 1, or (5/4)s^2 = 1. Thus, s^2 = 4/5. The area of the square is s^2.
