Reasoning: The question asks how many numbers in the sequence 2^10, 2^11, 2^12, 2^13 are divisible by 2^10. This is equivalent to asking how many numbers in that sequence can be divided by 2^10 without a remainder.
*   2^10 / 2^10 = 1
*   2^11 / 2^10 = 2
*   2^12 / 2^10 = 4
*   2^13 / 2^10 = 8
All four numbers are divisible by 2^10.

Answer: (B)
