Reasoning: To disconnect A from B, we need to break all paths between them. Looking at the diagram, there appear to be 2 distinct paths from A to B.
One path appears to be: A -> the island just above A -> the island at top-center -> B
The other appears to be: A -> the island just below A -> B
So, by breaking the two bridges closest to A on each path it will disconnect A and B.

Answer: B)
