Reasoning: The ant starts at A, which is not one of the points P, Q, R, S, or T. Each move takes the ant to an adjacent point. Looking at the diagram, the path to go from A to any of the other points will determine the final point. In this diagram, the point Q is unique.  The other four points are all adjacent to each other. If the ant moves an odd number of times it can reach one of these four points. If the ant moves an even number of times it cannot reach these four points. Since 2019 is an odd number, the ant can be at points P, R, S, or T.  It cannot be at Q.
Answer: B)
