Reasoning:
1. Calculate how many candles were lit.
2. A candle is lit every 10 minutes.
3. After 55 minutes, the number of candles lit is 55/10 = 5.5. Since a candle needs to be completely lit, we take the integer part, which is 5.
4. Check how many candles are still lit.
5. Each candle lasts 40 minutes.
6. After 55 minutes:
   - The first candle was lit at time 0 and will be unlit after 40 minutes.
   - The second candle was lit at 10 minutes and will be unlit after 50 minutes.
   - The third candle was lit at 20 minutes and will still be lit after 55 minutes.
   - The fourth candle was lit at 30 minutes and will still be lit after 55 minutes.
   - The fifth candle was lit at 40 minutes and will still be lit after 55 minutes.
   - The sixth candle was lit at 50 minutes, but the question wants to find how many will be lit after 55 minutes.
7. There will be 3 candles still lit.
