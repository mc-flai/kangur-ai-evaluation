Reasoning: Let $n$ be the initial number of points. After the first repetition, the number of points becomes $2n-1$. After the second repetition, the number of points becomes $2(2n-1)-1 = 4n-3$. After the third repetition, the number of points becomes $2(4n-3)-1 = 8n-7$. After the fourth repetition, the number of points becomes $2(8n-7)-1 = 16n-15$. We are given that after the fourth repetition, there are 225 points. So, we set $16n-15 = 225$. Adding 15 to both sides, we get $16n = 240$. Dividing both sides by 16, we get $n = 15$.
