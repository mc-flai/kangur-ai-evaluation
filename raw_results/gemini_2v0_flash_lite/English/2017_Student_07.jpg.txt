Reasoning: The question asks which of the given larger cuboids can be built entirely out of the smaller 4x1x1 cuboids. Each small cuboid has 2 white and 2 grey cubes. The larger cuboids must have a similar ratio of white to grey cubes. Let's analyze the options:
*   **(A)** Has an equal number of white and grey cubes. It can be built.
*   **(B)** Has an equal number of white and grey cubes. It can be built.
*   **(C)** Has an equal number of white and grey cubes. It can be built.
*   **(D)** Has an equal number of white and grey cubes. It can be built.
*   **(E)** Has an equal number of white and grey cubes. It can be built.
Since all answers can be built, it is likely a mistake.

Answer: A)
