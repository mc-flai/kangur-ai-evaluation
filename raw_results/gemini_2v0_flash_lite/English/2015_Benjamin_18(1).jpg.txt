Reasoning: To guarantee having at least one apple and one pear of the same color, we need to consider the worst-case scenario.
Sebastian might first pick all the apples (3 green + 5 yellow = 8) and then all the pears of one color (7 green). At this point, he has apples of both colors, and green pears. The next fruit will necessarily be a yellow pear, giving him one apple and one pear of the same color. So he will have 8+7+1=16 pieces of fruit. However, this isn't a possible answer. So let's consider this scenario. First he picks all 5 yellow apples, 7 green pears, and 2 yellow pears which makes 5+7+2=14. The next one will be a green apple so we'll have at least one apple and pear of the same colour so that would give us 14+1=15. This isn't in the answer either. Now let's consider another scenario. Sebastian could pick all apples and all pears of one colour, for example: 5 yellow apples + 7 green pears = 12. The next fruit picked has to be either a green apple or a yellow pear, this gives us a combination of apple and pear of the same colour. 12+1 = 13.

Answer: E) 13
