Reasoning:
The question states that N is divisible by all integers from 2 to 11 except two. We are given pairs of integers. We need to find out how many of these pairs could be the two exceptions. Let us analyze each pair:
- (6,7): If 6 and 7 are excluded, then N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Since N needs to be divisible by 2, 3, and 6 at the same time, it implies that we are excluding one prime number and one composite number.
- (7,8): If 7 and 8 are excluded, then N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. Since N is divisible by 8, it also must be divisible by 2 and 4, so the pair makes sense.
- (8,9): If 8 and 9 are excluded, then N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 11. Since N is divisible by 8 and 9, the condition is valid.
- (9,10): If 9 and 10 are excluded, then N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 11. Since N is divisible by 9 and 10, this is valid.
- (10,11): If 10 and 11 are excluded, then N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. This is valid.
Each pair is a possible exception. There are five pairs given, each of which could be the exception.
