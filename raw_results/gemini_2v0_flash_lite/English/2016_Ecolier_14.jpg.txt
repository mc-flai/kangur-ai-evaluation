Reasoning: The problem states that 4 kg of fresh mushrooms yield 1 kg of dried mushrooms. To get 4 kg of dried mushrooms, we need to scale up the initial ratio by a factor of 4. Thus, we need 4 times the amount of fresh mushrooms to get 4 times the amount of dried mushrooms. So 4 kg (fresh) * 4 = 16 kg.
