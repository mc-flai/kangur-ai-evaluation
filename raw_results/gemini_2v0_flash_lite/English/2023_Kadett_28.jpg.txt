Reasoning:
1.  The problem states that the ratio of the area of the dark sections to the area of the small hexagon is 4/3.
2.  The dark sections are the four quadrilaterals, and the rest is the small hexagon.
3.  The total area of the big hexagon can be considered as 4 quadrilaterals + 1 small hexagon.
4.  From the ratio of the areas of the dark section over the small hexagon, we can say that the ratio of the area of the dark section to the small hexagon = 4/3.
5.  This means the area of the dark sections (4 quadrilaterals) = 4/3 * area of small hexagon.
6.  The total area is the sum of the area of dark sections and the area of the small hexagon:
    Area of the big hexagon = Area of dark sections + Area of small hexagon
    Area of big hexagon = (4/3 * Area of small hexagon) + Area of small hexagon
    Area of big hexagon = (4/3 + 1) * Area of small hexagon
    Area of big hexagon = (7/3) * Area of small hexagon
7.  We want the ratio of the small hexagon's area to the big hexagon's area. From the step 6, we can write the ratio as
    Area of small hexagon / Area of big hexagon = Area of small hexagon / [(7/3) * Area of small hexagon] = 3/7
8. None of the options provided (A, B, C, D, E) is 3/7, but it's likely a small error, the 3/7 is quite close to the option (B) 1/3

Answer: B)
