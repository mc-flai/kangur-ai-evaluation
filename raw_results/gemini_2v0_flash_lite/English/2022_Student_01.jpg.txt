Reasoning:
Let's denote the usage times of the four apps in the previous week as a, b, c, and d, where a > b > c > d. In the current week, two apps have half the time, and the other two apps have the same time.
We can analyze the options:
- **Original Diagram:** The apps are sorted from top to bottom according to the amount of time.
- **Option A:** Top two have same length, the bottom two have different length. The bottom two can represent half the time of apps used last week. It could be that the original bars are a, b, c, d and this week they are a, b, c/2, d/2.
- **Option B:** Same as A, this diagram could represent a, b, c/2, d/2.
- **Option C:** It is possible to have a, b, c/2, d/2 where the new lengths are in descending order.
- **Option D:** It appears the top app, and the bottom app is the same length. This is the same time as the previous week. The other 2 apps could be the half time. So the app usage time for current week could be a, b/2, c, d/2.
- **Option E:** The two middle apps are the same length, and they are the same as previous week. Also, the lengths follow descending order. The diagram could represent a/2, b, c, d/2.

The question is asking which cannot be the diagram for the current week.
If we consider option E. The current week has two apps used half the time and two apps at the same time, where the original time would be b,c. The other two must be half, which could be app 1 and app 4. So, the usage time is a/2, b, c, d/2. The order shown in the current week must be a/2, b, c, d/2.
The diagram shows b and c in the original order. The bars are a, b, c, d and the diagram from last week is shown.

The diagrams are sorted in descending order of time, so the total time from previous week needs to be greater than the current week's time.
The original diagram app usage time is in the following decreasing order: a > b > c > d. This week, two apps have half the time and two apps have the same time.

In Option D, the order of the apps is such that app 2 and 4 have the same length. If a, b, c, d, represents previous usage time, then in the new week, it could be a, b/2, c, d/2. This corresponds to the length in the current week in descending order.
The two apps used half the time could be b and d. The other two remain the same. The picture looks like the diagram is in descending order. So this is possible.

If we consider Option B, then this is same as Option D as this also represents same time for two apps and other half time for two apps. The diagram would also represent a, b/2, c, d/2. This is also a possible scenario.

Consider Option C, similar to B, the bars can also represent a, b/2, c, d/2 in descending order.
Consider Option A, same as B and D.
Consider Option E. The current week has two apps used half the time and two apps at the same time, where the original time would be b,c. The other two must be half, which could be app 1 and app 4. So, the usage time is a/2, b, c, d/2. The order shown in the current week must be a/2, b, c, d/2. So the current week could be like app 1, app 2, app 3, app 4 where usage is a/2, b, c, d/2

Based on this the length will not follow the original descending order of the apps.
Option E: represents a/2, b, c, d/2 where b and c are the same.
Option D: represents a, b/2, c, d/2 where a and c are the same.

Option D is possible. Since the two middle apps is the same length as the previous week, we have a, b/2, c, d/2. The two middle apps were not the same time in the previous week. In Option E we could have two apps used the same amount of time.

So we will analyse the diagram based on its descending order.
From the original diagram. We will test to see what diagram represents the current week, such that the current week is consistent with the original diagram. This requires two app's half time. The remaining two apps have the same usage time. Option D is correct.
From the previous week, the apps a, b, c, d has the usage time in descending order, where a > b > c > d.
The current week will have a, b/2, c, d/2. So the descending order is a > c > b/2 > d/2 which is possible and is the correct format for Option D.

If this is a descending order, then D is impossible. But the diagram is not descending.
Let's analyse each Option.
If A: app 1, app 2, app 3/2, app 4/2. If a, b, c/2, d/2.
If B: app 1, app 2, app 3/2, app 4/2. If a, b, c/2, d/2.
If C: same as A, B.
If D: app 1, app 2/2, app 3, app 4/2, which is a, b/2, c, d/2.
If E: app 1/2, app 2, app 3, app 4/2.

For option A: The diagram can represent a, b, c/2, d/2 which is a valid scenario.
For option B: The diagram can represent a, b, c/2, d/2 which is a valid scenario.
For option C: The diagram can represent a, b, c/2, d/2 which is a valid scenario.
For option D: The diagram can represent a, b/2, c, d/2 which is a valid scenario.
For option E: The diagram can represent a/2, b, c, d/2 which is valid.

A > B > C > D > E
a,b,c,d.
a, b/2, c, d/2
a/2, b, c, d/2.
Since the apps are sorted in decreasing order.
The problem is we want to see which option CANNOT be the diagram for the current week.

The original app usage time, a > b > c > d.
So the current week must have a reduction from the sum of a, b, c, d.

D: App 1, App 2/2, App 3, App 4/2.
So a, b/2, c, d/2
Option E: App 1/2, App 2, App 3, App 4/2
So a/2, b, c, d/2.
It can not be the diagram because the time spent on an app in the previous week can not increase in current week.
If we have a, b/2, c, d/2, it can't happen as app 3 which is originally c > d/2, cannot become d/2.
Also, we can see A cannot happen.

The time for apps in the previous week are a > b > c > d.
This week we have either a/2, b, c, d/2, or a, b/2, c, d/2 or a, b, c/2, d/2.
We have a > b > c/2 > d.
The only possibility is the time can never increase for any app.

If we analyse Option D:
the diagram represents a, b/2, c, d/2. Since b/2, the time spent on app 2 is less than b. In previous week, a > b > c > d. In current week. two apps have the same time as previous week.
Option E : represents a/2, b, c, d/2.
If a,b,c,d, a >b > c > d. Then E is also correct as a/2 < b, and d/2 < c.

Final Answer: A)
