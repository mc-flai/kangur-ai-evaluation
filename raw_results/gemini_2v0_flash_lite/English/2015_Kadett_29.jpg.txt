Reasoning: The remainder when dividing by a number is always less than that number. Therefore, the largest possible remainder is one less than the divisor. We are looking for the largest possible remainder Maria notes down. The divisors range from 1 to 1000. The largest remainder will occur when dividing by a divisor that is close to the number. Considering the divisors, the biggest possible remainder when dividing 2015 by any number 'n' will always be less than n.
The maximum remainder Maria will get will be if she's dividing by a number close to 2015/2 = 1007. Since the divisors go up to 1000, the largest remainder occurs when dividing by numbers larger than 1007, so the greatest remainder will be when the division involves the largest divisor which is 1000. So the remainder when dividing 2015 by 1000 is 15. The remainder when dividing by 1 is zero, when dividing 2015 by 2, we get 1.
Consider the case where the divisor is 1000. The remainder when 2015 is divided by 1000 is 15.
Therefore, the biggest remainder will be 15.
