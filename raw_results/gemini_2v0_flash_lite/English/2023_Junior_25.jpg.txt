Reasoning: Let's denote the time spent on each activity (phoning, surfing, and not using) as 'x'.  Since the battery is half-full initially, the total battery usage on the train ride is equivalent to half of a fully charged battery.  The battery usage rates are: phoning uses 1/32 of the battery per hour, surfing uses 1/20 of the battery per hour, and not using the phone uses 1/80 of the battery per hour. The total battery usage during the train ride is given by x/32 + x/20 + x/80. Since the battery starts at half full, and is empty at the end of the train ride the following equation must be satisfied: x/32 + x/20 + x/80 = 1/2. Find a common denominator (160) so you can solve for x: 5x/160 + 8x/160 + 2x/160 = 1/2 or 15x/160 = 1/2. Thus 15x = 80 and x = 80/15 = 16/3.  The total time of the train ride is 3x since x is spent on each activity, therefore 3 * (16/3) = 16.
