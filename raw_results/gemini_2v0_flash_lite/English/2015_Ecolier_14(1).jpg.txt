Reasoning:
Peter starts at S. He turns right, then left, right, and then left. Following the instructions, Peter's path is as follows:
1. Starts at S.
2. First right turn: He goes to A.
3. Second left turn: He goes to D.
4. Third right turn: Goes back to A,
5. Fourth left turn: Reaches D.
He does not reach B, C, or E. Since the question asks which he does not reach, and B, C, and E are listed as options, any of the options is possible. I choose B, since it comes first.

Answer: B)
