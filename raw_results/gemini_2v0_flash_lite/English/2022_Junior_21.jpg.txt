Reasoning: The sum of six consecutive integers can be represented as (n) + (n+1) + (n+2) + (n+3) + (n+4) + (n+5) = 6n + 15, where n is an integer. This means the sum must always be divisible by 3 since we can factor out a 3 from 6n and 15. More specifically, the sum will always have a remainder of 0 when divided by 3. Let's check the given options:
(A) 95: 95/3 = 31 with a remainder of 2. Cannot be the sum.
(B) 125: 125/3 = 41 with a remainder of 2. Cannot be the sum.
(C) 167: 167/3 = 55 with a remainder of 2. Cannot be the sum.
(D) 205: 205/3 = 68 with a remainder of 1. Cannot be the sum.
(E) 233: 233/3 = 77 with a remainder of 2. Cannot be the sum.
Since all options are incorrect, we consider that there may be an error in the question setup, or that one of the numbers can be an integer. For example, option (C) 167 can not be obtained from the sum of 6 consecutive integers, with the result being 6n+15=167 and n being non integer.
If the problem would have been "Which of the following numbers can be the sum of the six answers?", any option of the form 6n+15 is accepted.
Thus we choose the value with a remainder different from zero (which would then be accepted in a correct problem setup).

Answer: D)
