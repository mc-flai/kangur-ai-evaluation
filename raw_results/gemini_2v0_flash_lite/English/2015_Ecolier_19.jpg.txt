Reasoning: The problem states that the sum of the horizontal and vertical rows must be equal. Also, the middle square belongs to both the horizontal and vertical sums. Since the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9, the sums must add up to the same number. The middle number influences both the row and the column, so it needs to be a number that provides flexibility in achieving a common sum. If 2, 3, 4, or 1 are in the middle, a combination cannot be made to equalize the sums. However, if 9 is in the middle, then the other values can be assigned.
Let's try 9 in the middle. The total of all numbers is 1+2+3+4+9 = 19. Because the center number is counted in both directions, each row (horizontal or vertical) sums to 9. 9 + 0= 9. The other numbers are arranged to yield 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 and 2 + 4 + 9= 15. However, none of the available numbers give a sum of 9. The numbers are used and assigned correctly in the diagram to meet the condition:
Horizontal: 2 + 9 + 4 = 15
Vertical: 1 + 9 + 3 = 13
This approach is not accurate and the numbers will not add up to a common value.

If 3 is in the middle, then the other values can be assigned:
Horizontal: 1+3+9= 13
Vertical: 2+3+4 = 9

If 4 is in the middle:
Horizontal: 1+4+9=14
Vertical: 2+4+3=9

If 2 is in the middle
Horizontal: 1+2+9=12
Vertical: 4+2+3=9

By inspection, only option (C) 3 works
Horizontal sum = 1+3+9 = 13
Vertical sum = 2+3+4 = 9

Therefore if 3 is in the middle:
2 + 3 + 4 = 9.
1 + 3 + 9 = 13

If 4 is in the middle,
1 + 4 + 9 = 14
2 + 4 + 3 = 9

The sums have to be the same, meaning 9 is in the middle.
9 needs to be in the middle and then 1 + 4 + 9 = 14 and 2 + 9 + 3 = 14

Let's try a different approach: The only possible answers are 1, 2, 3, 4 or 9. If 1, 2, 3, or 4 are in the center then the other numbers need to sum to make the sum equal. For the sums to be equal the answer is 3 because:
1+9+3 = 13
2+3+4 = 9

Answer: E) 9
Reasoning: If we place 9 in the center, we can arrange the remaining numbers so that the horizontal and vertical sums are equal. Specifically, consider the horizontal row: If we put 2, 9 and 4, the sum is 15. For the vertical row, we would have 1, 9 and 3, with a sum of 13. Since the sums are not the same, the answer cannot be 9.
If we put 3 in the middle
2 + 3 + 4 = 9.
1 + 3 + 9 = 13
If 4 is in the middle:
1 + 4 + 9 = 14
2 + 4 + 3 = 9.
This is not the correct answer

If the question states that both sums are the same, the answer has to be 3 since:
2 + 3 + 4 = 9
1 + 3 + 9 = 13.

Answer: C) 3
