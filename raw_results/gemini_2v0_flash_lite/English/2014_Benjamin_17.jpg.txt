Reasoning:
The problem states that when Lea divides her marbles into groups of 3 or groups of 5, there are always 2 marbles left over. This means that the number of marbles Lea has is 2 more than a multiple of 3 and 5.
The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5 is 15. So, the number of marbles Lea has can be expressed as 15k + 2, where k is a non-negative integer.

If k = 0, the number of marbles = 2. However, she would not have the necessary amount.
If k = 1, the number of marbles = 15 + 2 = 17.
To avoid any marbles left over, the number of marbles has to be a multiple of both 3 and 5, which means the number of marbles needs to be a multiple of 15. The closest multiple of 15 that is larger than 17 is 3 * 5=15. Thus 15 is the closest number of marbles that she can equally group.
Since her number of marbles has a remainder of 2. Then she needs to add an amount that can be added to the initial marbles of 2 so that the resulting amount is a multiple of 15. Therefore, she needs to add 13 (15-2=13).
