Reasoning: First, we factor 33. 33 = 3 * 11 * 1.  Since N, U are multiplied, they have to be factors.
We can write the equation as N * U * (M+B+E+R) = 33, which simplifies to: 3 * 11 * 1 = 33.
Since N, U, and (M+B+E+R) must be different digits between 0-9. One of them must be 1. The sum (M+B+E+R) should be between 0 to 36, but none of the individual digits can be zero (because they have to be different, so the product can't be 0).
So, we can let N = 3, U = 11 or U= 1, (M+B+E+R)= 1.
If the product is 3 * 1 * 11 = 33. Since the sum of digits should be 11. Then N = 3, U = 1 and M+B+E+R=11, or U=11, N=3, M+B+E+R = 1.
We want to know how many combinations there can be in which we can assign numbers to each of the variables.
N and U must be 3 and 11. However 11 is invalid. So, possible assignments are : N=3, U=1, and M+B+E+R = 11.
If we have the number 1, 3, 11, then we have to choose from the remaining digits to be 1, 3, and the rest add up to 11.
Since it is not a standard approach, there has to be a simplification to the values to make the assignment easier. Let N = 3, U = 1. Then M+B+E+R = 11.
Since all the digits must be unique, we can look at different combinations for M, B, E and R that would give 11. They must be different digits from 0-9, but they cannot be 1 or 3 since those are already assigned.
Some possible combinations for M, B, E, R are:
0, 2, 4, 5.
0, 2, 3, 6.
0, 2, 8, 1. etc.
However, M, B, E, and R can take the digit of 0, 2, 4 and 5 in any order, so 4!= 24 different possible combinations, therefore it is equivalent to say that we can also replace the digits in any order, where each has its own place. Since we have 4 digits, we can assign any of the 4 to any position so 4! = 4*3*2*1 = 24 ways to replace.
However, we still have to account for the combination of N, U, for example:
N*U= 3*1. There are 2 arrangements possible.
The equation becomes 24.
Answer: B)
    Reasoning: The factors of 33 are 1, 3, and 11.  Since the sum of M+B+E+R must be an integer and 11 must be one of the values, N, U are 3 and 1. Then, the sum of the digits should be 11. We can assign the remaining digits to 4 different variables, with the restriction that the assigned values must be unique.
    Answer: (B)
