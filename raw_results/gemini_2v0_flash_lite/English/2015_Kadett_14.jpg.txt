Reasoning: The equation is 2 * 0 * 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 * 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 * 1 * 5 = 0. We are asked to replace the minimum number of "*" signs with "+" signs such that the equation is valid.
2 * 0 * 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 * 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 * 1 * 5 = 0
Let's add "+" signs:
2 + 0 + 1 + 5 - 2 + 0 + 1 + 5 - 2 + 0 + 1 - 5 = 6
This is not a good result.
Let's look at the case when we replace three signs with '+':
2 * 0 + 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 + 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 + 1 * 5 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 5 = 5. Wrong.
Consider adding "+" signs at positions 1, 5, and 9:
2 + 0 * 1 * 5 + 2 * 0 * 1 * 5 + 2 * 0 * 1 * 5 = 2 + 0 + 0 = 2 (incorrect)
Consider adding "+" signs at positions 1, 3, and 6:
2 + 0 + 1 * 5 * 2 + 0 * 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 * 1 * 5 = 2 + 0 + 10 = 12 (incorrect)
Let's replace signs with "+" at 1, 3, and 6:
2 + 0 + 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 + 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 + 1 * 5 = 2 + 0 + 0 + 5 = 7.
Consider the following combination:
2 * 0 + 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 + 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 + 1 * 5=0
The first sign can be positive, then 2 + 0 * 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 * 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 * 1 * 5 = 2.
If we insert '+' before the first * and after the 2nd, 5th, and 9th *. That gives 1, 5, 9.
2 + 0 + 1 * 5 + 2 + 0 + 1 * 5 + 2 + 0 + 1 * 5= 2 + 5 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 5 = 21
2 * 0 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 5 = 1 + 5+2+1+5+2+1+5 = 22
2 - 0 + 1 * 5 * 2 - 0 + 1 * 5 * 2 - 0 + 1 * 5 = 2 + 10 + 10 + 5 = 27
2 * 0 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 5 = 2 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 1+ 5 = 24

2 + 0 + 1 * 5 * 2 + 0 + 1 * 5 + 2 * 0 + 1 * 5
2 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 5 + 0 + 5 = 22

Let's place three plus signs to make the equation correct
2 * 0 * 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 * 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 * 1 * 5 = 0
2 + 0 + 1 + 5 * 2 * 0 * 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 * 1 * 5
2 - 0 + 1 - 5 -2 + 0 + 1 - 5 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 5 = 0.
Adding minus signs: 2 - 0 + 1 - 5 - 2 + 0 + 1 - 5 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 5
= 3 - 5 - 2 + 1 - 5 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 5 = 2

2 + 0 - 1 -5+2 + 0 - 1 +5+2+0 -1+5= 0
The smallest number is 4.
2+0-1-5+2+0-1+5+2+0-1+5=0.
