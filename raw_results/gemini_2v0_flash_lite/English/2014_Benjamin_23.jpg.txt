Reasoning: Let the three single-digit numbers Mia writes be x, y, and z. Ali adds them and gets 15, so x + y + z = 15. Ali replaces one of the numbers (let's say x) with 3. Then, Resi multiplies the new three numbers, so 3 * y * z = 36, which simplifies to y * z = 12.  We need to find pairs of single-digit integers (y, z) that multiply to 12. Possible pairs are (3, 4), (4, 3), (2, 6), (6, 2). The original sum, x + y + z = 15, must be true.  If we have the pair (3, 4), then x + 3 + 4 = 15 which means x = 8.  If we have the pair (2,6), then x + 2 + 6 = 15, so x = 7. The deleted number (x) could be 8 or 7.

Answer: B)
