Reasoning: The seven-digit phone number has 7 digits. We know 6 of them, and the position they're in.  The missing digit could be in any of the 7 positions, and it could be any of the 10 digits (0-9).  For each of the 7 possible positions, we must try all 10 digits, so for any missing digit we could have up to 10 tries. Thus, we have 7 positions * 10 digits = 70 possible tries.
