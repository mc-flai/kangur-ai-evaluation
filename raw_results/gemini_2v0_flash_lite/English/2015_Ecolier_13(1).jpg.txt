Reasoning: The problem states the ship and the teddy bear must be next to the car. Let's consider the car (C), ship (S), and teddy bear (T) as a single unit, meaning they must stay together. Then we have (C, S, T), and a ball (B) to arrange.
We can have (C, S, T) in different orders like:
- C S T
- C T S
- S C T
- T C S
There are 4 arrangements for the car, ship and teddy bear. The ball can be on either side.
The arrangements are:
1. B, C, S, T
2. B, C, T, S
3. B, S, C, T
4. B, T, C, S
5. C, S, T, B
6. C, T, S, B
7. S, C, T, B
8. T, C, S, B

We can arrange (C, S, T) and B as two units, and arrange those in 2! = 2 ways. The toys (C, S, T) have to stay together and we have to arrange the 3 toys with the ball (B). The car, teddy bear, ship can be arranged in 2 different ways:
- C, S, T
- C, T, S
The car, teddy bear, ship can be treated as one unit and B, so total 2!*2! = 4 different orders.
The possible arrangements are:
1. B, (C, S, T): ball, car, ship, teddy bear
2. B, (C, T, S): ball, car, teddy bear, ship
3. (C, S, T), B: car, ship, teddy bear, ball
4. (C, T, S), B: car, teddy bear, ship, ball
We must treat car, teddy bear, ship as one unit. Then we can arrange the unit and the ball.
Case 1: Car, Ship, Teddy Bear (CST)
* B, CST
* CST, B
* B, TSC
* TSC, B
Since the teddy bear and ship can change order.
Therefore, we have to consider the different orders in CST:
C, S, T or C, T, S and S, C, T and T, C, S.
Car, Ship, Teddy bear can be in two different orders: CST, CTS.
We have a unit (car, ship, teddy bear) which is next to each other and ball. So unit-ball or ball-unit.
Let the unit = U. The arrangements are:
* B, U (2 arrangements)
* U, B (2 arrangements)
The car, teddy bear, ship can be arranged in 2 ways.
So total = 2*2 = 4

Answer: B)
