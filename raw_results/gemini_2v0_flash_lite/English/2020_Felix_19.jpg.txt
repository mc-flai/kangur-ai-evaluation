Reasoning:
1.  **Square Chocolates:** Tania bought 14 chocolates and 8 were round, so 14 - 8 = 6 were square.
2.  **White vs. Dark:** Half the chocolates were white and half were dark, so 14 / 2 = 7 were white and 7 were dark.
3.  **Square Chocolates and Color:** Among the 6 square chocolates, 2 are not white. This means 2 are dark. The other 4 must be white, because all the square chocolates are either white or dark.
4.  **Round Chocolates:** We need to find out how many dark round chocolates there are. There are 7 dark chocolates total. We know there are 2 dark square chocolates. This means there are 7 - 2 = 5 dark round chocolates.
