Reasoning: The sum of the numbers from 1 to 9 is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45. The grid has 3 rows and 3 columns. The sums of the rows and columns are six numbers in total. Let the six sums be a, b, c, d, e, and f. The sum of all the numbers in the grid is equal to the sum of each row and column (a+b+c+d+e+f). So, the sum of all sums of row and columns has to be 45 x 2 = 90 because we are summing up the rows and columns each with sum = 45. The question says that 5 of the sums are 12, 13, 15, 16, and 17. Let f be the unknown sum. Then 12 + 13 + 15 + 16 + 17 + f = 90.
Therefore, 73 + f = 90. So, f = 90-73 = 17.
