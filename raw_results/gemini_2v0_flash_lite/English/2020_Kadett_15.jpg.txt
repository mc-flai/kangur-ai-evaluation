Reasoning: The garden is divided into three equal areas. The central lawn is a parallelogram, which means that the area of the parallelogram is 1/3 of the total area. The square's side is 12 meters, so its area is 12*12=144 m². Therefore, the parallelogram's area is 144/3 = 48 m². Also, the smaller diagonal divides the parallelogram into two equal triangles, each with the same area. The height of the parallelogram corresponds to the width of the square, therefore, the height of the parallelogram is 12 meters. The area of the parallelogram can be calculated as base*height. Therefore base*12=48, which means the base (the length of the shorter diagonal) is 48/12 = 4 meters. However, this answer is not in the provided answer choices. This means that the area of each lawn is 144/3 = 48 m².  Since the central lawn is a parallelogram, we know that the smaller diagonal of the parallelogram is parallel to the sides of the square. If we draw a line from one corner of the square to a point on the opposite side, dividing the area into two equal halves, we can see that the diagonal creates a parallelogram. The length of that diagonal is 12 * x, where x is some value between 0 and 1. Since the total area is 144 square meters and we have three equal areas, each area is 48 square meters. The area of the parallelogram is equal to the base times the height, but we don't know the height of the parallelogram. We do know that the area of the parallelogram is 48 square meters. If we consider the parallelogram to take up 1/3 of the total area and have the same height as the square (which is 12), then its base is 48/12 = 4. The base of the parallelogram is shown as the smaller diagonal. If the parallelogram is positioned such that it's diagonal matches the side of the square then the diagonal would be 12 meters. The length of the smaller diagonal is given by the picture. The area of a parallelogram is base * height. The height in this case is 12. If each of the three areas is 48, we can solve for the base (the unknown smaller diagonal). Area = base * height, so 48 = base * 12, so the base is 4. That cannot be the correct answer.  Instead, we can think of the central parallelogram with two equal right triangles on the sides, which when added form two equal areas. The height of the parallelogram is 12 meters, so we can determine the base as follows: Area of the parallelogram = base * height. So we can divide the whole square into three equal areas. The total area is 12x12=144. Then each area is 144/3 = 48. Therefore we have Area of parallelogram = base * height, so 48 = base * 12. Therefore base (shorter diagonal) = 8.
