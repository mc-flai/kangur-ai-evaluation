Reasoning: Tick, Trick, and Track are triplets, meaning they have the same age. Franz is 3 years older than the triplets. To find the total age, we can assume the triplets are all 1 year old, so the triplets' total age is 1+1+1=3. Franz is 3 years older than the triplets, so he is 1+3=4 years old. The total age is 3+4=7. However, the answer options do not include this. We can repeat this calculation, this time assuming that the triplets are all 8 years old. So, the triplets' ages sum to 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 years old, and Franz is 8 + 3 = 11 years old. The total is then 24 + 11 = 35, but this is also not an answer option. Another calculation can be performed, assuming the triplets are x years old. In this case the answer is 3x + (x+3) = 4x + 3. Plugging each option into the equation and solving for x allows us to find the correct answer.

A) 4x + 3 = 25, so 4x = 22, and x = 5.5, not a whole number
B) 4x + 3 = 27, so 4x = 24, and x = 6, a whole number
C) 4x + 3 = 29, so 4x = 26, and x = 6.5, not a whole number
D) 4x + 3 = 30, so 4x = 27, and x = 6.75, not a whole number
E) 4x + 3 = 60, so 4x = 57, and x = 14.25, not a whole number

Based on this calculation the answer must be B, as the triplets would be 6, 6, and 6, and Franz would be 9. 6 + 6 + 6 + 9 = 27

Answer: B)
