Reasoning:
The sum of three numbers is odd if either all three are odd, or if two are even and one is odd.
The center circle is part of all the sums, and has to be odd. The smallest possible sum will be when we use the smallest numbers possible, i.e. 0, 1, and 2. Therefore the center number should be 1, and the sum is 0 + 1 + 2 = 3.
The next smallest sum is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.
The greatest possible value for one of the sums is achieved when the center circle has value 1 and we try to maximize the numbers chosen for each line of the diameter. We have to use odd numbers to make the sum odd. Then we need to choose 1 as the center number and use as many large odd numbers as possible. The remaining values would be 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. If the smallest sum is as small as possible, say 3, the next sums could look like: 1+0+2 = 3.
1+3+4=8 (wrong)
1+3+6 = 10 (wrong)
If we maximize the numbers on the line, we could try:
1+8+10 = 19
1+7+9 = 17
1+5+6 = 12 (wrong)
We can assign the numbers in such a way that the sums are odd. If we use center 1, then we would need the sums to be odd and we must avoid two even or two odd numbers.
If we have:
1+0+2 = 3,
1+4+6 = 11
1+8+10 = 19
1+3+5 = 9
1+7+9 = 17
Thus, one of the possible largest sums would be 19.
