Reasoning:
Let 'j' be the weight of the jar, and 'w' be the weight of water that fills the jar.
We are given two equations:
1. j + (1/5)w = 560
2. j + (4/5)w = 740
Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2), we get:
(3/5)w = 180
Multiplying by 5/3, we get:
w = 300
Substitute w=300 into equation (1):
j + (1/5)*300 = 560
j + 60 = 560
j = 500

Answer: E)
