Reasoning: The net of the box is shown. By folding the net into a 2x1x1 box we can see how each picture can or cannot represent it. By comparing the side colors with the net image, we see the following:
- A is the top part of the net and shows the front and right side of the box.
- B is the top part of the net showing the left and the front side.
- C is a correct representation of the sides that can be viewed.
- D is a correct representation of the sides that can be viewed.
- E is a correct representation of the sides that can be viewed.

Comparing the net image to the image provided, the sides shown in picture A, B, C, D, and E do show the same views when the cardboard is folded.

Answer: None of the options do not show the box, which is why there might be a mistake in the question. I am assuming there's a mistake in the question, and I'm unable to decide between options.
