Reasoning:
1.  Find the width of the top-left rectangle: Area = 18, Height = 6, therefore Width = 18/6 = 3 cm.
2.  Find the width of the middle rectangle: The top rectangle has an area of 32, so the width is 32/6.
3.  The width of the right-hand rectangle is 30/x where x is the height we are trying to find.
4. The width of the top right and middle rectangles sum up to be the same as the width of the bottom right rectangles.
5. So 3 + 32/6 = 30/x. Then 18/6 + 32/6 = 30/x, and 50/6 = 30/x.
6. Cross multiply and get 50x = 180, and therefore x = 180/50 = 3.6.
7.  This is an incorrect approach.  The two left side rectangles have a combined width.
8. Let's find the width of the rectangle below 18cm^2, so the height of the rectangles beside 18 cm^2 is 12, so the width is 12/x.
9. The width of the rectangle below 32cm^2 is 16, so the width is 16/x.
10. The width of the rectangle below 48cm^2 is 30, so the height is 30/x.
11. Since the width of the first column is 3, and the width of the next rectangle is 32/6, we also know this width: 16/x + 30/x = 3 + 32/6 = 18/6+32/6 = 50/6 = 25/3
12.  Therefore, x = 16/25*3 + 30/25*3  => x(16+30) = 75 => 36/75, which is still incorrect.
13. We know the height of the top left rectangle is 6cm and the area is 18cm2, meaning the width is 3cm.
14. The middle top rectangle has area 32cm2, meaning the width of the middle column is 32/6 = 16/3cm.
15. Therefore, the width of the third column is 30/x cm (x = height to find) and it must equal 3 + 16/3, or 9/3 + 16/3 = 25/3.
16. Find the height of the bottom left rectangle using the height and the area: Height = 6. Area = 12cm2. Width = 12/x. So the width is 2cm.
17. From the middle top rectangle, the width is 32/6 and the bottom middle one is 16/x, and these widths add up to same number.
18.  Width of the top right rectangle is 48/6, width = 8cm. Then the width of the bottom right is 30/x, which we can determine because the width = 8cm, the area is 30cm2, so the missing height would be 30/x = width of the third column. Then width of the third column, 3 + 16/3 = 25/3.
19. From bottom right rectangle has area of 30. From top right one, has width = 8. But the width of the rectangle below 32 is 16.
20. the width of the first rectangle is 3. Then the width of the second is 32/6 = 16/3. Third column must also have the same width and have a 30cm area.
21. Width = 30/x. 30/x = 3+ 16/3. 30/x = 25/3. Cross multiply and get 90 = 25x, x = 90/25, which is still not one of the options.
22. We have a height of 6cm, area is 18 cm^2, so its width is 3. The one beside it has a height of 6, but area is 32, so width is 32/6 or 16/3.
23. Then below the rectangle of 32, we know the area is 16, with the width being 30/x. We also know that 16/x has the same x. Therefore the width is 3. Then height is 12/x, area is 12, so x is 16/3 + 30/x = 3 + 32/6 => 16/3
24. Bottom right height = x. Area = 30. The sum of width is 3 + (32/6)
25. The width from the area of 12, has a height of x, Area = 12, so width = 12/x.
26. From area of 30: 30/x. Width = 3+ 16/3  => 30/x = 25/3. Then x = 90/25 = 3.6. Still incorrect.
27. Area = 32. Width = 16/3. Rectangle next to area 30 and the dimensions must match with the adjacent areas.
28. So the height is 6, the area is 32. The area is 16. The width is 30/x where x is the required height. Also from the 3 rectangles on left.
29. So the width from top right is 32/6 and bottom right is 30/x. From area 48, width is 8.
30.  The width from the top rectangle is 16/3 + 30/x.
31. From the area of 18: 18 = 6 * 3. From area of 12, width is 2.
32. Width is 2 and 3. Third col = 3+16/3.
33. The width 2 + 16/x + 30/x
34. 2+16/x = 3. Widths must add up.
35. Area of 30, height is x. area is 30, width is 30/x.
36. Area = 30. The width of the area is 30/x. so 30/x = 32/6.
37. height from the area of 18cm2 is 6cm. Width is 3.
38. 12cm2 has a width of 2. The width of the top is 3 + 16/3.
39. The widths must add up to the next. Area of 30.
40. width = 2. top middle rectangle with area of 32. Area 16
41. From top left rectangle with width of 3, 18cm2, so width is 3. The total height must also be same.
42. Area 30 and x = 30.
43. Width is 3 + 32/6, which must also mean, area of 30, so 30/x = 3 + 32/6.
44. From rectangle of area 48.
45. height is x. Width is the same. Width 12.
46. The top-left rectangle has a height of 6, and area of 18, so width is 3.
47. The rectangle above area 48 has height 6, and area is 48, so width = 8.
48. Area 30 is next to rectangle with area 48, and this means area 48 has a width of 8, the height is 6. 18 has width of 3, and 12 has width of 2.
49. rectangle with area 16 has height of x and the rectangle with area 30 has height of x. The rectangles must also have the same widths.
50. Then from area of 16, the width must be 16/x, then 30/x.
51. Area of 30, height is x. the total width = 8, which also = 2 + 16/x.
52. width is 8. The height is 12, area is 12 so width is 2. Rectangle 16, width 16/x. Area 30 width 30/x.
53. So 8 = 2 + 16/x. Then 6 = 16/x, or x = 16/6 = 8/3
54. From the area 48, width is 8. from rectangle of area 16. Width is 16/x, area 30. Width is 30/x. Then we know that the total widths must add up.
55. So if the width of the right column is 8, then we can deduce. Area 16, we have x * width, so 16/x. Then we get 2 + 16/x.
56. Total width is 8. From area of 16 + area 30. width from the area is 30/x and 16/x.
57. So 8 = 2 + 16/x. So 6 = 16/x. From that, we can get x = 8/3.  8 - 2 = 16/x.
58.  Top has area 18, width 3. Area 48, width 8. Bottom has 2 and 30.
59. Then total width is 8. then 30/x + 16/x = 8-2.
60. x-2 and +30/x, so 2+16/x=8.
61. From the bottom right, height x. The sum of all the areas. 16+30/x=8
62. So 30/x = 8.
63. So width is 8, x = 30/8.  6-18, 12 = 2. 8 = area 48
64. 48 = 6*8.
65. So area 48 has a width of 8.
66. Total width is 8.
67. Area 30. 30/x. then total area is 16. and the total of 2+16/x = 8.
68. 30/x + 16/x = 8-2=6. So 30/x is = 6. 16/x = 2x = 30/6 =5cm
69. 12/x.
70. The total of 2+16/x = 8. so 30/x.
71. Area 30 is beside area 48. Width is 8.
72. Widths must add up to area of 8
73. From area of 30.
74. Total width = 8. From area 16, area 30
75. x = 5.
76. Widths are 8, with 30, and area 16. Total width is 8. so bottom right rectangle, has a width of 8-2 = 6. 30/x and 16/x
77. the width from area of 30 is 30/x, the area is 16 so 16/x.
78. 2+ 16/x = 8. 30/x + 16/x  = 8-2.  16/x + 30/x. 16/x = 6/8.
79. so 30/x + 16/x. Total width is 8. The rectangles adjacent to each other must add up.
80. The width is 8. The height is x. Area is 30. area 16, and 2. So we know this.
81. 16/x. So the rectangles. 2 + 16/x.
82. The height is 30. The height can be found as 30/x.
83. If width is 8 from the top. Then it is 2. The base of the 48cm^2 is 8, so this is also equivalent to 30 and 16 and is equivalent.
84. the total. From area of 48, the height is 6 and area = 48. So it is 8
85. Then 8 from width is 8.  Area 30. 8. Then 16/x + 30/x = 6cm
86. So 16 + 30.
87. The area of 30 is 5. From this. and height is 6
88. From area 48, width 8. The area 16 and 30.
89. 8-2 = 16/x =6.
90. So 30/x + 16/x.
91. So 2 + 16/x. then 30/x. 16/x + 30/x
92. So from this,  The width can be determined as area 30
93. From this. The height can be found from this. Area 16 + 30.
94. So x. The area of 30 is 5, with width 30/x. Width of 30 = 5.
95. Then 2 + 16/x = 8 or 6.
96.  From top, is 6. Area of 30 is 5. width = 5, so 2 + 16/x = 5
97. So the rectangle with area 16 has width of 2. 30/x, area is 30.
98. area = 30. From this, 30. width is 5. x = 5cm.
