Reasoning: There are 12 children total. Susi is 7th from the front and Kim is 2nd from the back. This means there is 1 person behind Kim.
Total children - Susi's position - Kim's position from the back - 1 person behind Kim = number of people between Susi and Kim
12 (total children) - 7 (Susi's position from the front) - 1 (Kim's position from the back) - 1 (Kim himself)= 3.

Answer: B)
