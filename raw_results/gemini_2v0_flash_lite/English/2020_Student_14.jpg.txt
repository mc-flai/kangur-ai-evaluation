Reasoning:
The given equation is the sum of three squares equals zero. Since squares of real numbers are non-negative, this means each term must be zero:
(a - a⁻¹)² = 0 => a - 1/a = 0 => a² - 1 = 0 => a = 1 or a = -1
Similarly, b = 1 or b = -1
And c = 1 or c = -1
The question asks which of the provided sums is impossible.  Let's check the possibilities for a + b + c:
If a=b=c=1, a+b+c = 3
If a=1, b=1, c=-1, a+b+c = 1
If a=1, b=-1, c=-1, a+b+c = -1
If a=b=c=-1, a+b+c = -3
Therefore, any values other than -3, -1, 1, or 3 are not possible.
