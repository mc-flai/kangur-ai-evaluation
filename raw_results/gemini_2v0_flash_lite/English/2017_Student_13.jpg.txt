Reasoning: Let $r_A$ and $h_A$ be the radius and height of cylinder A, and $r_B$ and $h_B$ be the radius and height of cylinder B. The volume of a cylinder is given by $V = \pi r^2 h$. Since the volumes are the same, $V_A = V_B$, so $\pi r_A^2 h_A = \pi r_B^2 h_B$. The radius of B is 10% bigger than A, so $r_B = 1.1 r_A$. Substituting this into the volume equation:
$\pi r_A^2 h_A = \pi (1.1 r_A)^2 h_B$
$r_A^2 h_A = 1.21 r_A^2 h_B$
$h_A = 1.21 h_B$
This means the height of A is 1.21 times the height of B. We want to find how much greater the height of A is than B. This is given by $\frac{h_A - h_B}{h_B} \times 100\%$.
$\frac{1.21 h_B - h_B}{h_B} \times 100\% = \frac{0.21 h_B}{h_B} \times 100\% = 0.21 \times 100\% = 21\%$.
