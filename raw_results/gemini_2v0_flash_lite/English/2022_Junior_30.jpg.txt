Reasoning:
Let the diameter of the hemispherical holes be d. The side length of the cube is 2. The center of the hole is the midpoint of each face. Since each hemisphere touches each adjacent hemisphere in exactly one point, we can form a right triangle from the centers of three adjacent hemispherical holes (along three perpendicular edges meeting at a vertex of the cube). The distance between the centers of two adjacent holes is d. The distance along the diagonal from a corner, passing through the center of the cube, and ending at another corner, can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. Consider two adjacent holes, the distance between their centers is 'd' and the distance between the centers of two holes along the diagonal is d * sqrt(2). The length of the cube side is 2. This also means the distances between centers of holes is d, when the holes are on adjacent faces.
We can consider a triangle formed by the center of the cube and the centers of two adjacent hemispheres along an edge. If the center of the cube is the origin and (1,1,1) is one corner, then the center of one hemisphere will be (0,1,1). We consider three adjacent hemispheres along the vertex. Let the radius be r. Then the coordinate can be (r, r, 0) if they are on the faces that meet at the bottom edge. Then the distance between any two adjacent faces is 2r. Thus, 2r*sqrt(2) = 2, and r*sqrt(2) is 1. Then 2r is sqrt(2) or the diameter of the holes is sqrt(2).
Let r be the radius of each hemisphere.
If we consider the line connecting the centers of two hemispheres on adjacent faces, the distance between the centers is the radius of each hemisphere.
Also, when connecting the centers of the three hemispheres that meet at a corner of the cube, we get an equilateral triangle. Distance between the centers is d, and the length of the diagonal connecting two opposite corners is 2.
Consider the diagonal of the cube, which is the distance between the centers of two opposite hemispheres is 2.
The space diagonal is d*sqrt(3).
Since the holes are equally sized, d*sqrt(3) = 2
The distance between the centers of three adjacent holes is: sqrt(d^2 + d^2) = d*sqrt(2).
The distance between opposite corners is d*sqrt(3). The space diagonal passes through centers of holes.
Distance between two opposite centers of the hemispheres (along a diagonal of the cube) is 2 - 2r, where r is the radius. The length of the space diagonal is 2, and the distance between two adjacent hemisphere centers is d. So, we have d*sqrt(3) = sqrt(d^2 + d^2 + d^2).  d * sqrt(2) = 2, from above, d = sqrt(2).
The length of the cube is 2.
Therefore, since the diameter d = sqrt(2).
