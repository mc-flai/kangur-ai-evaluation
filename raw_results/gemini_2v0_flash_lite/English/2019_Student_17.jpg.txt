Reasoning: Maria wins on her first turn if Johann draws a chocolate ball and then she draws the boiled sweet. The probability of this is (4/5) * (1/4) = 1/5. Maria also wins on her second turn if both players draw chocolate balls on their first two turns, and Maria draws the sweet. The probability of this is (4/5)*(3/4)*(1/3)= 1/5. Continuing this logic, the probability of Maria winning is the sum of the probabilities of her winning on her first, third, fifth draws and so on: 1/5 + 1/5 = 2/5.
