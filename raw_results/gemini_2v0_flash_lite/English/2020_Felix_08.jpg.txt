Reasoning: The question states the drawing has fewer squares than triangles. We need to count the squares and triangles in each option.

*   **A:** 2 squares, 2 triangles. Not valid.
*   **B:** 2 squares, 3 triangles. Valid.
*   **C:** 1 square, 3 triangles. Valid.
*   **D:** 1 square, 3 triangles. Valid.
*   **E:** 2 squares, 4 triangles. Valid.

The question asks for *what could be* her drawing, so only one of these can be the correct option. Options B, C, D and E are all valid. However, the prompt gives us the condition to evaluate and provides the answer choices. It also seems unlikely that multiple answers would be correct. With this in mind we would look for a choice that works.

Answer: B)
