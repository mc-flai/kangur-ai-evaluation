Reasoning: The question asks for the total perimeter of the park.  The numbers within each section represent that section's perimeter.  To find the total perimeter, we sum the perimeters of all the sections: 12 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 66, but this is wrong because the inside lines do not count. The correct perimeter is 12 + 3 + 11 + 9 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 4 + 10 = 66, and 66 is not a possible choice. It appears that we are only supposed to sum the numbers at the outside edges. The outer edges sum up to 12 + 9 + 11 = 32. Since we have to find all of the outside edges, let's find the outside edges of each one: 3 + 4 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 10 = 34, which is not a choice.

Since the question asks about the entire park, and not how much each part will be, we are supposed to add up the perimeter of each segment. The perimeters are: 12, 3, 4, 7, 6, 4, 9, 10, 11. 12 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 66. This is not one of the answer choices, so let's re-read the prompt. The prompt says that the diagram shows the perimeter, so we have to pick the outer edges of each shape. 12 + 3 + 11 + 9 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 4 + 10 = 66 which is still not an option.
The wording says, "How big is the perimeter of the entire park in km?". Let's assume the inside lines don't count. That's not what "the number in each section states its perimeter in km" means. We want to add up the outer perimeters only. 12 + 3 + 11 + 9 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 10 = 66.
Maybe the instructions mean we should find the perimeter of the outside.

Looking at the numbers around the outside, we see 12, 11, 9, 4, 4, 6, 7. These form an outer perimeter of 12+11+9+4+4+6+7 = 53. But that is wrong.

Let us just add up the numbers to the left, right, top, and bottom:
12 + 9 + 11
4+4+7+6+3+10 = 34. This isn't right.

12 + 9 + 11 = 32
