Reasoning: To maximize Anna's chance of winning, she wants to minimize the number of white balls Beate can draw. The options are:
*   **A:** 1 white and 1 black ball in each box. The probability of Beate drawing a white ball is equal in all boxes.
*   **B:** Three boxes with black balls only, and two with white. The probability of drawing a white ball is higher than other.
*   **C:** Four boxes with only black balls, one with all five white balls. Beate would take a white ball with high probability.
*   **D:** One box with 5 white balls, and the remaining four with one black ball each. Beate has a good chance of getting a white ball.
*   **E:** One box with 5 black balls, and the remaining four with one white ball each. This minimizes the chance of Beate drawing a white ball since Beate would draw a white ball only if it chooses any of the four boxes with one white ball.

The best strategy is to isolate as many black balls as possible to make the number of white balls smaller in most boxes. Option E does this by putting the black balls in one box and distributing one white ball in each of the four other boxes.
Answer: E)
