Reasoning:
1.  **Analyze the views:** The "von oben" view shows a 4x3 grid, with a missing cube in the lower right corner. The "von vorne" view shows a 3x3 block with a missing cube in the lower right corner. The "von rechts" view shows a 3x3 block.
2.  **Combine the views:** By combining the information, we can infer the following cube arrangement.
    *   The top row is a 4 cube row.
    *   The second row: 3 cubes.
    *   The third row: 1 cube.
    *   Thus, there can be at most: 4+3+3+3+3+2 = 18 cubes.
3.  **Consider all possibilities:** The maximum possible cubes is achieved when the stacks in the von vorne and von rechts views correspond to the heights observed in the von oben view.
4.   **Count the cubes**: Adding up the cubes in the layout, we count 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 18 cubes.
