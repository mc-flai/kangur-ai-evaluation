Reasoning:
The expression can be simplified as follows:
(1/9) * 10^2018 * (10^2018 - 1) = (1/9) * 10^2018 * (999...9)  (2018 nines)
= (1/9) * (999...9000...0)   (2018 nines, 2018 zeros)
= 111...1000...0  (2018 ones, 2018-1 = 2017 zeros). This division results in the alternating pattern of 1s.
= 111...1 (2018 ones) * 10^2017
The number will have 2018 ones followed by 2017 zeros
The result of (1/9)*(10^2018 - 1) is a number with 2018 digits all of which are 1.
When this result is multiplied by 10^2018, the digits of the result will be 2018 ones followed by 2018 zeros.
Then, divide the above result by 9.
(1/9)* 10^2018 * (10^2018-1) simplifies to 11...1 * 10^2017
So the calculation involves a string of 2018 ones followed by 2017 zeros.
This number has 2018+2017 = 4035 digits.
