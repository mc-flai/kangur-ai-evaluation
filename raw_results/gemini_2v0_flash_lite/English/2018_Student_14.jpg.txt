Reasoning: The octahedron is inscribed in a cube of side 1. The vertices of the octahedron are the midpoints of the faces. The octahedron can be seen as two square pyramids joined at their bases. The base of each pyramid is a square with side length equal to the diagonal of a face of the cube. Since the face of the cube has side length 1, the diagonal has length sqrt(2)/2. Thus, the area of the base of each pyramid is (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = 1/2. The height of each pyramid is 1/2 (half the side length of the cube). The volume of one pyramid is (1/3) * base area * height = (1/3) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/12. The volume of the octahedron is twice this value = 2 * (1/12) = 1/6.
