Reasoning: The question states the product of six consecutive numbers is a 12-digit number in the specific format "abb cdd cdd abb", and that the digits a, b, c, and d are consecutive. This means that the product has the form: x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)(x+5). Also, we have to deduce the product where the middle digits repeats.

The consecutive digits must be the repeating ones.  The 12 digit number can also be represented as:
1,2,3,4. This means that a, b, c, d are 1, 2, 3, 4.
Let's analyze the possible values of d. d is the digit in the position cdd cdd.
So the values of the digits are 3, 4 and therefore the value for d is 3 or 4.
If d is 3, then the product would be of the form ab3 c33 ab. This means that consecutive numbers will have the form, and this is not compatible with the previous analysis. 
If d is 4, then the product will have the form ab4 c44 ab. Based on consecutive digits, we can deduce that d is the digit 4.
If a,b,c,d are consecutive, a likely value is 3,4,5,6. This suggests d could be 4 or 5.  However, if d=4, then the form is ab4 c44 ab.  If d=5, then it is abb c55 c55 abb.

The product of 6 consecutive numbers:
1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 = 720 (not 12 digits and does not satisfy consecutive numbers)
5*6*7*8*9*10 = 151200 (6 digits)
13 * 14 * 15 * 16 * 17 * 18 = 135721920 (9 digits)

If d = 4, then the form is *164**44**16. Let's test 13*14*15*16*17*18 = 135721920.
Trying different combinations of consecutive numbers.
Let's see if 5*6*7*8*9*10, the d digits are 0.  (7 digits)
11*12*13*14*15*16 = 57657600 (8 digits)
12*13*14*15*16*17 = 89197920 (8 digits)
Let the consecutive digits be 3,4,5,6
So the form is *33*4*4*33.
If we assume a product that fits our condition: the answer is d=4.
