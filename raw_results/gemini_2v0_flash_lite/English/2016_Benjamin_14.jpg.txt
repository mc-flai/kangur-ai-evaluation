Reasoning: We want to minimize the sum of the three numbers. To do this, we should try to keep the individual numbers relatively small. Consider placing the cuts strategically to achieve this. Let's look at possible placements:
1. Cut 1: 2, Cut 2: 5. Then, we have 2 + 581953764 = 581953766.  Too big.
2. Cut 1: 25, Cut 2: 8.  25 + 81953764 = 81953789. Too big.
3. Cut 1: 258, Cut 2: 1. 258 + 1953764 = 1954022. Too big.
4. Cut 1: 2581, Cut 2: 9. 2581 + 953764 = 956345. Too big.
5. Cut 1: 25819, Cut 2: 5. 25819 + 53764 = 79583. Too big.
6. Cut 1: 258195, Cut 2: 3. 258195 + 3764 = 261959. Too big.
7. Cut 1: 258, Cut 2: 195. The numbers would be 258, 195, and 3764. Sum = 258 + 195 + 3764 = 4217
8. Cut 1: 2, Cut 2: 581953764. This gives us only two numbers not three, so that does not count.
9. Let us try 25, 8, 1953764. The sum is 1953797. This is not a small sum.
10. Let us try 258, 1, 953764. The sum is 954123. Not very small.
11. Let us try 2581, 9, 53764. The sum is 53764+2581+9 = 53764 + 2590= 56354.
12.  Let's try cuts after the 8 and the 3: 258 + 195 + 3764 = 4217.
13.  Let's try 25 + 81953 + 764 = 82742.
14. Let's try after 5 and after 3: 25819+ 5 + 3764 = 29588. Not smallest.
15. Try cutting after the 9 and after the 3: 258195 + 3 + 764 = 258962
16.  Let's cut between 8 & 1, and 5 & 3 => 258, 195, 3764. Sum = 4217.
Try cutting between 5 and 3 and then between 1 and 9: 2581+9+53764 = 56354.
17. Now let's try cutting 5 and 3 => 25819 + 5 + 3764 = 29588
Consider 25+ 8+1953764 is a large number.
So, after considering a few examples, 258 + 195 + 3764 = 4217 seems like the smallest.
