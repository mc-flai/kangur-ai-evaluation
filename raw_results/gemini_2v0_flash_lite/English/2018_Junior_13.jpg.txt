Reasoning:
The square has a side length of 4, therefore its area is 4*4 = 16. Each semi-circle has a diameter of 1. The radius is therefore 1/2. There are 8 semi-circles making a total of 4 circles.
The area of each circle is:  πr^2 = π(1/2)^2 = π/4
The total area of the 4 circles is 4 * (π/4) = π.
The white area can be found subtracting the grey area (the circles) from the total area of the square, the white area is = 16-π. However, this solution is not in the given options, and the given white area seems wrong.
Let's consider another option to estimate the white area, the white area is the area of square excluding the 8 semi-circles.
The semi-circles are congruent, and the side length is 4.
Let's look at the area of the square, the area of each semi-circle = (π * (4/2/2)^2)/2 = π/2
Total grey area = 8*(π/2) = 4π
Area of square is 4*4 = 16
The white area is (16-4π)
However, the image appears to show an area that is much smaller than 16 - 4π. Let's try to analyze the image.
The side length of the square is 4. The diameter of each semi-circle is 1.
The diagram has 4 grey shapes that form a "pinwheel" pattern. The total area occupied by the shapes is the sum of 4 such shapes.
Each small square has size 1*1, the area of each semi-circle is π(0.5)^2/2 = π/8, the area of the part in each corner is 1-π/4.
Each shape in grey is formed by 2 semi circles, so this is a single circle.
The radius of each semi circle = diameter/2 = side/4 = 4/4 = 1/2
The area of a semi circle = π r^2 / 2 = π (1/2)^2/2 = π/8
There are 8 semi circles, and each has area π/8, this is = π
The area of the grey area is 4*(1 - (π/4)) = 4 - π
Therefore, the area of the white part = 16 - 4 + π = 8.
The white area = Area of the square - area of semi-circles (grey area). 8 semi-circles are there.
Each semi-circle covers an area of (pi * (4/4)^2)/2 = pi/2
Total area covered by circles = 8 * (pi/8) = π * radius ^ 2
The grey area can be calculated by the number of circles as 4 semi circles * 2.
The total area is 8 * (π/8)
The total area of the grey region can be found by: 4 * ( area of the square - area of the circle)
The area of one circle is π/4
The square's area = 16
The semi circle diameters = 1. Radius = 1/2
Area of each semi circle = 1/2 * pi * (1/2)^2 = pi/8
Total grey area = 8* (π/8) = π
White area = 16 - area of grey parts, or 16 - π
This doesn't match any of the options. Let's examine the grey area:
The small square is of size 1 x 1.  The area is 1.
In each grey "petal", two semi-circles are cut out from the square.  The corners are formed by two semicircles. Each small square has 2 such semicircles, which create an area of a circle. The square will have a radius =1/2. Hence the area of one square is 1.
The grey shape comprises a total area of pi. The sides are straight 2.  The grey parts will cover each side. The semi-circles have radius of 1/2
4 small squares are there with a total area = 4.
The white area in each corner  is (1 - π/4). 4 such regions are present
So, white area  is 4*(1- pi/4)  The white area is: square area - grey area = 4 * ( area of the square - area of the semicircle)
Total area of the square = 4 * 4= 16
The grey area appears to be formed by two quarter-circles. It forms the corner area of the semi-circles. This appears like 4 squares.
The radius of a semi-circle  is 4/4= 1/2
so the area of the quarter-circles = π * (1/2)^2 / 4
Total area = pi
The white area inside the square, excluding the circle, area is 8.
White area = 8.
