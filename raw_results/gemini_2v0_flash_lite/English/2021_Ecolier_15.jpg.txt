Reasoning: The problem provides the heights of three ladders: 32, 36 and 48. We need to find the height of the shortest ladder among the four.
Let the four heights be A, B, 32, 36, and 48. The shortest is unknown and it is among the provided options. Since all the values are provided on the building image, we can assume the unknown value should be between these three ladder heights. Also the answer should be less than 32, otherwise the ladder is not the shortest. Among the given options, only A) 12, B) 14, and C) 16 are less than 32.

Answer: A)
