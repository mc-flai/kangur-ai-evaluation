Reasoning:
1.  The grey area is 45% of the total area.
2.  The white area of the triangle is 40% of the total area.
3.  Therefore, the area of the circle not inside the triangle is 100% - 45% - 40% = 15% of the total shape.
4.  The circle has a section that is grey and inside the triangle and a section that is white and outside the triangle.
5.  The white area of the shape is 40%, and the white area of the shape is the area of the triangle plus the white part of the circle.
6.  The white part of the triangle is 40%.
7.  The white area of the circle is therefore 15% of the total area.
8.  The total grey area is 45% of the total shape.
9.  The total area of the shape equals 100%.
10. The white portion of the circle is 15% of the total shape, and the total grey area is 45%, implying the grey area of the circle represents the overlap, that is, 45%.
11. We know that 15% represents the white portion of the circle. The grey portion of the circle is the remainder, so we have 100% of the circle is 15% of the entire shape's area plus 45% from the overlapped grey section = 60%.
12. Therefore, the ratio of white circle area to total circle is 15/60 = 1/4 = 25%.
