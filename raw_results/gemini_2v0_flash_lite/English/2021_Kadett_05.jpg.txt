Reasoning: The puzzle pieces show a calculation: 202 - 1 = 201. There's a missing piece. Considering the other options, the calculation is likely 202 - 1 = 201, then the final puzzle piece is probably a plus sign. The only way to make it into an option is if we assume the operation is meant to be 202 + 1 - the missing piece is an addition operator. Then we can solve the expression 202 + 1 = 203. The only way to reach an answer option from this would be subtracting some amount from 203. Looking at options for the missing piece. The missing piece would have to be a subtraction operator for us to do the math to solve the problem: 202 + (missing piece) = X.

The problem likely intends that the expression is 202 + 1 = 203 and the "missing piece" has the answer.

The calculation is likely 202 + 1 = 203. But 203 is not an option. The calculation is meant to be: 202 + 1, and the question asks "what is the answer to *this calculation*?".

Answer: D)
