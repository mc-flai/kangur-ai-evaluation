Reasoning: Let's count the squares on each tray:
A: 2 squares. Three-quarters would be 1.5, which is not possible.
B: 9 squares. Three-quarters would be 6.75, which is not possible.
C: 12 squares. Three-quarters would be 9.  This tray seems to correctly painted 9 out of the 12 squares
D: 8 squares. Three-quarters would be 6.  This tray seems to correctly painted 6 out of the 8 squares.
E: 12 squares. Three-quarters would be 9.  This tray seems to correctly painted 9 out of the 12 squares.

The total amount of painted squares in A is not an integer number of squares.
The total amount of painted squares in B is not an integer number of squares.
Thus, the only one of the trays that had a wrong amount of painted squares is B.

Answer: B)
