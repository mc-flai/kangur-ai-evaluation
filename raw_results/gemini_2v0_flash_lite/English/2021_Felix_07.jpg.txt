Reasoning:
1. Identify children facing forwards: From the image, identify those who are facing the viewer, which is from the first child (the one in the front) to the seventh child from the left.
2. Identify children using their right hand: Now, look for the children holding another child's hand with their right hand. For each of these, check the right hand is holding someone else's hand.
3. Count: Count how many children fit the above condition.

Here's how it breaks down:
*   Child 1: Right hand holds child 2's hand.
*   Child 2: The child in front is holding their hand.
*   Child 3: Right hand holds child 4's hand.
*   Child 4: The child in front is holding their hand.
*   Child 5: Right hand holds child 6's hand.
*   Child 6: The child in front is holding their hand.
*   Child 7: Right hand is holding child 8's hand.
*   Child 8: The child in front is holding their hand.

Therefore, there are 6 children holding hands with their right hand.
