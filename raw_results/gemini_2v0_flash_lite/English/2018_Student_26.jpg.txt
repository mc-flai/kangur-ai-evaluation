Reasoning:
The problem describes a billiard ball trajectory. We can use similar triangles to solve this problem. The billiard table has sides of length 3m and 2m. BM is 1.2m so AM is 3m - 1.2m = 1.8m.  BN is 0.8m, so the other side is 2m - 0.8m = 1.2m. We want to find the distance from A to the point where the ball hits the side again. Because the reflections follow the law of reflection (angle of incidence equals angle of reflection) the path unwinds to a straight line, which simplifies the geometry to similar triangles. The similar triangles formed by the path of the ball will use the known lengths to deduce the unknown value. The height of the rectangle is 2m and BN=0.8, hence the height from where the ball hit is 0.8m. From the distance MB=1.2, then AB=3 and AM=1.8m.

Let x be the distance from A where the ball hits the side again. By similar triangles, the ratio of the sides must be equivalent. Hence, AM/x = height of rectangle/BN which leads to 1.8/x = 2/(0.8+0.8) which means 1.8/x = 2/1.6 or x = (1.8*1.6)/2 = 1.44.

The question wants to determine how far from A, the ball hits the side again.

We have a triangle with sides 3 and 2. The value BN = 0.8 m and BM = 1.2 m, then AM = 3 - 1.2 = 1.8 m. Using similar triangles,

AM / x = 2 / (2-0.8+0.8)
1.  8 / x = 2 / 1.6
x = 1.8 * 1.6 / 2
x = 2.88/2
x = 1.44 m

Considering the similar triangles with height of 2, the ball strikes at 0.8 from the top, so the bottom has length 1.2+1.2 = 2.4.

We have AM = 1.8. If x is the distance from A where the ball strikes again,
1.  8/x = 2/2.4, or x/1.8 = 2.4/2, thus x = 1.8 * 2.4 / 2 = 2.16 m
With vertical side is 2m, and BN = 0.8 m
the next point must be at 0.8 m above. So we can create a triangle 1.2+1.2=2.4 m from the B, we need x where 1.8/x=2/2.4 or x = 1.8*2.4/2 = 2.16

Since the length of side AB = 3m, from AM = 1.8 m, then the next point where ball hits the side should be at 1.2 m + 1.2 m which is from B, the next point where it hits will be distance 2.4 m.

x/1.8 = 2/2.4
x/1.8 = 5/6
x = 1.8*5/6
x=1.5
