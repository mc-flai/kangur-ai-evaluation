Reasoning:
1. Analyze the grid: The first row has a circle, a star, and a heart and sums to 15. The second row has three circles and sums to 12. The third row has a star and two hearts and sums to 16.
2. Find the value of a circle: Since three circles sum to 12, each circle must be 12 / 3 = 4.
3. Find the value of a heart: The first row is (circle) + (star) + (heart) = 15. The second row gives the circle value which is 4, so we know the value of the heart from the third row: (star) + 2 * (heart) = 16. Replacing the circle in the first row, we have: 4 + (star) + (heart) = 15. So (star) + (heart) = 11.  Now we need to find the heart value: let's use row 3: (star) + 2(heart) = 16 and rearrange to be (heart) = (16 - star)/2. Now, since we also know (star) + (heart) = 11, we substitute heart: star + (16 - star)/2 = 11. Multiplying all by 2, gives: 2*star + 16 - star = 22, so star + 16 = 22, and therefore, star = 6.
4. Check the solution: If star is 6, then heart is (16-6)/2 = 5. Row 1: 4+6+5 = 15. Row 2: 4+4+4 = 12. Row 3: 6+5+5 = 16.
