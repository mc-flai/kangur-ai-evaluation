Reasoning: The problem states that the first two digits must be equal to the last two digits. The first two digits can be any number from 1 to 99. Thus, we have 9 choices for the first digit (1-9), and 10 choices for the second (0-9). Thus, there are 9 * 10 = 90 such numbers. However, we must also count the number 0000 through 0099, and since 00 is identical to 0 we must include 0-99. Since 00 is the same as 0, but we cannot have a single digit, we will use 00-99. Then there are 100 possibilities in total, namely the numbers: 0000, 0101, 0202,..., 9999. However, we need to exclude those that start with zero. Thus the first two digits must range from 1 to 99.  Since any number can be represented by two digits from 00 to 99 inclusive, including 0000, there are 100 such numbers. However, a two-digit number from 0 to 9 is still two digits, namely 00, 01, ..., 09. Then we must include 2020. Therefore there are 90 such numbers, including 2020.
