Reasoning:
1. Analyze the given information: We know the weights of the five balls are 30g, 50g, 50g, 50g, and 80g. We need to determine which of the balls A, B, C, D, or E weighs 30g.
2. Examine the balance scales:
   - Scale 1: C and D are on the heavier side.
   - Scale 2: E and B are on the heavier side.
   - Scale 3: A and D are on the heavier side.
   - Scale 4: A and B are on the heavier side.
   - Scale 5: A and C are on the heavier side.
   - Scale 6: E, C, and B are on the heavier side.
3. Deduce weights from the scales: Since the weights must sum to 260g and we have three 50g balls.
4. Since E and B are on the heavier side in the second scale, and A and D are on the heavier side in the fourth and fifth scales.
5. From scale 1 we know that C+D must have one 30g or one 80g ball; from the fourth scale, A + B can not contain either the 30g or the 80g ball, and the third scale must contain the 80g ball,
6. Deduce the correct order of the weights. Scale 3 is 50g + 80g vs A and D.
   - We can deduce that ball D weighs 80g, ball C weighs 50g, ball A weighs 50g and ball B must be 50g and thus, ball E is 30g.

Answer: E
