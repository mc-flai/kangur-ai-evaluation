Reasoning: The paper is folded multiple times. The hole is punched in the final folded state. When unfolded, the hole will be duplicated depending on the folds. The hole appears on only one layer of the paper in the final folded state. The folding process creates a layered structure with different layers. From the last figure, we see that the paper has a circular hole punched in the top part of the green side. When the paper is unfolded it unfolds to show the original rectangular shape. The circular hole is reflected across the folds. Based on the folds we can figure out the numbers of layers there are and hence the number of holes in the unfolded state. The image has the following folds: 1) a fold along the center line, which would cause two holes. 2) folds on both sides that make up the green triangular part, which would cause another two holes. 3) another fold along the vertical centerline makes a total of 4 folds and each fold will cause the number of holes to duplicate. Since there is one hole shown in the final image, and from the folds, we will have 4 holes.

Answer: (B)
