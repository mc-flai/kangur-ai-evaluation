Reasoning:
1.  **Triangle ABC:** Since triangle ABC is isosceles and angle ABC is 40 degrees, the other two angles (BAC and BCA) are equal.
2.  **Angles BAC and BCA:** The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, 180 - 40 = 140 degrees. Since angles BAC and BCA are equal, each is 140 / 2 = 70 degrees.
3.  **Angles EAB and DCA:** The problem states that angles EAB and DCA are equal. Since angle BAC = 70 degrees, angle EAB is part of this and angle DCA is the equal value of the part from angle BCA. This means each of EAB and DCA are less than the complete angle BAC or BCA, but we don't need to know their values to find the answer.
4.  **Angle CFE:**  Angle CFE is an exterior angle to triangle AFD (or EFA). The exterior angle theorem states that an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. The two interior angles that add up to CFE are angle EAB and angle BCA. Angle EAB is equal to angle DCA. The sum of angles EAB + DCA is 70 degrees.
5.  **Angle CFE Calculation** The angle CFE is inside the triangle, so we will focus on the adjacent exterior angle. The exterior angle is an adjacent supplementary angle to CFE, which must be CFE. The value will be equal to CFE. The value of CFE will be the sum of EAB + BCA, so we can conclude that CFE must be (70-x) + (70) = 140 - x. We do not know the value of x, but we know the value of the external angle and adjacent supplementary, this external angle will be 70.  We can find the value of CFE using the formula, CFE = 180-70 = 110. This doesn't match the values.
    We could also notice that triangle AFE is similar to triangle ABC, which would have the same angles, then solve. This makes me think that CFE is just 70.
