Reasoning: Let's denote the time between sending the first and second messenger as T=1 hour. The king moves away from the castle at 5 km/h. The first messenger travels towards the castle at 10 km/h. Let the distance covered by the king in 1 hour be D = 5 km. Let the time taken by the messenger to reach the castle be t. The distance is D + 5*t = 10*t. Then, 5*t=D, then t= D/5= 1 hour. The second messenger is sent after 1 hour. When the second messenger is sent, the king is at the distance of 5*2 = 10 km. And the first messenger must have reached the castle 1 hour after sending. So, at the time that the second messenger starts moving, the king is at distance of 10 km. The second messenger reaches the castle in a time t2 with distance =  5*2 + 5*t2 = 10*t2, this means 10=5*t2, so t2 = 2 hours. So, the second messenger arrives 2 hours after sending. So the difference is 2 - 1 = 1 hour = 60 minutes.
