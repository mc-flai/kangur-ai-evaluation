Reasoning: There are 14 girls and 12 boys, for a total of 26 children. Half of the group goes for a walk, so 26 / 2 = 13 children go for a walk. To find the *minimum* number of girls, we assume as many boys as possible go for the walk first. Since there are 12 boys, all 12 boys could go for the walk. This means there's 13 - 12 = 1 spot left, which must be taken by a girl. Therefore, at least 1 girl must be among the group that goes for a walk.
