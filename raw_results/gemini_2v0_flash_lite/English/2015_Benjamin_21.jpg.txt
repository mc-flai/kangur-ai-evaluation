Reasoning:
1.  Analyze the given net: The net has 7 squares. A cube requires 6 squares.
2.  Evaluate the removal of squares: Removing squares should result in a connected net. Also, the remaining 6 squares must be able to form a valid cube net.
3.  Removing square 4 will still leave a valid cube net.
4.  Removing square 7 will still leave a valid cube net.
5.  Removing square 3 will still leave a valid cube net.
6.  Any single combination of 3,4 or 7 can form the cube.

Answer: E)
