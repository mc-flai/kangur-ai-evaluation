Reasoning: The problem asks for the minimum number of power plants needed. The diagram is a graph representing towns and roads.  Each power plant covers itself and its immediate neighbors.  We need to cover all 16 towns.  I will visually analyze the graph and look for central points where a power plant can cover multiple other towns. I start by identifying towns that, if chosen for a power plant, will cover several towns. In this grid-like structure, a good placement of power plants would be near the center of the structure to cover a large number of towns. If we place power plants in four places, for example: one in the top-left, one in the top-right, one in the bottom-left, and one in the bottom-right, we can then place a fifth power plant in the center.
Answer: C) 5
