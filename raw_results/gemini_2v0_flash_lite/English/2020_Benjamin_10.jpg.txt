Reasoning:
1. **Determine the distances:** Count the number of squares the dark mouse travels: 6 squares. Count the number of squares the white mouse travels: 3 squares.
2. **Establish the ratio:** The distance the white mouse travels is 3/6 = 1/2 the distance the dark mouse travels.
3. **Calculate the white mouse's speed:** Since they arrive at the same time, the speeds are proportional to the distances. If the dark mouse runs 4.5 meters/second, then the white mouse runs at half that speed. 4.5 / 2 = 2.25. The closest option is (D).

Answer: D)
