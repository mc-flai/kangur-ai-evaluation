Reasoning: The original cube has 3x3x3 = 27 small cubes. The diagram shows the cube viewed from three directions. From the right, front and above, we observe that there are 6 visible cubes, with 3 in the front and 3 behind it. However, it is a 3x3 cube and should have at least 9 cubes on each side. The second layer is missing 1 cube, and the third one is missing 2 cubes, which makes a total of 1 + 2 = 3 cubes missing. The cube visible in the question shows that one cube is missing on the top layer and 2 cubes are missing on the bottom layer. The front view of the cube shows that the middle column is missing 1 and 2 cubes. Adding this up, there are 1 (top right) + 2(bottom right) + 1 (middle top) + 2(middle bottom) = 6 missing cubes.

Answer: D)
