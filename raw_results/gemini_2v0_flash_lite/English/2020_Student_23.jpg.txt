Reasoning: The whole set is a 60x60 square, making its area 3600 m². The garden is 50m long and 40m wide, so its area is 2000m². Since the fence divides the whole area into two equal parts of 1800 m², and the garden is 2000 m², the fence must pass through the garden and the lake. Let's say that the fence starts at a side of the square, and ends at the opposite side of the square. We have to find the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the fence and the sides of the square. The fence passes through the bottom side of the rectangle (50m) so it's x distance from the corner of the square, then it crosses the square and joins the other side with the lake. The length of the square is 60 m. The area of the garden and a portion of the lake is 1800 m². The height of the garden is 40m. The whole set's area is 3600 m². Then, the area of the garden and the lake is half of the square area, so it is 1800 m². The area of the garden is 50m x 40m = 2000 m².
The lake area is 60x60 - 2000 = 1600 m².
The fence splits the whole area into two equal parts. The whole square is 60x60=3600. Then we have two areas of 1800. Let's suppose the lake side is x. Then the area of the lake can be found to be (60-x) * 60 = 1600 m²
Since we know the whole area of the square is 3600, the split can go at a distance of x.
Let x be the distance from the left side of the top side where the fence starts. The right end of the fence has a length of 40m. The fence is a straight line.
Then the area of the garden and some of the lake is 1800.
The garden area is 2000m², so we need to find the area of the lake to be 1800.
Let's set up the coordinates. One side of the square is 60. One rectangle side is 50, another is 40.
The area of the garden is 2000. The area of the lake is 1600. The total area is 3600. The area of the fence is 1800.
The height of the lake is 60-40 = 20m.
The length of the fence is x. x^2 = 30^2 + (30*2)^2 = 30^2 + 60^2.
The fence equation is of the form y = mx + c
Where y is 0 when x is a. And when y is 60, x is b.
Area of the garden is 2000. Half is 1000, 1800
The x distance is 30, 30. Length of the fence is sqrt(30^2+60^2) = 30*sqrt(5)
Then, length is sqrt(60^2+30^2) = sqrt(3600+900) = sqrt(4500) = 30√5
