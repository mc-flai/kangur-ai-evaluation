Reasoning: The problem asks for the next year after 2016 where the sum of the digits equals 9. We need to test each option provided.
- 2007: 2 + 0 + 0 + 7 = 9. However, this is before 2016, so it is not valid.
- 2025: 2 + 0 + 2 + 5 = 9.
- 2034: 2 + 0 + 3 + 4 = 9
- 2108: 2 + 1 + 0 + 8 = 11.
- 2134: 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 10.

Since the question asked the next year after 2016, and 2025 is the first year after that, we can just check this option.
2+0+2+5 = 9, and 2025 is before 2034, so we choose that answer.

Answer: B)
