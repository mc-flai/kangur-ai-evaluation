Reasoning:
Let's assume the iceberg is a cube with side 's'. The total volume is s^3. The submerged volume is 96.4% of the total volume, so the portion above water is 3.6% of the total volume.
Let x be the height of the iceberg above the water. Then, x/s = 0.036^(1/3). Then x = 0.036^(1/3) * s. The area of the iceberg above the water is then s^2.
The surface area of the part in contact with the air can be calculated in relation to the total surface area of the cube:
The total surface area is 6s^2
Surface area above water:  (s^2) + 4(x*s) = s^2 + 4(0.036^(1/3) * s * s) = s^2 + 4*0.33*s^2 = 2.32 s^2.
Percentage = 2.32s^2 / 6s^2 = 0.39= 39%
That looks incorrect.

Let's calculate the portion of the side not submerged and the top:
Above surface percentage is 1 - 0.964 = 0.036
Let s be the length of each side. Total surface area is 6s^2
If 0.964 submerged, that means the submerged height is 0.964 * s. The remaining height is 0.036 * s.
Surface area exposed to air = 1 * s^2 (top) + 4 * (s * 0.036^(1/3) * s) = s^2 + 0.036^(1/3) * 4s^2.  There is an error here.
If the side is "s" and the part above water is "x", then x^3 / s^3 = 1 - 0.964 = 0.036.
So x = s * 0.036^(1/3) = s * 0.33.
The top surface area is s^2
The side area is 4 * x * s = 4 * 0.33s * s = 1.32 s^2.
Total area is 2.32 s^2.
Total Surface Area of the cube is 6s^2
Percentage = 2.32 / 6 = 0.386 or ~38.6%
However, the assumption in this calculation is incorrect. The submerged volume corresponds to 96.4% of the total volume, so we can't just take the height above the water.
Let 's' be the side of the cube.
Submerged depth is 'd'.
Then submerged volume is s^2 * d = 0.964 s^3
Therefore, d = 0.964 s.
The height above water is s - d = s - 0.964s = 0.036s.
The area exposed to air:
Top: s^2
Sides: 4 * s * (s - d) = 4 * s * 0.036s = 0.144s^2
Total surface area = s^2 + 4 * 0.036s^2= (1 + 0.144)s^2.
So, 4 sides are: 4 * s * (s - 0.964s) = 4 * s * 0.036s = 0.144s^2
Total surface area in contact with the air = s^2 (top) + 4 * 0.036 * s^2 = s^2 + 0.144s^2 = 1.144s^2
Total surface area of the iceberg is 6s^2.
Percentage = 1.144s^2 / (6s^2) = 0.19066666666666666, which is about 19%.
