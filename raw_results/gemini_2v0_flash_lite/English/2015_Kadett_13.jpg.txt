Reasoning: The grey area can be broken down into two shapes. First, there is a triangle on top with base 1 and height 0.5, which results in an area of (1 * 0.5)/2 = 0.25. Second, there is also a triangle on the right side with base 1 and height 0.5, which results in an area of (1 * 0.5)/2 = 0.25. This can be expressed as 1/4. Adding those two areas together results in 1/4 + 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2.

Answer: E)
