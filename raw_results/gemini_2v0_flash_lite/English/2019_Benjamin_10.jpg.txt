Reasoning: The six smallest odd natural numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.  Toni rolls the die three times and adds the numbers.
*   **Minimum Sum:** 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. (A) is possible.
*   **Maximum Sum:** 11 + 11 + 11 = 33.
*   **Trying to make 19:** Since the die has odd numbers only, the sum of any three numbers rolled must also be odd. 19 is odd so is possible. One way to make 19 is 11+5+3=19. (B) is possible.
*   **Trying to make 21:** 7+7+7 = 21. (C) is possible.
*   **Trying to make 29:** 11+9+9=29. (D) is possible.
*   **Trying to make 35:** This would be possible with three rolls of 11, 11+11+13, however, 13 is not a possible roll.
*   Sums between 3 and 33 are possible since we can have 1,3,5,7,9 and 11. The sum of 35 is not possible.
