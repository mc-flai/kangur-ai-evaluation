Reasoning:
Let N be the number of noblemen and L be the number of liars.
The total number of people is 2017, so N + L = 2017.
Each person says "Of my two neighbors, one is a liar and one is a nobleman."
If a nobleman says this, it means their neighbors are a liar and a nobleman (N L N).
If a liar says this, it means their neighbors are either both noblemen (N N) or both liars (L L).
To maximize the number of noblemen, the arrangement around the table should be as much as possible (L N L N L N...). This means that no two noblemen can be next to each other. Also, no two liars can be next to each other. Therefore, the arrangement is alternating.
If there are N noblemen, there will be N liars if N is even or N-1 or N+1 liars if N is odd. Since the island has 2017 people, we can have a maximum of 2017/3 noblemen.

Case 1: N is even. In this case, if the arrangement is L N L N L N ...., then the statement is true. But the statement is not always true. If N and L alternate, they cannot be adjacent.
So the arrangement will be (N L) or (L N).
For a nobleman, the neighbors must be L, and for a liar, neighbors must be N.
Arrangement should be L N L N L N ... (N is even) or N L N L N ... (N is odd).
Since each person claims to have one liar and one nobleman as neighbors, we must have alternating neighbors.
Let's assume there are N noblemen. Then there must be an arrangement where N is maximum. In the maximum case, the noblemen are separated by liars. So the arrangement can be:
L N L N L N .... or N L N L N L ....

So the maximum number of noblemen occurs when the arrangement is as close to L N L N L N...
If N is even, then N = 2k. So number of liars will also be 2k.
If N is odd, we arrange the pattern so that the total number of people is 2017. The configuration becomes L N L N .... L N L N or N L N L .... N L N L or N L N L ..... N L.
If the arrangement is L N L N... , the number of people can be described as N + L = 2017, so the number of noblemen can be approximately 2017/3.
N + L = 2017. Let N be the number of noblemen and L the number of liars. Then the arrangement should be L N L N .... or N L N L N ....
When there is an L N L N L N..., if there are N noblemen, there must be at most N+1 or N-1 liars.
If the arrangement is L N L N L N ..., then N can be close to 2017/3.
Then the number of noblemen can be N, and number of liars can be L. So N+ L = 2017
The configuration will be:
L N L N L N ... or N L N L N L ...
If we have N noblemen, at least N liars, at most N+1 liars. So L can be N or N+1.
If N noblemen, then N + L = 2017, and L = N or L=N+1.
Consider N and L, so we can have 2N <= 2017, then N = 1008 or 1009.
However, the statement said, "one is a liar and one is a nobleman." which is only true if we have L N L N L N. So we must have N and L as close as possible.
So the arrangement must be L N L N L ...
Let there be x groups of L N. So each group contains 2.
2x = 2017, so we can not have 2x.
If we have L N L ... and the number of people = 2017, then N = 1008 and L = 1009 (or vice versa).
So L = N, and N is the maximum number of noblemen.
If N is even, and L is odd, then there will be L = N+1 or N-1.
Since N and L cannot be adjacent, let the configuration be L N L N ... or N L N L ...
The arrangement must be L N L N ...
Then N must be close to 2/3 * 2017 ~ 1344
Then the maximum number of noblemen must be 1344.
If we have 1344 N. Then the remaining must be 673.
So we will have 1344 noblemen, and 673 liars.
