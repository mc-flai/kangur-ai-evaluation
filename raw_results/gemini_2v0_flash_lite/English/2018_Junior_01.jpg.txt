Reasoning: To satisfy the condition "every child in my family has at least two brothers and at least one sister", there must be at least 3 boys and at least 2 girls.  Consider the boys: each boy must have 2 brothers.  Thus, there must be at least 3 boys.  Also, there must be at least 1 sister. The girls must also have at least 2 brothers.  So we need at least 2 girls. Therefore, the minimum number of children is 3 (boys) + 2 (girls) = 5.
