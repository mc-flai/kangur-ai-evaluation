Reasoning: The question asks which cards from the left were *not* used to build the tower on the right. By comparing the two images we can see that the tower uses: 3 blue circles, 4 green squares, and 3 red triangles. Comparing this to the original image, we can see that the tower did not use all the cards in the left image. The cards that are not used are a red triangle, a green square, and a blue circle. This matches option (A).

Answer: A)
