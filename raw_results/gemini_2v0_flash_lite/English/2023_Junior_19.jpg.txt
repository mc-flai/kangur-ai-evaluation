Reasoning:
1.  **Calculate the area of the large square:** The side length is 30 cm, so the area is 30 * 30 = 900 cm².
2.  **Calculate the area of each small square:** The large square is split into 9 equal squares, so the area of each small square is 900 / 9 = 100 cm².
3.  **Identify the shaded squares and calculate their combined area:** There are five fully shaded small squares with an area of 5 * 100 = 500 cm².
4.  **Calculate the area of the circles:** The bottom right circle has a radius of 5 cm, so its area is π * 5² = 25π cm². The top left circle has a radius of 4 cm, so its area is π * 4² = 16π cm². The top right circle has a radius of 3 cm, so its area is π * 3² = 9π cm².
5.  **Calculate the area of the circles that are NOT shaded:** The bottom right circle is not fully shaded, but the bottom right circle area is not important as it's not the answer of the question. The top left circle and the top right circles are partially in unshaded regions.
6.  **Calculate the total shaded area:** The shaded area is the area of the five fully shaded squares, which is 500 cm².
