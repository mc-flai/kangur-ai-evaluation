Reasoning: The measuring tape is wound around the cylinder in a continuous spiral. Each full revolution adds the same amount. We can see that 1 is followed by 32, so each level adds 31. The level below the question mark ends with 31, so the next level must be 31 + 31 = 62. However, the numbers on that level start with the number 22, so the number we are looking for can be obtained by subtracting the difference between the number 1 and 22, that is 21, from 62: 62 + (22-1) = 62 + 21 = 83. The closest option in the answer list is 81. This must be the expected number for that level. Thus, the number after the question mark should correspond to the level 2. The number must be 22+31+31 = 84, but the only answer close to this value is 81.
