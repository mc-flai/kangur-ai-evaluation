Reasoning: The cake is halved twice, and then one of the resulting pieces is halved again, creating pieces that are 1/8th and 1/16th of the original cake. The smallest piece is stated to be 100g. Because there are two of the smallest pieces and the smaller pieces of the cake are one-sixteenth of the cake each, then 2 of the smallest pieces must make up 200g. Since the other section makes up 1/8 of the cake, it must be double the weight of the smallest piece of cake. Therefore, the next larger pieces are 200g each, and 200g * 2 is 400g. The remaining pieces are half the cake each at 400g each. Therefore, the total weight is 200g * 4 + 400g * 2 = 800g + 800g = 1600g.
