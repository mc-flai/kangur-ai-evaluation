Reasoning: Adam knows the color and Bruna knows the shape. They both didn't know initially but now they do. From the image, we can see the possible figures: a green hexagon, a green square, a light pink circle, a green 7-pointed star, a white square, a light pink triangle, and a green triangle. Based on Adam and Bruna's conversation, the figure they both know has to be a shape that has a corresponding color within the shapes presented. Looking at the options, the only combination is the white square (D) because Bruna can know that it is a square and Adam can know that it is white.

Answer: D)
