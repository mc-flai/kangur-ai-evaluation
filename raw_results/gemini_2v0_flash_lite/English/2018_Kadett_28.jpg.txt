Reasoning:
Let 'n' be the number of jumps Viola has taken so far.
The average distance jumped so far is 3.80 m.
The sum of distances jumped so far is 3.80n.
After the next jump (3.99 m), the mean increases to 3.81 m.
So, (3.80n + 3.99) / (n+1) = 3.81
3.  80n + 3.99 = 3.81n + 3.81
4.  01n = -0.18
n = 18
Now, let 'x' be the distance of the next jump.
We need to find 'x' so that (3.80 * 18 + 3.99 + x) / (18+2) = 3.82
(68.4 + 3.99 + x) / 20 = 3.82
72.39 + x = 76.4
x = 76.4 - 72.39
x = 4.01 m
