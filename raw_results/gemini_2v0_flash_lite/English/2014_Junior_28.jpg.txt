Reasoning: Let $\angle TPA = 2x$. Since PB is the angle bisector of $\angle TPA$, we have $\angle TPB = \angle BPA = x$. Let $\angle TBA = y$.
Since PT is a tangent to the circle at A, and AB is a chord, $\angle BAT = \angle BPA = x$ (angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment).
In $\triangle TBP$, we have $\angle TBP + \angle BPT + \angle BTA = 180^\circ$
Therefore, $\angle TBP + x + (x+y) = 180^\circ$
$\angle TBP = y$
In triangle TBP, we have $\angle TBP + x + y = 180^\circ$. So, $y + x + y= 180$.
Consider the angle $\angle TBP$.
Since $\angle TBP = y$ and $\angle BAT = x$ and $\angle BAT = \angle BPA$, we have $\angle BPA = x$. Since $\angle TPB = x$, then $\angle BAT = \angle TPB$.
The sum of angles in $\triangle ABP$ is $180$. $\angle BAP + \angle ABP + \angle APB = 180^\circ$. $x+y+x = 180 - \angle TBP$.
Since $\angle TBP$ is to be found in the diagram, $\angle TBP + x + x = 180^{\circ}$, and $\angle TBP = x$. $2x + y = 180$,
$\angle TAB + \angle TBA = 180$.
Consider $\angle TBP$, we have $\angle TBP + \angle TPB + \angle BPT = 180$.
$\angle TBP = \angle TPA/2$. Also, $\angle TAP = \angle TPB$.
The quadrilateral formed by A, B, and the intersection point of PT with the circle. $\angle TBP$.
$\angle TBP = \frac{1}{2} \angle TPA$.
Also, $\angle BAT = \angle BPA$. Since $\angle TPA = 2\angle TPB$. $\angle TPB = x$. Therefore, $\angle BAP = x$.
In $\triangle TBP$, $\angle TBP + \angle BPT + \angle P = 180^\circ$
Let $\angle TPB = x$. $\angle TPA = 2x$
$\angle BPA = x$. $\angle TBP + x + \angle BPT = 180^\circ$.
Consider the angles: $\angle BPA = x$, $\angle TBP + x + x = 180$. $\angle TBP = x$
Thus $\angle TBP = \angle TPA/2$. Then $\angle TBP = \frac{1}{2} \angle TPA$.
$\angle TBP = x$. $\angle TBA = x$. Since $\angle TPA = 2x$.
In the diagram, $\angle TBP = 45$.
Then, since $\angle TPA$ is bisected to $x$. and $\angle BAT = \angle BPA = x$.

Since PT is a tangent, $\angle PTA$ makes an angle with AB. In $\triangle BPT$, the angles are TBP, TPB, and BTP.
Since PB is the angle bisector of angle TPA, we get TPB = BPA. Also angle BAT = TPB.
Hence, $\angle BAT = \angle TPB$. Let $\angle TPB = x$.
Then $\angle TPA = 2x$. Therefore, $\angle BAT = x$.
So $\angle TBP = \frac{1}{2} \angle TPA$
Then $\angle TBP = x$. So $\angle TPB = x$.
Therefore, angle TBP must be 45 degrees.
