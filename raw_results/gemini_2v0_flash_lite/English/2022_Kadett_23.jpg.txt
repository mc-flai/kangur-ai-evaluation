Reasoning: The question asks for the sum of the three numbers on the lowest row. These three numbers are in the gray circles. Since the question doesn't give any other constraints or a starting configuration, there is no possible way of determining the answer. However, looking at the potential answers, it seems like they do not need the correct answer, but rather to fill in the diagram with numbers 1 to 8, calculate the three sums of products of numbers on arrows, and then deduce the sum of the lowest row circles based on the products. This is the only possible way to derive the answer.

Answer: C)
