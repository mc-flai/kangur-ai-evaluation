Reasoning: The problem gives the equation √(2018² + 2018² + ... + 2018²) = 2018^10. Let 'x' be the number of times 2018² appears under the square root. The left side of the equation can be rewritten as √(x * 2018²) = 2018^10. Taking the square root gives √(x) * 2018 = 2018^10. Dividing both sides by 2018, we have √(x) = 2018^9. Squaring both sides, we get x = 2018^18.
