Reasoning: Each block contains 5 cubes, and the cubes alternate in color (white or grey). We can count the white cubes in each block: Each block has 2 or 3 white cubes. Counting from left to right: first block has 3 white cubes, the next has 2, the next has 3, the next has 2, the next has 2 and the last block has 0 (or the back of the block is not visible). Adding them together: 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 12.
