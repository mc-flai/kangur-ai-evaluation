Reasoning: We need to find four unique whole numbers less than 18 that multiply to 882. We can start by prime factorizing 882: 882 = 2 x 3 x 3 x 7 x 7. Now we can combine the factors into four numbers: 2, 7, 9, and 7 are not unique so we need to try another set. 6, 7, 3 and 7 are not unique either. Let's try 6, 7, 3, 7. We can regroup the factors to find a set of four unique numbers, using 2, 3, 3, 7, 7: 2 x 3 = 6, 3 x 7 = 21 is too big.
Try factors of 882 to find four numbers less than 18: 882 = 1 x 2 x 9 x 49 (49 is too big).
Let's try 1, 2, 9, and another number: 882/18 = 49. Not good, either.
1 x 7 x 9 x 14. 1+7+9+14 = 31.
