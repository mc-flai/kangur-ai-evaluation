Reasoning: The question asks for the sum of the numbers adjacent to 6. The sum of the numbers adjacent to 5 is 9. This is information we will probably not use to solve the problem. We can observe from the given table that numbers adjacent to each other must either have a common side. Since 5 has to be placed in the empty positions, and the digits 1-9 must be filled in a 3x3 grid. We have no information to directly compute the numbers adjacent to 6. So, the problem requires a logical assumption. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 are already present. The remaining digits are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The total sum of these digits is 5+6+7+8+9 = 35. The question has not provided a solution for which arrangement of the numbers results in a specific solution. The problem can only be completed if an assumption is made about the table, which is not specified. This means that the question is impossible to solve. However, since only one answer can be selected, we will guess.
Answer: C)
