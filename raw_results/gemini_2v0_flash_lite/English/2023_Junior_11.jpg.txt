Reasoning: Let the original water usage be $W$ and the original time be $T$. Jennifer reduces water usage by 1/4, meaning water usage becomes $\frac{3}{4}W$.  She also reduces the shower time by 1/4, meaning the new time is $\frac{3}{4}T$. The total water used is proportional to water pressure and time, so the new water usage will be $\frac{3}{4}W \times \frac{3}{4}T = \frac{9}{16}WT$. The reduction in total water usage is $WT - \frac{9}{16}WT = \frac{7}{16}WT$. Thus the fraction reduced is $\frac{7}{16}$.
