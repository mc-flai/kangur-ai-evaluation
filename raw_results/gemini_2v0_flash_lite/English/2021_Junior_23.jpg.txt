Reasoning:
To minimize N, we want to use as many 9's as possible.  2021 divided by 9 is 224 with a remainder of 5. So, N will have 224 digits that are 9, and one digit that is 5 at the beginning. Then, N = 5 followed by 224 nines. We need to find the sum of the digits of N + 2021.

N = 5999...999  (224 nines)
N + 2021 = 5999...999 + 2021 = 7021999...999 (221 nines)

The sum of the digits of N+2021 is 7 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 221*9 = 10 + 1989 = 2000 + 9 = 2010.
However, based on the way the options are listed, it seems there is a flaw in the method.
Let's try another way:
N is made of 224 nines and one 5, in total 225 digits.
N + 2021.
N = 5999...999  (224 nines)
N+2021 = 5999...999 + 2021
Since the number of nines is big, the result will have a "carry over":
5999...999 + 2021 = 6000...000 + 2020 = 7020999...999 (221 nines)
The correct result will be 599...999 + 2021:
(5 + 2) = 7
99...999 + 000 = 99...999
99...999 + 2021 = 99...999 + 2021
599...9 + 2021 = 702199...9
Adding to 5, 2021, we get 7 as the first digit.
Then we need to consider the effect of adding 2021.
7+0+2+1+221*9 = 10+1989 = 2000
The calculation:
   599...999
+  2021
---------
702100...000
The digits: 7 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 220 zeros = 10
So we have to calculate the sums of digits of N + 2021, 7 + 0 + 2 + 1 + (221*9) = 10 + 1989 = 1999+10 = 2000.
The number of nines is 224, so the number of other digits is one "5".
N+2021 = 7021 + 221 * 9 = 2000.
The digits: 7 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 10. The remainder is 10
When we have sum = 2021, N has 224 digits = 9 and a digit of 5 (since 2021 = 224*9 + 5)
So N = 5(224) 9s
Adding 2021 gives :
599...99 + 2021
= 7020...000
So N+2021 = 599...9 + 2021, where the original number has 224 nines. So, the number of digits of N + 2021:
7020. So there are (225 - 4) = 221 digits of 0.  The number looks like 702100...0
599...9 + 2021
The result would be 702100...0. 7+2+1 is only 10, so the nines need to convert.

N+2021:
The last 4 digits are 9999+2021
N = 599...999
702000...0
The result:  5999...9 + 2021= 702100...00
The digit sum is 7+0+2+1 =10

Answer: A)

Reasoning: The sum of the digits of N is 2021. N is the smallest positive integer, so it should have as many 9s as possible. Therefore, the N should have 224 of 9, and 1 of 5.
599..9 + 2021.  It adds as 702100...00. So we have 7+0+2+1+0+0=10.

Answer: A)
