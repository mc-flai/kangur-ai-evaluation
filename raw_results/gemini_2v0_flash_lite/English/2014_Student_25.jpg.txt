Reasoning: First, we prime factorize 54: 54 = 2 * 3^3.  To avoid a product divisible by 54, we must exclude numbers that contain both 2 and 3^3 (27).  We can consider writing down all the numbers from 1 to 100.
*   Numbers divisible by 27: 27, 54, 81. There are three numbers that contains the factor 27, so we must exclude them.
*   If any number is divisible by 2, then the product of the numbers can potentially be divisible by 54. Therefore to avoid having a product that is divisible by 54, we should avoid any number divisible by 2 and 27.  However, we already excluded numbers that are multiples of 27.
*   If our numbers don't include any multiples of 3, we can write down all numbers that are not multiples of 3.
*   We also need to make sure the product is not divisible by 2.

Let's analyze the numbers we can include:
*   Numbers not divisible by 3: We can write down all the numbers not divisible by 3, which includes numbers not divisible by 2 and 27, and the numbers that contain only the factor 2. The numbers that are not divisible by 3 include one factor of 2 but not 27. These include: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41, 43, 44, 46, 47, 49, 50, 52, 53, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 65, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 76, 77, 79, 80, 82, 83, 85, 86, 88, 89, 91, 92, 94, 95, 97, 98, 100. There are 67 numbers.
*   We must exclude numbers divisible by 27: 27, 54, 81.  However, if all other numbers don't share factors of 2 and 3, then we can not use them.
* Numbers divisible by 27 (27, 54, 81). So we can write down all numbers except those divisible by 3 or multiples of 27.  The numbers not divisible by 3 are 100 - 33 = 67, so remove 27, 54, 81. 67 - 3 = 67-0 = 67?

We can list the number of positive integers $\leq 100$ that are divisible by 3:
3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99. There are 33 numbers.

We can write down at most 100 - 33 = 67 numbers.
Then, the number of integers <= 100 which are NOT divisible by 3 is 100 - floor(100/3) = 100 - 33 = 67.
The maximum number of integers is 67 + 2 = 69.

We can find the number of integers in the range [1, 100] that are divisible by 3. These are 3, 6, ..., 99. The number of such integers is floor(100/3) = 33. Thus, if we exclude those integers, we have 100 - 33 = 67 integers remaining.

The integers we can write down are those which have no prime factor of 3 and are not 27, 54, 81.
If we only consider the numbers that do not contain 3, they are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41, 43, 44, 46, 47, 49, 50, 52, 53, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 65, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 76, 77, 79, 80, 82, 83, 85, 86, 88, 89, 91, 92, 94, 95, 97, 98, 100.  Count = 67.
If we write down all the numbers which don't have 3 as factor, we are good to go. 67 numbers. We can add two more numbers without the factor of 3?

Answer: D) 69
