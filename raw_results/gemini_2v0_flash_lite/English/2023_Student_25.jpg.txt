Reasoning: The question states that all zeros of the polynomial are integers. The expression asks for the highest power of (x-1) that divides the polynomial. A polynomial of degree five has five roots. If we substitute x=1 into the polynomial, we get 1 - 11 + something - 7 = something - 17.
For (x-1) to be a factor, when we substitute x=1, the result must be 0, so we need to consider how many times x=1 can be a root to determine what power of (x-1) divides this polynomial. If x=1 is a root 'n' times, then (x-1)^n is a factor. Since we don't know the other terms, we cannot figure this out, so let's consider the other factors: If 1 is a root k times, then (x-1)^k divides the polynomial. However, the question doesn't tell us the roots, so we need a rule to apply, or the polynomial itself. Let's look at the constant term: If all roots are integers, then (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)(x-d)(x-e) = x^5 + ... + -abcde. The constant term will be the product of the roots, and it is -7, which means the product of the roots will be an integer that multiplies to -7. If 1 is a root, let's assume x=1. Then (x-1) must divide the polynomial. If it does, then the polynomial at x=1 is 0.
But if x=1 is a root of the polynomial, and x=1 is a root n times. then (x-1)^n is a factor. Since the constant is -7, and all roots are integers, the only possible roots include factors of 7 and other integers.
We know that (x-1) is a possible factor if 1 is a root. The question asks what *is* the highest power.
We cannot determine the highest power that divides the polynomial directly from the given information, because we do not know the actual polynomial. However, we are told the polynomial has degree five. Let's analyze the roots. The constant term is -7, which is prime, meaning the possible integer roots must be factors of 7 or -7, and possibly 1 or -1. If x=1 is a root, we cannot determine how many times this occurs. However, the choices presented suggests that the highest power is likely to be small, and the degree of the polynomial is 5. Given the limitations on factors, any other integer factor can be -1 or 1.
Without knowing the exact expression, however, we can only assume that the factor (x-1) might occur once or more. So the highest possible power for an arbitrary case can be the power of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

If the answer isn't (x-1), (x-1)^2, (x-1)^3, (x-1)^4, or (x-1)^5, then a direct approach is needed. However, since the constant term is -7, the possible rational roots based on the rational root theorem are limited: 1, -1, 7, -7. Let x=1.
Since all zeros are integers, we need to look at the product of the roots, which must be 7 (since if we let the leading term be positive and the polynomial be x^5...-7, and all the coefficients are real, if x=1, the polynomial will be x^5 - 11x^4, + ...-7). The highest power of x-1 will depend on the number of times 1 is a root.
Let's assume 1 is a root, so x-1 is a factor. If x-1 is the only factor of -7, then the product of the roots must be -7. However, x-1 occurs at least once. There are two cases: The answer should be that the polynomial is divisible by (x-1).
Reasoning: The constant term is -7. Thus, if we substitute x=1 into the polynomial and evaluate, the result will be based on the other terms. We are given that all roots are integers. We need to find out what is the highest power of x-1 divides this polynomial. If we put x=1 in the polynomial, if the polynomial is 0, then it is certainly divisible by x-1, if it is not then it is not divisible by x-1. We don't have the complete polynomial to use this approach directly, but it must be divisible by x-1. If the roots are integers, the constant term is -7, so the possible roots can be 1, -1, 7, -7. Since we don't know the other factors, or the polynomial, this cannot be answered exactly. If we are considering the case where x=1, then it is a factor. The roots are integers, and we want the highest power of x-1. The options are just that x-1. Thus, we need to evaluate, if we consider the polynomial, and we can rewrite the polynomial in this form (x-1).
