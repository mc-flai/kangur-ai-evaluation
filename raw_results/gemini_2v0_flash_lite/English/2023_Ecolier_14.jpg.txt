Reasoning: The problem states that in any three consecutive animals, there's exactly one kangaroo. Let's consider the options and check for which number a kangaroo would be. Since there are only two kangaroos, the kangaroo positions must repeat. We can place kangaroos at 2 and 5 to fulfill the conditions. A) If 1 is a kangaroo then, 2 and 3 should be beavers, and 4 must be a kangaroo. B) If 2 is a kangaroo, then 1 and 3 should be beavers, meaning kangaroo could be at 5. C) If 3 is a kangaroo then 2 and 4 would have to be beavers, and 1, 5 should be kangaroos. D) If 4 is a kangaroo then 1, 2, 3 can't be kangaroos, so if 5 is a kangaroo, then 1 and 3 is a kangaroo. E) If 5 is a kangaroo then 2 is a kangaroo. Thus we can see that kangaroos are at the numbers 2 and 5.

Answer: B)
