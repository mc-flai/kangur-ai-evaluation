Reasoning: The area of the quadrilateral ABCD is the sum of the areas of the triangles formed by the diagonals. We are given the areas of two of the triangles, which are 10 and 5. Let the areas of the other two triangles be S and T. Since A and D are right angles, the area of the triangle with area 10 and the triangle with area 5 are related. The ratio of the areas 10/5 = 2 should also be equal to the ratio of the areas T/S. Because the triangles share a common altitude, the product of the areas of the opposite triangles is equal to the product of the areas of the other two triangles. Thus 10 * 5 = S * T = 50.  We see that the total area is 10+5+T+S. Also, note that since the quadrilateral has right angles at A and D, and given the segments that form T and S, the triangles formed share the same height, so the areas are in ratio T/5 = S/10. Cross multiplying yields 10T = 5S or S = 2T. Because ST = 50 and S = 2T, then 2T^2 = 50, T^2 = 25, and T = 5 (Since area cannot be negative). S = 2T = 10. Then the total area is 10+5+10+5=30.
