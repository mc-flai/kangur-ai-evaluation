Reasoning: Let's analyze the animal transformations:
- Wolf eating a goat -> Lion
- Lion eating a goat -> Wolf
- Lion eating a wolf -> Goat
Notice that the total number of animals of each kind changes by a multiple of 1. This means, if we keep track of the sum (Goats + Wolves + Lions), it will be conserved modulo 3.

The initial state: 17 goats + 55 wolves + 6 lions = 78
78 mod 3 = 0
The animals stop eating when the transformations are no longer possible. From the cycles described, the only way is for all the animals to be the same.

Because 78 mod 3 = 0, the final configuration will consist of a number of animals which is a multiple of 3. We need to maximize the total number of animals on the island. We have 17 goats, 55 wolves, and 6 lions. The smallest group of animals can be goats, because the transformations described above imply that there is at least one goat.

Consider if the lions could eat all of the goats. 6 lions could eat 6 goats changing into 6 wolves.
So the states can be:
17 - 6 goats, 55+6 wolves, 6 lions = 11 goats, 61 wolves, 6 lions.
If there are 11 goats and 6 lions, they cannot be changed, so the only animal can be the wolf.
If the lions consume all the wolves, then a lion that eats a wolf will change into a goat, and then a lion will eat the remaining goats and change to a wolf.
If the wolf can eat the goat, then it becomes a lion.
So if we want to get rid of as many different animals as possible, then we must have 1 type of animal left.
If all the animals are of the same kind, then we have 17 goats, 55 wolves, and 6 lions.
Case 1: If all are goats: 17 goats +55 wolves (becomes lions) + 6 lions (becomes wolves). Wolves can eat goats and become lions.
Case 2: If all are wolves. lions eats wolves (becomes goats) Goats eats lions (become wolves).
Case 3: If all are lions.

If there is at least one animal of each species (goat, wolf, lion), then the animals will be continuously transformed.
If all animals are of one type, the total amount of animals is 17 + 55 + 6 = 78.
Since the number is a multiple of 3, it can be 3 goats, 3 wolves, and 3 lions.
If all the animals are of one type, and no more eating is possible. The minimal case should be: 6 lions.
If we had 17 goats, then these goats will become lions, which in turn become wolves, which in turn become goats.
Since 17 + 55 + 6 = 78.
If there is one goat, it will become a lion, which will become a wolf, which will eat the goat and change to a lion.

Suppose the island is only filled with lions. The final amount is 17 (Goats) + 55 (Wolves) + 6 (Lions) = 78
If we divide it by 3, the answer would be a number that can be achieved. If all the lions eat the other animals and change into goats, the total amount will be 17 goats, 55 wolves + 6 lions.
We can observe: 17 goats, 55 wolves, 6 lions = 78
78 / 3 = 26
Then, let's consider one case that we only have the goats remaining, 17 goats.
Or just have one type of animal remain, if all of the animals are lions, the number will be 6
78/3 = 26. The minimum will be 1 animal
If we start with 6 lions only, there will be 6 animals.
If we start with 17 goats. The goats can change.
Let's assume the final state is 17.
