Reasoning:
The first scale shows that one triangle and one yellow square with the pink arrow are equivalent to one triangle and two circles. This implies that one yellow square with the pink arrow is equivalent to two circles. The second scale shows that three yellow squares are equivalent to one triangle and one circle. The third scale has one yellow square and one pink arrow, which we know is equal to two circles, so we are looking for the option that is equal to two circles. Option C has one triangle, three circles and one yellow square, and we know that one yellow square is equivalent to two circles, the other scale tells us that 1 triangle and one circle are equivalent to three yellow squares. Replacing one yellow square with two circles results in one triangle + 3 circles + two circles = one triangle + five circles. That means one yellow square plus the pink arrow (which is 2 circles) should equal to option C. This would make our answer correct.

Answer: C)
