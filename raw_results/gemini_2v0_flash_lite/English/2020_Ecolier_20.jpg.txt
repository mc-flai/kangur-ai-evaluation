Reasoning:
Let's analyze each person's statement to see if it's consistent with the final statement that "Today is Monday."
*   **Adam:** If today is Monday, then yesterday was Sunday. So, Adam is wrong if he said yesterday was Wednesday.
*   **Beto:** If today is Monday, then tomorrow will be Tuesday. Beto is wrong if he said tomorrow will be Friday.
*   **Carlos:** If today is Monday, then the day before yesterday was Saturday. Carlos is wrong if he said the day before yesterday was Tuesday.
*   **David:** If today is Monday, then the day after tomorrow is Wednesday. David is wrong if he said the day after tomorrow is Saturday.
*   **Eli:** Eli said today is Monday. This is consistent with the ending statement.
Because the end of the conversation stated that "Today is Monday", we should check each statement against that ending statement. If we assume today is Monday, and if the previous day was Wednesday, then it contradicts what Eli said.
