Reasoning:
1. The circle's diameter is equal to the side of the small square, and also half the side of the big square.
2. The circle is positioned such that the center of the circle is located along a horizontal line 6 cm from the top and 8 cm from the left.
3. Since the circle touches the right side of the square in its midpoint, then the horizontal line of the diameter is equal to the length of the half side.
4. The total length is therefore (8 cm + 8 cm) + (6 cm + 6cm).
5. Since the diagram is not drawn to scale, the radius of the circle is 6 cm.
6.  The side length of the small square is twice the radius = 12 cm.
7. The side length of the large square is twice the side length of the small square = 24 cm.
