Reasoning: Ronja has 4 white tokens and Wanja has 4 grey tokens. They take turns placing tokens, and Ronja goes first. This means that the first token placed is white. We analyze each option:
A) Has 3 grey and 1 white token. Total is 4 tokens. The white token must have been placed first by Ronja. This is a possible state.
B) Has 3 grey and 3 white tokens. Total is 6 tokens. Ronja places the first white, Wanja places the first grey, and so on. This is a possible state.
C) Has 2 grey and 2 white tokens. Total is 4 tokens. Ronja places the first white, which means the piles can contain any number of white tokens. This is a possible state.
D) Has 2 grey and 2 white tokens. Total is 4 tokens. Ronja places the first white, which means the piles can contain any number of white tokens. This is a possible state.
E) Has 1 grey and 3 white tokens. Total is 4 tokens. The white token must have been placed first by Ronja. This is a possible state.
Since, each of the stacks A-E seem to have 4 total whites and greys, we look at the first turn. Since Ronja goes first, we can eliminate any possibility of the stacks having more than 4 tokens.
The possibilities seem correct, let's consider the other possibility.
If all tokens are used there will be 8 total tokens in total.
If we consider which scenarios will not be possible. In all the options total amount of tokens is 8, we can make sure that no token will be more than 4 white and 4 grey. Since Ronja goes first, at most, Ronja can place 4 tokens. If we look at B, there are 3 white tokens. If Ronja places the white tokens in the first pile, and the 3 gray tokens in the second pile, we can see that the 3 white and the 3 grey can be separated. So if we combine the piles with the tokens, we can create the scenario in B. We look at E. There are 1 grey and 3 white tokens. With Ronja's white token first. The scenarios A, B, C, D and E are all possible.

Since they are taking turns, and Ronja plays first. The total amount of tokens is 8. If one pile does not have any white tokens, this is impossible.
Considering, that Ronja plays first and has 4 white tokens. Wanja has 4 grey tokens.
The options A, B, C, D are all possible. However, E is not possible because if we combine them, the piles have 4 tokens, 3 white and 1 grey. The white tokens must have been placed first, so this scenario is possible.
If we look at B, 3 white and 3 grey, the total is 6 tokens.
If we look at E, 3 white and 1 grey, the total is 4 tokens.
If we look at B, Ronja starts with a white token.

If we start with A, this must have been possible.
If we start with E, Ronja has 3 whites. Wanja places grey. This is possible.
Considering the tokens and the number of them, there are 8 tokens in total.

The options seem all possible, so the question is wrong. The instruction states that there is a single answer.

Let's look again at the options.
Option A has 3 grey, 1 white. The white token is placed first. This is possible.
Option B has 3 grey, 3 white. The white token is placed first. This is possible.
Option C has 2 grey, 2 white. The white token is placed first. This is possible.
Option D has 2 grey, 2 white. The white token is placed first. This is possible.
Option E has 1 grey, 3 white. The white token is placed first. This is possible.

If we consider that the tokens must be separated, this is possible.
However, let's assume that the tokens must have at least one white token.
The options must be a pair of piles.
Considering the sum of the tokens is 8, and there must be a minimum of 1 of each color in each pile.
Option A has a total of 4. 1 white and 3 grey.
Option B has a total of 6.
Option C has a total of 4.
Option D has a total of 4.
Option E has a total of 4.

Option B needs 6.
Option A has 4. If we see the piles are made of only one type.
Option E would be 3 whites and 1 grey. 4 tokens.
If the answer is E. Then we have 3 white tokens and 1 grey. If Ronja started with a white token.
If the white tokens are in one pile. Then we have 3 white and then the grey, total 4.
This works.
If the solution is B. It requires 6 tokens. The solution can be B. If it is a pair of piles.
The solution must be E.

If we consider there should be at least one token in each pile, the answer should be a pair of piles that cannot be created.
The answer should be that both have to include at least one token of each color.

If we consider the constraint, that each pile should have tokens of both colours.
This eliminates options A,C,D,E, we can see B requires 6 tokens. Since there is only 8 total tokens, we can only make 2 piles each with a total of 4. Since Ronja placed the first white token, the piles has a total of 8 tokens. If one pile contains only white tokens and one pile contains only grey tokens, this is not possible. However, we can choose to form it such as option B. In B, it needs 6 tokens. It has to be 2 piles. With 3 white and 3 grey. The total number of tokens should be 8.
Option B requires 6 tokens, and the solution is a pair of piles. Total tokens can be 8.
Total tokens are 8. Each player can play up to 4. Ronja played first.

If we consider the sum of the number of tokens, each of the items can be formed.
We consider the piles should have at least one token of each color.
Looking at the pairs of piles, since there should be two piles. Then the number of tokens should have to be 8.
There are 4 of each color.
Considering Ronja played first. If we combine two piles, the answer must be E.
If E, the pair would be 3 white, 1 grey, and 1 white, 3 grey. This does not make sense.

The only answer is E.

Reasoning: Ronja places the first token, which is white. Each pile must have at least one white token. Examining the options, E is the one that will not work because if we sum the total, 3 white and 1 grey token. Since Ronja starts the game. If Ronja played first, she had 4 white tokens. If we check each option. We know that there has to be 2 pairs. E can be formed. Ronja would have 3 whites. 1 grey. If all the white tokens are in the one pile.
The total should be 8. Since Ronja went first.
Let us analyze each option by checking the pairs. The pair can be A.
The answer has to be A.

Answer: A)
