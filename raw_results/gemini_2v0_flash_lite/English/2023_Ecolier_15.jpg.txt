Reasoning: To determine the minimum number of colors, we need to consider the graph coloring problem. The goal is to color the nodes (circles) such that no two adjacent nodes (connected by a line) have the same color. We can start by coloring one circle with a color, and then the circles connected to it must have different colors. We can visually try to color the diagram and see how many colors are needed. Observing the diagram, the central node has 3 neighbors that must be distinct from the center and from each other. The other nodes require the other colors. So we could color the circles in the following way. Use color 1 for the center node. Use color 2 and 3 for the nodes connected to it in the top portion and use color 4, 5, and 6 for the neighbors of color 1 on the sides and bottom. We can see that at least 3 colors can be used in this case.
