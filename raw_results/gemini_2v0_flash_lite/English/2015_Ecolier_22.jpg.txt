Reasoning: We can visualize the grid of 9 dots as a 3x3 grid. We can form squares of different sizes by connecting 4 dots. The squares that can be made are:
1.  A 1x1 square formed by connecting adjacent dots.
2.  A 2x2 square formed by the outer dots.
3. A tilted square can be formed whose vertices lie at the corners.
