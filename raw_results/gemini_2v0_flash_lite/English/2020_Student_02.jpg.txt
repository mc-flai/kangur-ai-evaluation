Reasoning:
The ant initially walks 6 m. The cylinder has a height of 1 meter. When the cylinder is introduced, the ant's path from A to B can be broken down into three segments: a segment from A to the top of the cylinder, the segment along the cylinder's circumference, and a segment from the bottom of the cylinder to B.
The problem states that the cylinder is 1 meter high. However, it doesn't specify the position of the cylinder within the original 6 m path. It also doesn't state the radius of the cylinder. Without knowing the radius of the cylinder (or the circumference of the cylinder), we can't calculate the distance the ant traverses along it. Therefore, assuming the circumference of the cylinder is a certain amount of meters, the correct answer has to be calculated by doing the math. However, because we don't have any information about the cylinder other than its height, we will consider that the ant walks along the straight line. In that case, the cylinder doesn't affect the distance. The ant continues walking 6 meters from point A to point B. Therefore, the correct answer must be 6 meters, plus the additional distance the ant walks on top of the cylinder, where she climbs up the cylinder, and goes down. Because the ant is "on the same straight line", it is walking 6 meters. The correct answer must be 6 + 1 +1 or 8 m.
However, there's no information about the cylinder radius in the problem. If we assume that the path continues on a straight line and the height of the cylinder only makes the ant go "up and down", and therefore, if we think about it as a right triangle: A to top of cylinder + cylinder height + bottom of cylinder to B, then we have the path from A to B being 6 m. Since we have no information about the cylinder radius, this is the only assumption possible. Because the question doesn't give us any numbers, we have to make this assumption. From point A to the point where the cylinder starts, we don't know the distance, nor from the other point. We have to consider the distance that the ant has traveled, so, if we go straight from point A to B, the ant walks 6 meters. Therefore, the cylinder doesn't change the distance, because it is said "on the same straight line". If the cylinder would be in a curve, then the distance would be greater.
