Reasoning:
1. **Analyze the Shelves**: Observe the two shelves of bottles. Notice that one shelf has 3 large bottles and 1 small bottle and the other one has 3 medium bottles and 2 small bottles.
2. **Hypothesize the sizes**: It's difficult to determine exact volumes with visual information only. We can guess the sizes of the bottles (L, M, S).
3. **Estimate the bottle volume**: The question is: How many deciliters of apple juice does a medium bottle contain?
4. **Solving the problem**: The number of bottles are (3 large + 1 small) and (3 medium + 2 small) and the total is 64 deciliters. The question is asking how much apple juice a medium bottle contains. In the first shelf, there are 3 Large, 1 Small and 20 deciliters in total. If we assume one medium bottle has 8 deciliters. Then 3 medium bottles have 24 deciliters and 2 small bottles have 8 deciliters. That means the second shelf (3M + 2S) can have 24 + 8 deciliters. Then, the first shelf has 3 large bottles and 1 small bottle. So, 2 shelves will have 6 Large, 3 Medium and 3 Small. We can then try to see how the volume fits in these different sizes. Then we see if the answers fit these sizes.

If one Medium has 8 deciliters:
* 3 Medium = 24 deciliters
* 2 Small = 2 * 4 deciliters
* then the first shelf may have the same total.

Answer: C)
