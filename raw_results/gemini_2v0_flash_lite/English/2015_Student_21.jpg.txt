Reasoning: The question asks to determine the first true statement from a list of statements. We need to evaluate them in order (A to E) until we find one that is true.
*   (A) states "(C) is true". We cannot evaluate this yet because we do not know if (C) is true.
*   (B) states "(A) is true". We cannot evaluate this yet because we do not know if (A) is true.
*   (C) states "(E) is false". We cannot evaluate this yet because we do not know if (E) is false.
*   (D) states "(B) is false". We cannot evaluate this yet because we do not know if (B) is false.
*   (E) states "1 + 1 = 2". This is a basic mathematical truth and is therefore true. Because we check the statements in order, and this is the first true statement found, this is the answer.

Answer: E)
