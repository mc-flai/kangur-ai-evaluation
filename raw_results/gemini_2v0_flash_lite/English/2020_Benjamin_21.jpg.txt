Reasoning:
The area of the large gray square is 81. The areas of two white squares are 9 and 4. To find the area of the missing white square, we can calculate the side of the larger gray square by the square root of 81, which is 9. Since the white squares are parallel to the sides of the gray square, the sides of the large gray square can also be represented by the sum of the sides of the three white squares. If we consider the sides of the squares 9 and 4, we can calculate the side of each of the white squares: The side of the square with area 9 is sqrt(9) = 3. The side of the square with area 4 is sqrt(4) = 2. The side of the gray square is 9 (sqrt(81)=9) . The missing square side can be found by taking away from the side of the gray square the known values of the sides of the white squares on two different sides. so the sum of both sides equals the gray area, which is (3 + x = 9) and (2+ x = 9). since they share the value of x then x= 9 -3 = 6 and 9-2 =7, x is the only value the both share. then the missing value can be found where the sides of the 2 white squares touch each other, then the value would be  3 + 2 -9=4, or 9-3-2 = 4. The area of the missing white square is 3*2=6. Thus, if the area of the missing square is 6, then the remaining area of white squares inside the gray area is 9 + 4 + 36 = 49.  Since the area of the gray square is 81, the gray area not covered by the white squares can be calculated as: 81 - (9 + 4 + 36) = 81 - 49 = 32.

Area of the third white square = 36
Area of the 3 white squares = 9 + 4 + 36 = 49
Area of the gray area not covered = 81 - 49 = 32, but the answer is not among the options, let's try again
The third white square has the dimensions 9-(3+2)=4 and the missing area equals to 36 and the answer is not among the answers again. Let's try another aproach:

We know the area of the gray square is 81. We also have the area of the white squares: 9 and 4.  Let's add the areas of the white squares: 9 + 4 = 13. Then, we will substract from the total gray area: 81 - 9 - 4 = 68, but this solution is not among the available. 68 is the solution if the white squares are apart, but we know there are 3.
The side of the square with area 9 is 3. The side of the square with area 4 is 2. The side of the gray square is 9.  Then the sum of two adjacent sides of the white squares should be 9. Side of square with area 9 is 3. Side of square with area 4 is 2.
Then 3+2+x=9, which makes x=4.
Area of white squares are 9, 4, 4*4=16.
Total white area is 9+4+16=29. Gray area not covered = 81-29=52
