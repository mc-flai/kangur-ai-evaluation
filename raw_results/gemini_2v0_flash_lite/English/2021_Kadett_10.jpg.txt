Reasoning: We can translate the given information into equations to compare Aaron's and Erin's heights. Let's assign variables:
*   A = Aaron's height
*   B = Byron's height
*   C = Caron's height
*   D = Darren's height
*   E = Erin's height

Now we write the equations from the problem:
*   B = A + 5
*   B = C - 10
*   D = C + 10
*   D = E - 5

From B = C - 10 and D = C + 10, it follows that D is taller than B by 20cm. Also, from D = E - 5, then E = D + 5.
So, the order of heights is: E > D > B
Using B = C - 10 and D = C + 10, we get Erin (D + 5) = C + 15, which gives Erin is 15cm taller than Caron.
Now, we relate these heights to Aaron. From the initial equations we also know that
*   C = B + 10
*   A = B - 5

So, C = A + 15. Then Erin's height is C + 15 = (A + 15) + 15 = A + 30. Therefore Erin is 30cm taller than Aaron and it is the same as Aaron being 30cm shorter than Erin.
