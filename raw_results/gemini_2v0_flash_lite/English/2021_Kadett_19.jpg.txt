Reasoning: The problem states that the box has twice as many apples as pears, and Christy has twice as many pieces of fruit as Lily. We need to deduce which statement is always true.

Let's analyze each option:
(A) Christy took at least one pear. This is not necessarily true. Christy could have only taken apples and the total number of apples is more than pears.
(B) Christy took twice as many apples as pears. This isn't necessarily true because the total number of apples is more than pears.
(C) Christy took twice as many apples as Lily. This isn't necessarily true. We know Christy has twice as many fruits as Lily, but we don't know about the apple distribution.
(D) Christy took as many apples as Lily got pears. Let's say Lily gets 'x' pears. Christy has twice as many fruits as Lily, so Christy gets 2*Lily's fruits. Also, the box has twice as many apples as pears. The number of apples and pears Lily got has to be the same. If Christy took the same number of apples as Lily took pears then it would mean that Christy would have more fruits than Lily, which contradicts that Christy has twice as many pieces of fruit as Lily.
(E) Christy took as many pears as Lily got apples. We can deduce that the number of pears in the box is half of apples. If Christy took as many pears as Lily got apples, and Christy and Lily divided the box of fruit, and Christy has twice as many pieces of fruit than Lily, and the number of pears is half the number of apples, then it is impossible that Christy took as many pears as Lily got apples.
Let's consider a scenario where the number of fruits are minimal:
Apples = 4, Pears = 2
Lily has x fruits, Christy has 2x fruits
x + 2x = 4 + 2, 3x = 6, x=2, means Lily has 2 fruits, and Christy has 4 fruits.
If Christy has 4 fruits, then let's assume:
Christy has: 3 Apples, 1 Pear
Lily has: 1 Apple, 1 Pear.
This contradicts the statements.

Let's use another set of numbers:
Apples = 6, Pears = 3
Lily = 3 fruits, Christy = 6 fruits
Lily has 2 apples and 1 pear, Christy has 4 apples and 2 pears.

If Lily took 1 apple, then Christy took 1 pear. (This is in accordance with the original statements). Then Christy took as many pears as lily got apples, is correct.
If Lily took 2 apples, then Christy took 2 pears.

If we let Lily have x apples, then Christy must take all the remaining apples and x pears.
The answer is (D) because if Lily has some pears then she has a same number of apples as well.
Let Lily have x pears and x apples, total 2x fruits. Christy will have 4x fruits. The total apples are twice of the total pears.

The statement that can always be true is: (D)

Answer: D)
