Reasoning: The question asks us to identify which cube can be formed by folding the flat pattern. We need to visualize how the flat pattern folds. We can observe from the pattern that:
1. The red face is adjacent to the green, green is adjacent to the blue, and blue to the orange and the other way around.
2. The purple face is adjacent to the red and has to be opposite of the orange face.
3. The cube in option A fits this pattern.
4. The other cubes have a different color combination.
Answer: A)
