Reasoning:
The problem states that the two smallest numbers have a product of 16. The factor pairs of 16 are (1, 16) and (2, 8) and (4,4). Since no two numbers are the same, the smallest numbers must be 1 and 16 or 2 and 8. Given that the two largest have a product of 225, we can find the square root of 225, which is 15. The factor pairs of 225 are (1,225) and (3, 75), (5,45), (9, 25) and (15,15). Since all numbers must be different, the two largest numbers must be 15 and 15. Therefore, the two largest numbers are 9 and 25, or 15 and 15. So, the sequence of natural numbers must be 1, 16, 15, 15, 25,  or the product is 2*8 and the numbers must be 8 and 2, and 15 and 15 or 9 and 25. So, the numbers must be 2, 8, 9, 25 or 1, 16, 15, 15. We can have the numbers 2, 8, 9, 25 or 1, 16, 9, 25 and the numbers must be 1, 16, 9, 25. The product of the smallest numbers is 16(1x16), and the product of the two largest is 225 (9x25), the numbers on the board must be 1, 9, 16 and 25. Adding them up: 1 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 51. The sequence should be 2, 8, 9, 25 or 2, 8, 15, 15. The sum of the numbers is: 2 + 8 + 9 + 25 = 44.
