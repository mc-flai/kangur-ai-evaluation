Reasoning: The question states Dorli writes three consecutive natural numbers and replaces the digits with symbols. The given numbers are represented as □◇◇, ♡ΔΔ, ♡Δ□. We need to find the next consecutive number. Analyzing the pattern, we can deduce the following:

1.  The first number is two digits long and has two of the same symbol at the end.  The number is followed by a 3 digit number that starts with another symbol.
2.  The second number, the third number starts with the same symbol as the second and has two of the same symbol at the end.
3.  The third number has the symbol from the second number in the middle, and then a single new symbol at the end.
4.  The only digit that can follow would start with the symbol from the second number in the question.
5.  The second symbol should then follow with the symbol used in the middle of the second number.
6.  The final symbol then needs to be the last one in the question, which means the third symbol.

Following the logic and analysis the next number will be ♡♡♡, which can be represented as (A).

Answer: A)
