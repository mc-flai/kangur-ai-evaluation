Reasoning: The question asks for the number of ways to spell "BANANA" in the grid. We need to trace the path starting from B, then A, N, A, N, A. Since we can revisit fields, this requires considering the paths from each letter to the next, and we can go back to the previous visited character or we can go to the next.
*   There are 2 ways to get the first B.
*   From the top left B, there are 2 ways to move to A (above or to the right).
*   From the bottom left B, there are also 2 ways to get the first A.
*   The A's have 2 ways to move to N.
*   The N has 2 ways to move to A.
*   The A's have 2 ways to move to N.
*   The N has only 1 way to move to A.
*   So the calculation is as follows:
    *   B (2 choices)
    *   A (2 + 2 = 4 ways)
    *   N (2 + 2 = 4 ways)
    *   A (2 + 2 = 4 ways)
    *   N (2 + 2 = 4 ways)
    *   A (1 way).

We consider the paths: B-> A -> N -> A -> N -> A.
Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1.  B to A: There are 2 possible A's for each B.
2.  A to N: There are 2 possible N's for each A.
3.  N to A: There are 2 possible A's for each N.
4.  A to N: There are 2 possible N's for each A.
5.  N to A: There is only 1 possible A.
The total number of possible ways is 2 \* 2 \* 2 \* 2 \* 1 = 64 ways
