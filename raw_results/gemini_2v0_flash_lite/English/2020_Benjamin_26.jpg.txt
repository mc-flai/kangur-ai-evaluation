Reasoning: A number is divisible by 18 if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.
For a number to be balanced, let the digits be a, b, c. Then b = (a+c)/2, which means (a+c) must be even, since 2b is an integer. This also means that a and c are either both even or both odd.
For the number to be divisible by 2, c must be even. Thus, a must also be even.
For the number to be divisible by 9, the sum of the digits must be divisible by 9, which is a+b+c = a + (a+c)/2 + c = (3a+3c)/2 = (3/2)*(a+c). Since the expression must be an integer, and a+c is always even, we get the condition that a+c must be a multiple of 6. Since the middle digit is b, which is the mean of a and c, then 2b = a+c. Since a+c needs to be multiple of 6, it can be 6, 12, or 18.
When a+c = 6, (a,c) = (2,4), (4,2), (6,0), (0,6). b = 3 for all these four cases, and we have four balanced numbers. The numbers are 234, 432, 630, 036 (not a 3 digit number)
When a+c = 12, (a,c) = (4,8), (8,4), (6,6). b = 6 for all these three cases. and we have three balanced numbers. The numbers are 468, 864, 666.
When a+c = 18, (a,c) = (9,9), which gives us the balanced number 999. Then b = 9.
Now, check which numbers are divisible by 18.
234/18 = 13,
432/18 = 24,
630/18 = 35,
468/18 = 26,
864/18 = 48,
666/18 = 37,
999/18 = 55.5 (not divisible by 18)
Therefore, we have 234, 432, 630, 468, 864, and 666 as the balanced numbers that are divisible by 18. The numbers are 234, 432, 630, 468, 864, 666.
The number of balanced numbers is 6.
