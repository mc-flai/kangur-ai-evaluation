Reasoning: We need to find three numbers from the list whose sum, when squared, results in the smallest possible value. To minimize the square, we want to get the sum as close to zero as possible.  Let's consider a few combinations:
*   (-5) + (-3) + 7 = -1.  (-1)^2 = 1
*   (-3) + (-1) + 2 = -2. (-2)^2 = 4
*   (-5) + 2 + 3 is not possible because 3 is not on the list
*   (-5)+ 0 + 2 = -3. (-3)^2 = 9
*   -3 + -1 + 0 = -4. (-4)^2 = 16
The smallest result we found is 1.
