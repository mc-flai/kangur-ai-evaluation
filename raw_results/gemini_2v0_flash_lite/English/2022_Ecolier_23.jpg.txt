Reasoning: The big cube is made up of three shapes, and one of those shapes is a single cube. The big cube is 3x3x3, with a total of 27 small cubes. The L-shaped blocks have 3 small cubes each, and there are 4 of them, for a total of 12 cubes. The rectangular blocks have 2 small cubes each, and there are 2 of them, for a total of 4 cubes. The number of small white cubes can be calculated as: 27 - 12 - 4 = 11.
