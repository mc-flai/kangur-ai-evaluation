Reasoning: Let's denote the goals scored by the other three players as x, y, and z, and Michael's goals as m. We know x + y + z = 20. We also know that x, y, z, and m are all different integers. Since Michael scored the fewest goals, m must be the smallest number of goals. To maximize m, we need to minimize x, y, and z while still ensuring they are distinct and greater than m.

If m = 4, then x, y, and z can be 5, 6, and 9 (5 + 6 + 9 = 20).
If m = 5, then we can't find three different integers that are greater than 5 and sum up to 20. The smallest three distinct integers greater than 5 are 6, 7, and 8 (6 + 7 + 8 = 21).
Thus, the maximum number of goals Michael could have scored is 4.
