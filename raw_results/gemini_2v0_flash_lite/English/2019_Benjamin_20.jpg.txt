Reasoning: The question asks how many of the six numbers in the circles are divisible by 3. Let's call the number in the first circle 'x'. The operations performed are +1, +1, *3, +2, *2.
- Circle 1: x
- Circle 2: x+1
- Circle 3: x+2
- Circle 4: 3(x+2)
- Circle 5: 3(x+2) + 2 = 3x + 8
- Circle 6: 2(3x+8) = 6x+16

Now let's consider the divisibility by 3.
- Circle 1: x can be divisible by 3 if x=3k (1 possibility)
- Circle 2: x+1 can be divisible by 3 if x+1 = 3k => x=3k-1 (1 possibility)
- Circle 3: x+2 can be divisible by 3 if x+2 = 3k => x=3k-2 (1 possibility)
- Circle 4: 3(x+2) is always divisible by 3 (1 possibility)
- Circle 5: 3x + 8 = 3x+6+2 = 3(x+2) + 2 which is not divisible by 3. (0 possibilities)
- Circle 6: 6x+16 = 6x+15+1 = 3(2x+5)+1 which is not divisible by 3 (0 possibilities)

So we have at least 1 number (circle 4) is always divisible by 3. We can see that it is possible for x to be divisible by 3. Or, it could be that none is divisible by 3.
If x=1, then the numbers will be 1, 2, 3, 9, 17, 34. Only 3 and 9 are divisible by 3. Thus, 2 numbers.
If x=2, then the numbers will be 2, 3, 4, 12, 20, 40. Only 3 and 12 are divisible by 3. Thus, 2 numbers.
If x=3, then the numbers will be 3, 4, 5, 15, 23, 46. Only 3 and 15 are divisible by 3. Thus, 2 numbers.
If x=4, then the numbers will be 4, 5, 6, 18, 26, 52. Only 6 and 18 are divisible by 3. Thus, 2 numbers.
If x=5, then the numbers will be 5, 6, 7, 21, 29, 58. Only 6 and 21 are divisible by 3. Thus, 2 numbers.
If x=6, then the numbers will be 6, 7, 8, 24, 32, 64. Only 6 and 24 are divisible by 3. Thus, 2 numbers.
If x = 0, then the numbers are 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 16. Thus, 0 and 6 are divisible by 3, which is 2 numbers.
Hence, we observe in all examples we tested, there will always be 2 or 3 numbers.
