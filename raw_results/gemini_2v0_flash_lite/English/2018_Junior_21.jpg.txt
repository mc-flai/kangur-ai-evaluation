Reasoning: Let's analyze the conditions given in the question:
1.  The sum of the numbers is 2018.
2.  The product of the numbers is also 2018.
3.  One of the numbers is 2018.

Let the number of numbers on the board be *n*. Also, let *a1, a2, ..., an* be the numbers.
We are given:
*a1 + a2 + ... + an = 2018*
*a1 * a2 * ... * an = 2018*

Since one number is 2018, consider 2018 as one of the numbers. Assume there are *n* numbers. Let one of the numbers be 2018. Then a1=2018.
Therefore, we have:

2018 + a2 + a3 + ... + an = 2018
2018 * a2 * a3 * ... * an = 2018

From the sum equation:
a2 + a3 + ... + an = 0
Since the numbers are whole numbers, and their sum is 0, this implies all a2, a3, ...an should be equal to zero. However, from the product equation we can't have 0 values in the multiplication, since the result is 2018.

But 2018 = 2 * 1009, and 1009 is prime. So the factors of 2018 are 1, 2, 1009 and 2018.
Since we have 2018 as one of the numbers, we can rewrite the product as
2018 = 2018 * 1 * 1 * ... * 1

The sum would be 2018 + 1 + 1 + ... + 1. Let's say we have *n* numbers on the board.
If the product is 2018, we must have numbers 2018, 1, 1, ... 1 or 2, 1009 and some 1s to get the product.
The sum has to be 2018.  Consider the case with 2, 1009: Then we also need 1s.  If our numbers are: 2, 1009, 1, 1, 1,...1
Sum = 2 + 1009 + number of 1s = 2018
Number of 1s = 2018 - 1011 = 1007
The numbers are 2, 1009 and 1007 times 1.
Total numbers = 2 + 1007 = 1009
So we have 1009 numbers.
Since 2018 is one of them, we could also have 2, 1009, and 1007 1's.  The sum of all numbers will be 2+1009+1007 = 2018 and their product will be 2*1009*1*1*... = 2018.
Therefore the amount of numbers can be 1009. This is NOT in the list. However, we know there is a 2018. So we have the set {2018}.
If product is 2018, then the numbers could be 2, 1009 and 1's. The sum is 2018.
2 + 1009 + 1+...+1 = 2018, so 1007 1's are needed, and there will be 1009 such numbers.

If product is 2018. The the numbers could be 2018, 1, 1... so the sum will be 2018 + (n-1) and the product will be 2018
However the sum is 2018. Thus n = 1. 2018 is the only number,
The numbers are 2018.  The product is 2018, the sum is 2018.
Consider the numbers 2018, 1, 1.
Product = 2018
Sum = 2020.
So the correct answer should be 2018.

However,
the numbers could also be:
2, 1009, 1, 1, 1, ...
Sum is 2 + 1009 + number of 1s = 2018
Number of 1's = 1007.
Product = 2*1009 = 2018.
The numbers will be 2, 1009 and 1007 of the number 1. The number of these numbers is 1009

Consider 1, 1, 2018. Sum = 2020, Product 2018. Incorrect.
The sum is 2018, so the only option matching with the number 2018, which are 2018 numbers.
The set is just 2018. Sum is 2018, product is 2018.
The count of the numbers is one.

However since there are two constraints on the numbers,
sum = 2018, product = 2018.
One number is 2018.
2018 + x1 + ... + xn = 2018
2018 * x1 * ... xn = 2018
x1...xn = 1
x1 + x2 + ... xn = 0.
The numbers must be 2018, x1... xn.
So x1, .. xn must be 0 and 1.

Final Answer: C)
