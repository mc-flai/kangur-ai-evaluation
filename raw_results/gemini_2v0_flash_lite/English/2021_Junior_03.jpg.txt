Reasoning: The figure shows an equilateral triangle with three different paths from the top corner to the bottom right corner. Path P follows two sides of the smaller triangle. Path Q goes straight down and then straight across. Path R goes across then down. Since the triangle is equilateral the overall lengths of the sides are the same. Considering path P, the lengths is two-thirds of the side lengths. Q will be smaller than P because the hypotenuse is shorter than the sides. R is greater than P because it follows similar geometry and is closer to the full distance. The question is asking which path will be the longest and shortest. P < Q < R.

Answer: B) P<R<Q
