Reasoning:
The smallest triangle has a base of 1 unit and a height of 1 unit (relative to the grid). Its area is proportional to 1*1/2 = 1/2, so we can use 1.
The middle triangle has a base of 2 units and a height of 2 units. Its area is proportional to 2*2/2 = 2, so we can use 2.
The largest triangle has a base of 3 units and a height of 3 units. Its area is proportional to 3*3/2 = 9/2, so we can use 9.
Therefore, the ratio of the areas is 1:2:9.
