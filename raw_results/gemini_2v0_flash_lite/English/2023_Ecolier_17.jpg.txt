Reasoning: The train starts at B and stops at C as the first stop. The stops follow a pattern: B-C-D-E-F-E-D-C-B-A-B... This cycle repeats every 10 stops. To find the 46th stop, we can divide 46 by 10. The remainder will tell us which stop in the cycle the 46th stop corresponds to. 46 divided by 10 has a remainder of 6. The 6th stop in the cycle is F-E-D-C-B-A. The sixth stop in the cycle will be A.

Answer: A)
