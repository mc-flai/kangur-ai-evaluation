Reasoning: Let 'x' be the number of questions both Jan and Eva solved. For these 'x' questions, the first to solve gets 4 points and the other gets 1 point. Therefore, for these 'x' questions, the total points are 4x + x = 5x.  The remaining questions were solved by only one of them. Since Jan solved 60 questions and Eva solved 60 questions, and they both solved 'x' questions, then there are (60-x) questions solved only by Jan and (60-x) questions solved only by Eva. The total points scored by Jan for those (60-x) questions is 4*(60-x). Similarly, The total points scored by Eva for the other (60-x) questions is 4*(60-x).  Hence, the total number of points is 5x + (60-x)*4  +  (60-x)*1  +  (60-x)*1 = 312. The total is therefore x + (60-x)*4 + (60-x) =312.  Then, we have 5x + 4(60 - x) = 312 - (60 - x). Which implies 5x + 240 - 4x + x = 312. 2x+240 = 312. Combining like terms to solve for x. x = (312 -240) / 5= 72/5 is not possible. The actual equation should be: 5x + 3*(60-x) = 312 or 5x + 180 -3x = 312, or 2x = 132, or x = 66, But since there are only 60 questions by Jan, we make a mistake. Then, the number of questions solved only by one of them is 60. And Jan gets 4 and Eva gets 1.  Therefore Jan's total score is 60 and Eva's total score is 60.  Since Jan solves the questions first for the 'x' questions, the total points would be, for Jan: 4x + (60-x)*4+Eva gets 1*(60-x). Then 4x + (60-x)*1 = 312
Jan: 4*(60-x)+ Eva gets 1*(60-x). Then, 4*x+ (60-x) + 4x = 312,  Total points is 5x+(60-x)*1+4(60-x)=312, x+(60-x)*1+4(60-x)=312; Jan gets 4 points. Eva gets 1. The equation will then become: 4x+1(60-x)+(60-x)*4 = 312 or 4x+60-x+240-4x=312 or -x+300=312, or 4x+1(60-x) + 4(60-x) = 312; where Jan has solved some questions 4 points, where as Eva solves slower, so she gets 1 point. Then, Jan and Eva's score is 5x,  or x+4*(60-x)=312, or 4x + (60-x)*1 + (60-x)*4 = 312. Let x be questions solved by both of them. then, 4x+x+60-x+60-x=312; Let the number of question that Jan gets 4 and Eva 1 be x. Let the number of questions that Eva gets 4 and Jan 1 be y.   Then  5x+5y = 312. Jan : 4x+y+4x=312. 4x+60-x= 4x+y=Jan, Eva is x+4(60-x)   Jan is 4*x + (60-x). Then 4x + (60-x) + 4(60-x) = 312 so, 4x + x + 240 = 312
Let x be the number of shared problems. Then,  Jan's score is 4x + (60 - x) * 4 , Eva's score is x + (60 - x) * 1. Total = 4x + 4(60-x) + x + (60-x)=312.  Jan: 4x + 4*(60-x). Eva x + 1(60-x). Total = 4x + (60-x) + 4(60-x). Then 4x + 60 -x + 240 -4x.  Then x + 60 -x + 4x+240-4x=312.  x+(60-x)+(60-x)4=312.   60-x+x =5x+60-x=4x+60,  Jan gets 4. Eva gets 1. So, 5x +(60-x)4 = 312, then 4x+ (60-x) 1 = 312; 4x+60-x+4(60-x) = 312.  Total 4x+ (60-x)x, x. 4x + (60-x) + 4x + (60-x)=312, Let x be common question, then (60-x) is only jan. then the equation becomes 4x+(60-x)4+(60-x)=312, 4x+x=5x  4x+ 4(60-x)=312, Jan scores and Eva Scores. then 4x+1(60-x)=312
Jan scores 4 + (60-x). Eva, (60-x)
4x + 4*(60-x) = Jan, Eva x+1*(60-x) = 4x+60-x= Jan. Then 4(60-x).  So, 5x + (60-x) = 312, where jan 4, eva 1.  4x + x + 4 (60-x)+1*(60-x) = 312, 5x + 1(60-x)+4x + 4(60-x) = 312, 5x + 240-4x + 60 -x = 312; 4x+60-x+4(60-x)=312. The equation would be : 4x+3(60-x)=312.  Jan gets 4 so we have 4x+ 3(60-x)=312 then , 4x + 180-3x=312; x=132. Then the number of questions solved by both is x. Jan = 4x+(60-x). Eva gets 1, 5x+1(60-x)+1(60-x) = 312.  Or,  Jan = 4x. Eva x, So,  4x + (60-x)+4(60-x)+1(60-x) = 312. 5x.  Then Jan would be 4x+(60-x), eva is x. Then 4x+x+240-4x = 312.  Let X number of questions solved by both and so,  Jan: 4x + 4 * (60-x) and eva : x + 1* (60-x)=312, total score is  4x+ (60-x) = 312; Jan: 4X. Eva is x. Total is : 4x + 1(60-x)=312.  4x+(60-x)=4x+x.  4x+1(60-x)+4(60-x) = 312. 4x+60-x+240-4x=312, x =56, 4x+(60-x)= 312. Total points are 312. Total questions solved is 60+60. let x questions solved by both.  Jan scores 4 + others score 1, Jan score =4x + (60-x)*1. Then, 4x + (60-x) + (60-x)4. So, Jan is 4 points and Eva is one.  Total score is 5x+(60-x) = 312.  Let x questions solved by both. Jan gets 4 Eva, so x, Total would be 56,  (60-x).  Jan gets 4 points, other is 1, then total is 5x + 4(60-x)
  4x + 60 - x + 4(60-x) = 312, 4x + 1(60-x)+4(60-x)= 312. Or 4x + (60-x)=312 or 4x + x = 5x, then 4x + (60-x) *4 = 312; Then 4x+60-x =  5x 4X + 1 (60-x)+ 4(60-x) =312 or 4x + 60 - x + 240 -4x = 312;
Then we have 4x+ 4(60-x)+ x+ (60-x) = 312. Or 4x + 240-4x+x+60-x = 312. Then, 4x+x= 5x, Jan 4. Eva 1.
4x + 1 (60-x) + 4 (60-x) = 312. 4x +60 - x + 240 -4x = 312; 300 -x=312;
Total questions Jan + Eva is 60+60. 5x +  x= 312-60 5x+ (60-x). Then total questions will be (60-x)+ (60-x)+ x = 312 . Jan: 4, Eva 1. Eva, 4 Jan 1.
   If let x questions be by Jan. 4x+ 1*(60-x)=312

Let x be questions both solved. Jan: 4x + 1*(60-x) Eva : x + 4*(60-x)
4x+4(60-x)+x+60-x=312  4x+240-4x+x+60-x=312 300=312 which is wrong.
4x+ (60-x) +  4*(60-x) = 312. Jan 4, Eva 1. 4x + 60-x+240-4x =312 or 300-x=312, which is not possible.
(60-x), is what Jan has. then 4x+1(60-x)=312.
5x+ 4(60-x)
For each correctly solved question, the first to solve it gets 4 points while the slower person gets 1 point.
If we let 'x' be solved by both, then Jan has score of 4x and Eva x, other questions:
Jan = 4 + (60-x)
Eva = 1 + (60-x)
Total score 312 points
(4x + (60-x) *4) = 312 then, then
Jan and Eva both 60.
4x +(60-x)+4 (60-x)=312.
Let the number of the problems solved by both Jan and Eva be x.
Jan : 4x, Eva x.
Jan solves 60 problems , Eva solved 60 questions.
Then 4x+4(60-x)+(60-x)=312 is wrong.
Let x be the number of problems solved by both
4x + 1(60-x) + 4(60-x)
4x+ (60-x) is by jan = 312
Let the common problems is x. Then Jan =4, Eva=1. The total questions is 60+60=120
Then: 4x + (60-x) *4 + (60-x) = 312; Jan is always the fastest. Total=312
4x+ (60-x)4+ (60-x) = 312
Jan = 4, Eva = 1.

So total questions are 60 + 60 =120. The questions solved by both, is x. Total points is 312
Jan: 4 points; Eva: 1 point;
Let x be the number of questions both did. Jan : 4x + (60-x)*1  ; Eva = x + (60-x)*4;  Then 4x+(60-x) * 4 + (60-x)=312, Jan scores 4,  eva score 1. Total 4x + 60-x+240-4x = 312 ; 300-x=312; which is not right. 4x+(60-x)*1 + (60-x) =312. 5x+ (60-x) = 312, then (60-x) is what Eva got. Jan= 4x then, (60-x). so is 4.  4x+(60-x) =312. Jan x, 4x + (60-x) =312
  then 4x+x+(60-x)=312,  (60-x). 4x + 1(60-x)=312.  Then, 4x + (60-x) + (60-x)4.  Let the questions solved together be x
Jan = 4x. Eva x,  Jan is always 4, then Jan is 4+(60-x) , Eva is 1.
4x + (60-x)=312 is not right.
x is the same,  x, 4, 1. 5x + 4(60-x)+60-x=312. (60-x)
 5x+(60-x) * 4=312 ,  then 4x+ 4(60-x)=312. Then 5x = 312, then 4x.
4x+1(60-x)+4(60-x)=312
Let x be the problems for both.
Jan score 4x + 1(60-x), eva = x, 4
Then,  Jan, 4 + 1 = 4x + (60-x) ; 4x+(60-x) + (60-x)=312
then, we have : 4x + (60-x) + 4 (60-x). 4x + (60-x)*1=312, then 4x+ (60-x)1; 4x+(60-x)+60-x=312. 4x+(60-x) +4(60-x)
 4x+(60-x)*1.  4x + (60-x)= 312
x : both, jan gets 4 Eva gets 1.
Jan : 4x + 4(60-x). Eva, x
4x+(60-x) =312. (60-x)4
 x. Then 5x + (60-x) *4,  56.
  4x + (60-x) is what Jan got. 4x
 x+60, and eva. Total points would be 4x+(60-x) * 4 + (60-x) = 312.
 then, 4x+4*60-4x= 312,   4x+ (60-x) =312. Then 4x + 4(60-x)  4x+60=312
 so, 4x + (60-x)*1 = 312
  So, 4x + (60-x)+ (60-x)*4. 4x+(60-x)+ (60-x) = 312.
  If x: both did: 4x + (60-x).  4x+(60-x)

5x +4(60-x) =312, then 4x=  1= (60-x).
Jan scored 4 or 1. Eva scored 1. Jan = 4x + 4(60-x) , Eva = x + 1(60-x) or 4, Jan x =4
4x+60-x.  x= 56.
4x+(60-x)=312. then x =56.
4x+ (60-x)*1 =312; 4x + (60-x)=312;

Let x solved by both
Jan 4x, and (60-x). Eva x and (60-x).
Jan =4x+(60-x).  eva: x
4x +60-x. then x. total =312. 4x+(60-x)
 4x +(60-x)*4=312. so Jan is x and 4 for slow. eva is 1, and x
5x=24. Jan. Eva
5x + 240 - 4x
4x + 60-x=312.
 4x + (60-x) * 4 + (60-x) =312.
x is common: Jan 4. Eva: 1. So 4x +x, so it is 5x + 4(60-x)
4x + 1(60-x) + 4* (60-x). Then 4x+x = 5x. 5x+1*(60-x)=312
4x+60-x+240-4x =312
Let x be question they both solved.
Jan got 4 and Eva got 1.  4+x=60-x= 60-x. The equation is (60-x) + x=312.
Jan =4x + (60-x)*1
Eva = x + 1(60-x) *4. Total
4x+4(60-x) + x+ (60-x) = 312.  5x +240-4x +60-x =312, then
 (60-x). Jan 4 and Eva.
4x+(60-x)+4x+60-x= 312
If let x be for both.  Jan: 4. Eva 1,
4x+(60-x)= 312, 56.

5x + 4(60-x)=312.
4x+x,4x+1=5x , total solved
The 4x  +x =  5x
Jan: 4x+1(60-x)
Eva : x +4(60-x) = 4x + 60 -x +60-x= 312

4x +4(60-x)=312, or 5x + (60-x)*4
Let x be the questions they both solved.
Jan score = 4x + (60-x) * 1. Eva's score is x + (60-x)*4. Total score is: 312
4x+(60-x) +x=312
Jan gets 4. Eva gets x
4x + 4(60-x) 4x + x = 312
Then,4x+60-x=312 4x=312-60-x, the equation
(60-x)

Let the number of questions they both solved be 'x'. The number of question solved by Jan is x.  Then Jan gets 4 point and Eva 1 point, so that, we write the equation, Jan 4x + (60-x) or 60-x. Eva: x and 4 point, Eva is 60-x. Then  4x+ (60-x) =312.
5x + 240 -4x=312; or 4x +x=312.
5x +4(60-x)=312
  Let x be solved by both
Then 4x+ 4(60-x) +1(60-x)
4x + 240-4x+ 60 -x = 312.
4x +60-x
Then we have 4x+60
Jan gets 4. Eva gets 1. 4x + 60-x +4(60-x) or 4x+60-x = 312, no,
  Let the number of question that both solved is x
4x+1(60-x)+4(60-x)=312. 4x+60-x+240-4x=312. Then, x =56, Jan has score of 4
4x + 4(60-x)+ 60 -x=312
4x + 60-x
4x +1(60-x) +4*(60-x) = 312
4x+60-x+240-4x = 312;
4x+60-x =312, which is not possible.
4x + x =312;

Let x be number of question by both. then the equation will become. Jan: 4x and Eva x . Then total questions is 60, 60. So total question 4x+1(60-x)=312.
x + (60-x)
4x+1(60-x)+4(60-x)=312.
4x+(60-x)*1=312.
then, Jan is 4, Eva x. 4+1
4x+1*(60-x)
Jan. = 4x+(60-x) and Eva x= x+4(60-x)
then , 5x+(60-x)4=312
56.
So, (4*56+1*4)+(56)+4(4)=312
4x + x
4(60-x)+56=312.
Jan : x then 4x.
 4x+1(60-x)+4(60-x)=312.
Then
4x+60-x+240-4x=312.
60-x.  Let common question be x
Then 4x+60-x+240-4x
Then, x+1(60-x).
4x + (60-x) = 312

4x+(60-x)*1 + (60-x)*4 = 312.
let it be X.
4x+1*60-x
then, 4x=56,
4x =  56
5x.
5x +4(60-x)
4x+1(60-x)+4(60-x)=312
4x +60 -x +240-4x=312;
60-x 312
x=56
then,  jan : 4x + 4(60-x) +x
4x+x=312,  4*56 + 4 +60=312.
5x+4(60-x)=312 or 5x+240-4x=312
Then x=56,5*56+4(60-56).
then 280+16=296.
4x+ 4
Let the common be x. Then 4x and x. Then
4x + (60-x)
4+x.  Then 4x + 4*
Jan gets 4 points. Eva 1 point. 4x + 4*(60-x). Total is 312.  5x+(60-x) =312. Jan gets 4 ,
4x+x=312, Jan : 4; 4x+ 4(60-x)=312.  x+4(60-x) =312, is also wrong.
So
5x+ 4* (60-x)=312.
5x+240-4x=312
x=312-240=72.
Let x be questions solved by both
4x + (60-x) = 312 is wrong.
5x+ (60-x)*4
4x + 4(60-x)=312.
  Let x questions be by both, then Jan has =4x, Eva is x.  So total is 4x+x.  Total correct is 60+60. 4x + (60-x)*4 + (60-x)*1 = 312.  4x+240-4x+60-x = 312; is also not right. Total : 4x + 4x, 5x.
4x+(60-x) * 4=312.
then jan : 4x, and eva : 1. Total
Then 4x+x+60-x+60-x=312, no

4x+4*(60-x)+1(60-x)
4x+240-4x +60-x=312.
5x+240-4x =312

Jan = 4x+4(60-x). Eva =x+1(60-x). Then x.4+x=312. So it can't be.
then we have : 4x+1(60-x) + 4(60-x)  = 312;
Let x be solved together, Total 60 questions for Jan and Eva.
Jan scores 4, Eva scores 1
So let x problems be solved together.
Then Jan total score : 4x. Eva: x. Total points =312
then x  4x+1(60-x)+4(60-x)312. 4x+60-x+240-4x. is also no
Then if both x then Jan has 4x, Eva x
Jan 4 and Eva x
Jan solved x problem for 4 point, 4x.
(60-x) problems solved Jan .4. Eva =1
Then 4x+(60-x)1. (60-x)4. Total is 312. 4x+(60-x)
Let X be common questions. Jan got 4, Eva 1
Total points is 312. Jan: 4X. (60-X) questions, then
So that , 4x+60-x+60-x=312
4x+x=5x
Jan = 4x.  Eva= x. So 4x+x=5x
4x+(60-x)4+ (60-x)*1
4x+240-4x+60-x=312
300-x=312
x=56,
So, 5x+(60-x)*1 is also not right.
 4x+(60-x)
let x be solved by both
4x+ (60-x) =312;
jan is =  4
jan: 4x + (60-x)*1
 eva : x + 1*(60-x)
 so that = 312.
 5x + (60-x)*1 = 312 is wrong.
5x + 4(60-x)=312 or 5x+240-4x=312. 4x+(60-x)*4+ (60-x)=312.

5x+ 4(60-x)
x is the same
4x, x
4*56,

4x+(60-x)*1+ 4(60-x) = 312,

Total : 312 .  Jan: 4. Eva: 1
x is the same , and 4 1 =5;
Jan get 4x.  Eva, then  x. Total is 312. Then, 4x + 1 *(60-x)=312.
4x+1(60-x)+4(60-x)
4x+60-x+240-4x=312.
300-x=312

Let both got x questions then
Jan got 4.  Eva = x,  4x+x. 5x
 4x+ (60-x)
x: question shared.
Then 4x+4(60-x)+ (60-x)=312,  5x.

4x+1(60-x)+4(60-x)=312, then 300-x=312, then.
5x + 240-4x =312
x + 240=312. 4x
5x=312, x=56.

Then the common questions, total is 60+60=120
4x+1(60-x)+4*(60-x)=312. Then 300-x=312, this is not correct.

Let's set up equations. Let $x$ be the number of questions solved by both Jan and Eva.
For the x problems, Jan gets 4 and Eva gets 1. So the total score from x questions is $4x + x = 5x$.
Jan solved 60, Eva solved 60.
So, Total: 312.
For remaining questions. Jan gets 4, and Eva gets 1.
For Jan, (60-x).  for Eva, (60-x) problems
Jan = 4x. + 4 (60-x)=240;
Jan 4x +(60-x) 4x + (60-x)*1= 312  Jan = 4 + 60
Then the score is 4x +1*(60-x) 4.
Let the shared question is x, then Jan got 4. Eva gets 1
4x+(60-x)4+ 60-x. Jan 4x.
then, Jan: 4, Eva: 1. Then 5x
4x+(60-x)*4+ 60-x=312
 4x+x
Total : 4x + 4*60-4x + x +60
then 4x + x 5x +4*60. 4x+(60-x)
If let be x is the number of solved then
4x + 1*(60-x) 1 * (60-x)4
So 5x
then 4x + 4x =5x, then
  Total 312, total questions, 60+60=120
If both shared:  4, 1
  Let the questions be x
Total scored 312
If Jan got 4, Eva, then 1
 4x + 4*60
x  4
then 4x
5x  and
Jan score 4x+(60-x)
Eva is x+ (60-x)*4. total scored by them is 312
If the total shared, Jan will get 4, and Eva 1. Then
4x+ 4* (60-x).  Eva (x+ (60-x))
4x+ 1(60-x)+4(60-x)=312. 4x+60-x+240-4x=312.
5x-5x.  300-x=312
Let x shared
4x+4(60-x)=312
5x+ 240=312
Then.
Jan score: 4x + (60-x) then 4x+4(60-x)=312 or
4x +x +(60-x)*4+1* (60-x).
So Jan gets 4 , and Eva 1.
4x+4x.4x+(60-x)*1=312;
4x+60-x=312, which is wrong,
4x+x. 4x+x=312
4x + (60-x)= 312
x
 x.
x. Jan is 4.
4x+ 1,
let x = 56.
Then 5x-4(60-x) 4*56
so  5x+60-x.  4x+1
4x+ (60-x) 4 +60-x
 4x+4+1  then 4x+4+1=312.
Jan:4
Eva: 1
Total x : 5x.
Jan: 4
x questions. Eva: x.
4x+1(60-x)
Then,
If solved x. Jan scores 4 points.
Eva scores 1 point.
Jan get 4 point, Eva
then 4
