Reasoning: Yvonne states she has more stars than planets. Let's examine the options. Option A has 3 planets, 3 stars and 3 moons. This does not satisfy Yvonne's condition. Option B has 2 planets and 3 stars, which satisfies Yvonne's condition. Option C has 3 planets, 1 star and 2 moons, which does not satisfy Yvonne's condition. Option D has 1 planet, 3 stars and 2 moons, satisfying the conditions of Yvonne. Option E has 2 planets, 3 stars and 2 moons, satisfying the conditions of Yvonne. Since the problem only has one correct answer, we have to check against the other statements. Xenia has an even number of pins so, we eliminate A and D. Zach says half his pins are planets, which means the number of pins is even. The condition is not met by E so B is the only choice to fulfill all the statements.

Answer: B)
