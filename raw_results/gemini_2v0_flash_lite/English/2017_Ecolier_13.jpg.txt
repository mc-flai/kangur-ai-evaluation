Reasoning: First, we need to find the total number of children who registered. 13 + 19 = 32. Then, we need to divide the total number of children by the number of teams, 32 / 6 = 5 with a remainder of 2. This means there needs to be a total of 6 teams with the same number of children, which is 6 teams * 6 children = 36 children total. Finally, to determine how many more children are needed, we subtract the current total from the desired total, 36 - 32 = 4.
