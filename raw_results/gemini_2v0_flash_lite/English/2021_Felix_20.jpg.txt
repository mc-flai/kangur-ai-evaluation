Reasoning: The small cog (pink) rotates clockwise. Since the cogs are meshed, the large cog (blue) will rotate counter-clockwise. After the small cog makes one full turn, the black tooth on the small cog will be back in its original position. The black tooth on the large cog will have moved one tooth position over. Option B shows the large cog's black tooth moved one tooth position counter-clockwise.

Answer: B)
