Reasoning:
1.  Count the black squares: There are 5 fully black squares.
2.  Count the white squares: There are 4 fully white squares.
3.  Analyze the triangles: There are two triangles where half of the square is black and half white, so these can be considered 1 black square + 1 white square.
4.  Considering the triangles, the total is now 5 + 1 = 6 black and 4 + 1 = 5 white.
5.  To make the black and white areas equal we need to add 1 white square, and we should replace the question mark with an answer that adds a white square.
6. We should also remove a black square.
7. The question mark is located in a place that is a white triangle, so we are searching for a shape that would make it a half-white square or equal to half the size of the black area.
8. Considering our options, D provides a square containing a black triangle and a white triangle which provides equal amounts.
9.  By replacing the question mark with a black square (E), the black will become equal to the white.

Answer: D)
