Reasoning:
The figure is made up of 1 square and 8 rectangles. All parts have a width of 8 cm. When assembled into a single 8 cm wide rectangle, the length can be found by considering the total length of the figure.
We can analyze the figure to find the length of the rectangle:
There is one square and there are eight rectangles of 8cm width each. We can sum up each segment of the rectangles to find the length. The length of the square is 8cm as well. There are 2 vertical and 2 horizontal lengths. Therefore, we can sum each length together.
1st length = 8cm*2 + 8cm*2 + 8cm*2 + 8cm*2 + 8cm = 168cm

Answer: B)
