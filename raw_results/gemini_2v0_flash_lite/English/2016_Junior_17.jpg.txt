Reasoning: The question asks for the minimum number of colors needed to color a 3x3 square such that each row, column, and diagonal has three different colors. A classic solution involves using 3 colors in a pattern. For example, one possible configuration uses three colours in a repeating pattern.

1 2 3
2 3 1
3 1 2

In this pattern, each row, column, and diagonal has the numbers 1, 2, and 3 which represent the three colors.
