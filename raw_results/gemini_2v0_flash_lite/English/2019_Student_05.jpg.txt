Reasoning: A pyramid with 'n' triangular faces has a base that is an 'n'-sided polygon. The pyramid has 'n' edges on the base and 'n' edges connecting the base vertices to the apex.  Since there are 23 triangular faces, the base is a 23-sided polygon. Therefore, it has 23 edges on the base and 23 edges connecting the apex. In addition, it has 1 face for the base. So, in total, it has 23 * 2 = 46 edges.

Answer: C)
