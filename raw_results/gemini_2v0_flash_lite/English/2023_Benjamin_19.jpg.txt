Reasoning:
The "Ziel" is two positions away from the starting point.
*   Beaver: Reaches "Ziel" in 2 jumps.
*   Rabbit: Reaches "Ziel" in 1 jump.
*   Kangaroo: Does not reach "Ziel" in 1 jump, but reaches it in 1 jump if the circular track goes back to the start.

The rabbit reaches the target in the fewest jumps.
