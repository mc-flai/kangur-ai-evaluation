Reasoning: A cube has 12 edges. A cube with side length 1 has each edge of length 1. The wire pieces available are 1 cm, 2 cm, 3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm, 6 cm, and 7 cm. To minimize the number of pieces used, we want to use longer pieces as much as possible. We can use the 7cm wire piece to form 7 edges of the cube which leaves 5 edges remaining. We can't use the 6 cm wire piece as it would result in an edge overlapping. We can use the 5 cm wire piece to form 5 edges which leaves 0 edges remaining. Then we can use the wire pieces of length 1cm,1cm,1cm,1cm and 1cm and use only 5 wire pieces. However, we can take wire pieces of length 1 cm for the sides. Hence we have 12 pieces. Now, let us examine the possibilities using only the 1 cm long piece.  We need 12 edges x 1 cm/edge = 12 cm of wire. We have enough 1 cm pieces. Therefore, the smallest number of wire pieces is 12 (using 1 cm pieces), which is not among the options, so this is not correct.

Each edge of the cube must be of length 1. There are 12 edges on a cube.
*   We could use the 1 cm piece for all 12 edges, but this contradicts the question which does not have 12 edges among the given options.
*   Another option:
    *   We could use 2 of the 6cm wires, so we have 12 edges.
    *   We can use some 2 of the 7cm wires but this is not optimal since 7 + 7 = 14
    *   The best way: we use the 1 cm wire, which is optimal if there is no other wire with a larger sum length of edges to use.

We can form 12 edges of length 1 cm by taking 12 wire pieces. However the answer choices don't include that.

The lengths of wire are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Number of edges of the cube = 12.
The minimum total length should be 12.

If we take
7+5 = 12; the smallest number of wire pieces is 2.

If we take 6+6; smallest number of wire pieces is 2.

If we take,
4+3+5 = 12 and has 3 wire pieces.

If we take,
1+2+3+6 =12, total number of wire pieces = 4.
If we take
1+3+4+4 = 12 and has 4 wire pieces.
So,
12 = 4+4+4 has 3 pieces.
12= 4+3+5

1+2+3+6
1+2+4+5
1+3+4+4
2+3+3+4

Let's try using only the 1cm wire, we would need 12 pieces.  Since the options do not have 12.
If we could use the 2 cm piece, it would require 6 pieces
If we could use the 3cm pieces, then we can use 4 pieces of length 3 each.
The minimum number is 4.

If we take lengths 4, 4, 4, then we need three pieces.

Reasoning: A cube has 12 edges, each of length 1. The available wire lengths are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. To minimize the number of wire pieces, we want to use the longest available wires as much as possible. We need to use lengths that add up to a total of 12.  We can use the 7 cm wire.  We have 12 edge lengths, and each side is of length 1, we need a total of 12 units length,
If we use one 7 cm wire, the remainder we can use is 5. we can use the 5cm wire.
that would use two pieces.
If we use two 6 cm wires, we can use 2 pieces.
Let us say, 4 cm, 4 cm, and 4 cm, then we have three wire pieces.
3+5+4.

4+4+4, so three wire pieces.
5+7 = 12, requires 2 pieces.
6+6, requires 2 pieces.

If we chose 4 wire pieces, we have 1+2+3+6 =12, so total pieces =4.
If we choose 3 wire pieces, we can take 4,4,4.
4+4+4.
If we take, 1+2+3+6, has 4 pieces.
