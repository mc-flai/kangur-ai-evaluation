Reasoning:
1.  Analyze the shapes provided: a square (2x2) and a trapezoid (4x2).
2.  Analyze the paper boat: The boat is made of 2 parts: rectangle (2x4) and trapezoid(4x2), and another rectangle (2x2) on top
3.  The paper boat contains 10 squares and 2 trapezoids.
4.  We can use square to cover square shape and trapezoid to cover trapezoid shape.
5.  The two trapezoids require 2 trapezoids, the rest square shapes require 4 squares (10 - 8 = 2 squares for squares and 2 for trapezoids).
6. Total: 1 trapezoid + 1 trapezoid + 4 squares = 6 shapes

Answer: A)
