Reasoning:
In a cube, the opposite faces of the given paper net can be determined by visualizing the folding process.  The number 3 is adjacent to numbers 2, 4, and 5. The opposite face of 3 should not be adjacent. By observing the net, it is seen that 6 is opposite to 4, 2 is opposite 5, and 3 is opposite 1. Therefore, the face opposite to the face with the number 3 is the face with the number 1.

Answer: A)
