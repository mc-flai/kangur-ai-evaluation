Reasoning: Let the total distance be D. David covered 3/4 of the distance, so the distance covered in the first part is (3/4)D.  The remaining distance is D - (3/4)D = (1/4)D. The time for the whole journey is T. The time already passed when David changed the speed is (2/3)T.  The remaining time is T - (2/3)T = (1/3)T.
Speed in the first part = (distance)/(time) = ((3/4)D)/((2/3)T) = (9/8)(D/T).
Speed in the second part = ((1/4)D)/((1/3)T) = (3/4)(D/T).
Ratio of speeds = (9/8)(D/T) : (3/4)(D/T) = 9/8 : 6/8 = 9:6 = 3:2.
