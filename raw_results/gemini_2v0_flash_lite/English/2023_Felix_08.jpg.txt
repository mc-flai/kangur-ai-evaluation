Reasoning: We need to determine how many faces of the cubes touch each other in the figure. We can analyze the figure by counting the pairs of cubes touching each other:
- Vertical column on the left has 2 glue spots.
- Middle horizontal has 3 glue spots.
- The right vertical column has 2 glue spots.
- the bottom middle is two pieces glued together has 1 glue spot.
- Top horizontal piece has 2 glue spots.
Therefore, a total of 2+3+2+1+2=10 glue drops are needed.
