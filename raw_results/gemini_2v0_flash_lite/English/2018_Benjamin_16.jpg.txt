Reasoning: Let's analyze the possible combinations for Monika and Daniel:
Monika's sum is 8. Possible combinations of 3 numbers: 1+2+5, 1+3+4.
Daniel's sum is 7. Possible combinations of 3 numbers: 1+2+4.
Comparing Monika's and Daniel's combinations, we see there are no common numbers in the different combinations. The possible sets are:
Monika: {1, 2, 5} or {1, 3, 4}
Daniel: {1, 2, 4}
They can have the same numbers, like 1, 2, or 4, but they can not be the same combination. For instance, 1, 2, and 4 sum to 7, which Daniel chose, but their sum is 7 and not 8 as Monika chose. Thus, one can conclude they do not share any common numbers between the chosen sets.

Answer: A)
