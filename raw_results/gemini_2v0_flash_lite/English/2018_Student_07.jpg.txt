Reasoning: A regular octagon has interior angles of 135 degrees. Two squares and four rhombuses combine to form this octagon. The vertices where the rhombus and squares meet must be the same angle. At each of these vertices, the rhombus angle and the square angles (90 degrees each) meet. So each obtuse angle of the rhombus must be 360 - 90 - 90 - x = 135. Solving for x, we get x = 150 degrees.

Answer: E)
