Reasoning: The current reading is 91.876. We want to find the minimum amount of water to be used so that the digits are all different again. This requires that we look for the next possible reading, avoiding repeated digits. The next smallest possible value, where all digits are different, would be 92.034. We need to calculate the difference between 92.034 and 91.876 to figure out how much water must be used. However the options are only about the decimal portion of the value. The existing meter reading has a 9, 1, 8, 7 and 6. The next available digits for each position are 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5. We want to see how much water must be used to arrive at the next reading, the value with all digits different. The smallest increment to achieve a unique digit after .876 would be to 9.034. Thus the difference would be from .876 to the next number with all different digits, which is to make the next digit in the tenth position to be the next non-duplicate number, which would be 9.  Thus if we increment to 9, the digits would be 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5, but from what we have already, which is .876. So, we must increment from .876 to .034, which means that we would have to increment the 9 to a new value which has digits which are all non-duplicative, and the closest is 92.034. Thus the difference between 92.034 and 91.876 is 0.158, but this does not exist in the given answers.  We increment to 91.902. The existing digits are 9, 1, 8, 7, and 6. Next possible unique digit is 0.902. The correct next decimal sequence should involve 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  If we have .876, the next non-duplicate sequence must be .902. Therefore to get from 91.876 to 91.902 we must use an additional 0.026m3. Now, by going to the next unique sequence, the next minimum amount would be from .876 to .902. This will be 0.026 which is not found here. Let's try the answer choices. We want a number that would change the digits on the meter to have all different digits.
If we add 0.006, we get 91.882.
If we add 0.034, we get 91.910.
If we add 0.086, we get 91.962.
If we add 0.137, we get 92.013.
If we add 1.048, we get 92.924, this is not possible.
The difference must change all the digits. Then adding 0.137 will make all digits different.
