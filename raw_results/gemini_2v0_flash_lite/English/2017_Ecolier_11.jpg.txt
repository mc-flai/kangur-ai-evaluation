Reasoning: To minimize the number of packages, Marius should buy as many packages of 25 as possible. He can buy two packages of 25 (2 * 25 = 50 balloons). Then, he needs 20 more balloons, which he can get by buying two packages of 10 (2 * 10 = 20 balloons). This gives a total of 2 packages of 25 and 2 packages of 10.  This is a total of 2 + 2 = 4 packages. Let's consider other options:
*   If we start with one package of 25, we need 45 more balloons. We could take 4 packages of 10 and one package of 5.  This will give us 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 packages
*   If we start with no packages of 25. Then we need 70 balloons. 7 packages of 10 would do the trick. or 14 packages of 5, for example, or 7 packages of 10.
*   The combination that uses the fewest packages is 2 packages of 25 and 2 packages of 10 giving us 70 balloons.
