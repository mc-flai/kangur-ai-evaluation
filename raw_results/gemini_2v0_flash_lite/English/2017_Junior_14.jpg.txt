Reasoning: Let the three consecutive positive whole numbers be x-1, x, and x+1. Their squares are (x-1)^2, x^2, and (x+1)^2. The sum of the squares is given as 770. Thus, (x-1)^2 + x^2 + (x+1)^2 = 770. Expanding, we get x^2 - 2x + 1 + x^2 + x^2 + 2x + 1 = 770, which simplifies to 3x^2 + 2 = 770. Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get 3x^2 = 768. Dividing by 3, we get x^2 = 256. Taking the square root of both sides, we get x = 16 (since x is positive). The three consecutive numbers are then 15, 16, and 17. The largest number is 17.
