Reasoning:
The problem states that the sum of the numbers around each bold point is the same. We can see one bold point that connects 6, 4, and the missing number (let's call it x). Also, there is another bold point that connects 6, x, and 11.  Therefore, 6 + 4 + x = 6 + x + 11, which simplifies to 10 + x = 17 + x, making it impossible since the x cancels itself and we end up with 10 = 17. This indicates a problem with this approach. Let's try another approach. We know that the numbers 1 through 11 must be used. The sum of the numbers is: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11 = 66. From one bold point we have the sum 6 + 4 + ? We can get the sum from the other bold point 11+?+6.
From the diagram, let us call the unknown number 'x'. We can see three "spokes" coming from the bold points. If we look at the top right bold point, we have the sum 6+x+11=17+x. The other bold point has the sum 4+6+x=10+x. Since all the sums are equal, then we have the sum from both the bold points must equal. Therefore, the sum of each of the three groups of numbers that share a bold point must be equal. The first is 4+6+X. The sum of the 11 numbers are 1 through 11 = 66.
From the diagram, we see that 6, 4, and the unknown number x are connected at the top left vertex. Also, the numbers 6, 11, and x are connected at the top right vertex. Therefore, we can write two equations based on these two vertices.
The sum of the first group is 6+4+x=10+x
The sum of the second group is 6+11+x = 17+x
Since the sums of the numbers on the connecting points must be equal, then we can infer that:
6+4+x=6+x+11.
Since the numbers on the same bold points are equal, we can infer that the sums from 10+x and 17+x must be different. There is an error in the question.
Let's add all numbers and find the value
6+4+x = 11+x+y (let y be the middle hexagon).
11+x+y = 17+x
10+x = 17+x
4+x+y=17+x
4+x+y = 10+x
This approach still isn't working.
Let's see if we can find another connection and simplify.
The missing number and 6 are at the top and are also connected at the middle node of the first horizontal row. 4 and 11 are connected to a node in the second row.
Let's try an intuitive approach by looking at the answers and determining which one would work.
We need to sum the rows.
6+4+?
?+11+...
6+11+...
If we assume the missing number is 5, the sums would become.
6+4+5 = 15
5+11+...
6+11 = 17, which means 17+... must be 15, which is wrong.
Let's assume the answer is 7:
6+4+7=17.
7+11+...
6+11=17, so the other one must be 7+11=17. The numbers used are: 6,4,7,11
Let's make the sums of the values 1 through 11 equal at each bold point.
If the number is 5, we have 6+4+5=15. Then, 11+6 = 17. So the sum is 15.
Let's try an approach where we determine the bold point has the same sum.
Assume ? = 7.
6+4+7=17
6+11+?=17
17 = 17
4+? = 17
Then it cannot be 7.
If the sum for all connections are the same:
6+4+? = ?+6+11.
6+4=10
6+11=17
Then let the number in the ? be 'x'.
If x=7, then we have,
6+4+7=17
6+11+y, we also have x=7
So if x=7
6+4+7=17
7+11=18
The missing number is 5.
