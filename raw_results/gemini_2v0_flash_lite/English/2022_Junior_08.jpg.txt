Reasoning: The instructions state that this week the user spent half the amount of time using two of the apps and the same amount of time using the other two apps. Observing the original diagram, we can determine the relative lengths of each bar, and then determine which answer choice satisfies the problem condition. The shortest bar should have length 1, the second shortest bar should have length 2, the third shortest bar should have length 3, and the longest bar should have length 4. If two apps are halved, then they should have lengths of 2 and 1. The other two apps should remain at 3 and 4. Examining the answer choices, only (B) satisfies the condition.

Answer: B)
