Reasoning: The question asks for the minimum number of trays needed to make the plate. Let's analyze the tray of cookies and the plate of cookies. The tray contains 1 star of each color, 1 triangle of each color, 1 moon, 1 heart, and 1 cookie of each color.
The plate has: 4 stars, 2 triangles, 2 moons, and 2 hearts.

To form the required number of each kind of cookies, we can evaluate how many trays are needed for each shape:
- Stars: 4 stars are needed. One tray has 2 stars. Hence, we need 2 trays.
- Triangles: 2 triangles are needed. One tray has 2 triangles. Hence, we need 1 tray.
- Moons: 2 moons are needed. One tray has 1 moon. Hence, we need 2 trays.
- Hearts: 2 hearts are needed. One tray has 1 heart. Hence, we need 2 trays.

In the end, we need 2 trays of cookies to have enough stars, 2 moons, and hearts. With these trays we'll also have 2 triangles.

Answer: (B)
