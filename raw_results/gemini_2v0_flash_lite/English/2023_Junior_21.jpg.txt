Reasoning: The sum of three adjacent numbers must be a multiple of 3. The numbers 3 and 1 are already placed. Let's look at the structure of the squares: _ _ _ 3 1 _ _ _ _.  Let's call the blank spaces A, B, C, D, E, and F. Since adjacent sums must be a multiple of 3, we know that A + B + 3 must be a multiple of 3, B + C + 3 is also a multiple of 3.  Also, C + 3 + 1 is a multiple of 3, meaning that C + 4 must be a multiple of 3.  Similarly, D + 1 + E must be a multiple of 3, and E + F + _ must be a multiple of 3, where the last blank is the number that needs to be placed. We also know that any number placed in the blank must be between 1 and 9, excluding 3 and 1, and that they each appear once.
From the condition C+4 is a multiple of 3, we can infer that C can only take values 2, 5, 8.
Case 1: C=2, then A+B needs to be a multiple of 3 since A+B+3 is a multiple of 3.  Therefore we can choose from {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, and the sum is 2.  Then B is the complement of A.
If C = 2, then A+B can be {6, 9, 12, 15}.  We know that we can arrange numbers to form multiple of 3. This configuration can yield 2. If we follow the previous format, we can also make sure D+1+E and E+F+X, etc, is a multiple of 3, where X is a number among the 3 remaining blanks. The numbers are 2, 5, 8, and we can choose one of them.  For C = 2, {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} - {2, 5, 8} = {4, 6, 7, 9}.  It gives us 2 * 2 * 2 + 2 * 2.  The number of possibilities is 2*2*2 = 8 in this case.
When C = 5 or C = 8, we will have same reasoning.
So, we can have 2 cases where we can choose (2, 5, 8).  There are 3! or 6 ways to arrange these 3 numbers in the positions, as they can only be 2, 5, or 8, giving us 2.  Then the remaining numbers can be 4, 6, 7, and 9 and we can arrange them such that they are a multiple of 3, it will take 2 * 2.
Therefore total = 3* 2 + 2 * 3 = 12
Then we can fill in 3 blank places.

Let's re-evaluate the options. We have the numbers 1, 3, and then the pattern is three numbers must add to a multiple of 3. Since 3 + 1 is 4. So we need to place the remaining numbers 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 such that each group of 3 sums to a multiple of 3. The groups are _ _ _ 3 1 _ _ _ _. So 2,5,8 must be placed next to the 1, 3 or in the next group. C must be 2, 5, or 8. Let's consider C = 2.  Then we have 4, 6, 7, 9 to be placed.
The possibilities are 12.

Answer: (E)
