Reasoning: Let's solve the hiking problem. The distances form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2 km. Let the distance on Monday be 'x'. The distances for each day are: Monday (x), Tuesday (x+2), Wednesday (x+4), Thursday (x+6), Friday (x+8). The total distance is 70 km. So, x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 70. This simplifies to 5x + 20 = 70.  Subtracting 20 from both sides gives 5x = 50. Dividing by 5 gives x = 10. Therefore: Monday is 10 km, Tuesday is 12 km, Wednesday is 14 km, Thursday is 16 km, and Friday is 18 km. The question asks for the distance on Thursday, which is x+6 = 10 + 6 = 16 km.
