Reasoning: The square flowerbed has sides of length 12 m. The diagram shows the flowerbed is divided into four rectangles. Each rectangle has one side of length 4 m. The total area of the flowerbed is 12m * 12m = 144 m². The diagram shows that the area where sunflowers are planted is one full rectangle of 4m x 4m.  Thus, the sunflower area is equal to 4m * 4m = 16 m². However, the question asks for the total area where sunflowers are planted, which is the same as one complete rectangular area, so 12*4 = 48m²

Answer: E)
