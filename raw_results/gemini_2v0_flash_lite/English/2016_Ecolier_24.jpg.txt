Reasoning:
Initially, the sparrows are looking in the same direction. Azra whistles 4 times because she sees 4 other sparrows. Bernhard whistles 3 times, Christa whistles 2 times, David whistles 1 time, and Elsa whistles 0 times. The total number of whistles is 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 10.

The total number of whistles needs to be greater than 10 after a single sparrow turns around. Let's test each sparrow:
*   If Azra turns around, she sees 0 sparrows and whistles 0 times. Bernhard, Christa, David, and Elsa see 3, 2, 1, and 0, respectively. Total: 0 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 6 (too low).
*   If Bernhard turns around, Azra whistles 4 times. Bernhard whistles 0 times. Christa, David, and Elsa see 2, 1, and 0. Total: 4 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 7 (too low).
*   If Christa turns around, Azra and Bernhard whistle 4 and 3 times respectively. Christa whistles 0 times. David and Elsa see 0 and 0 times. Total: 4 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 7 (too low).
*   If David turns around, Azra, Bernhard, and Christa whistle 4, 3, and 2 times respectively. David whistles 0 times. Elsa whistles 0 times. Total: 4 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 9 (too low).
*   If Elsa turns around, Azra, Bernhard, Christa, and David whistle 4, 3, 2, and 1 times, respectively. Elsa sees 0 sparrows and whistles 0 times. Total = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 10 (equal to first situation, the question says it must be more).

Let's think again. If Elsa turns around, she now looks at David. Let's consider Elsa.
Before: Azra 4, Bernhard 3, Christa 2, David 1, Elsa 0. Total = 10.
Elsa turns.
Azra looks at 4, whistles 4. Bernhard looks at 3, whistles 3. Christa looks at 2, whistles 2. David looks at 1, whistles 1. Elsa looks at 0, whistles 0. Total = 10
The problem states that the total whistling count in the second situation has to be more than 10. We might need to reconsider the question.
If David turns around, then from left: Azra 4, Bernhard 3, Christa 2, David 0, Elsa 0. Total = 9.
If Christa turns, Azra 4, Bernhard 3, Christa 0, David 1, Elsa 0. Total = 8
If Bernhard turns: Azra 4, Bernhard 0, Christa 2, David 1, Elsa 0. Total = 7.
If Azra turns: Azra 0, Bernhard 3, Christa 2, David 1, Elsa 0. Total = 6.
There seems to be a slight problem. Since we cannot choose a greater number of whistles. However, the number of sparrows each bird is seeing depends on direction, and the question might assume that the birds are looking at the others on their left.
Azra 4
Bernhard 3
Christa 2
David 1
Elsa 0
Total 10
If Elsa turns, then
Azra 4
Bernhard 3
Christa 2
David 1
Elsa 0
Total 10

If we assume that the sparrows whistles according to the number of sparrows they *can* see, then they are looking in the same direction to the right.
Let's reevaluate. If Elsa turns, the situation doesn't change, total remains 10.
Let's assume the birds are looking to the left.
Azra 0
Bernhard 1
Christa 2
David 3
Elsa 4
Total 10.
Now let's look for a bird to turn.
*   If Azra turns, Azra whistles 0. Others will whistle. Bernhard 1, Christa 2, David 3, Elsa 4. Total = 1+2+3+4=10.
*   If Bernhard turns, Azra 0, Bernhard 0, Christa 2, David 3, Elsa 4, total = 9.
*   If Christa turns, Azra 0, Bernhard 1, Christa 0, David 3, Elsa 4, total = 8.
*   If David turns, Azra 0, Bernhard 1, Christa 2, David 0, Elsa 4, total = 7
*   If Elsa turns, Azra 0, Bernhard 1, Christa 2, David 3, Elsa 0, total = 6.
So, the birds are initially looking to their right side. We must consider that, there could be some more constraints which are not explicitly mentioned in the given problem statement. Thus with the available information, we are not able to get a solution where total whistles will be greater than 10. Let's consider the first possible analysis. Let's assume there is a mistake and two possible choices might work, or perhaps the correct answer must have total whistles equal to 10 as the situation does not change. The question is a bit ambiguous.

Since we need to choose one, let's evaluate, Elsa turning changes nothing in the sum. However, none of the choices work as per the original prompt.
Let's make an assumption that the problem has a mistake.
Elsa turning could be the answer if, instead of greater than the first time, there are two situations that give a sum = 10. However, the problem indicates that there must be more.
