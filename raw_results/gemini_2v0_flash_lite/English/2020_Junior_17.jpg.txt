Reasoning:
The angle AOB is formed by lines drawn from the point of tangency of the circles to the corners of the square. The line from O to the corner touches the side, which is part of the square. Also, there is a line of symmetry that cuts the square in half from one corner to the opposite corner. The point O, the meeting point, is the point where the two tangent circles meet each other. The angle at the corner of the square is 90 degrees. The angles formed between the lines from the point of tangency, the lines that touch the side of the square are 90 degrees.  Therefore, we have a quadrilateral, with two 90-degree angles, and a 90-degree angle, and by symmetry the other angles are equal. This indicates that the other angles are 45 degrees. The sum of internal angles for the quadrilateral is 360 degrees. Hence, the angle AOB is 135 degrees.
