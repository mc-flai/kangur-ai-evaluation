Reasoning:
The correct ratio of blue to yellow is 2:3. The painter mixed 3 liters of blue and 2 liters of yellow. This makes a total of 5 liters of the wrong shade. The total volume should be the same (5 liters).
To find the correct amount to throw away, consider what the correct ratio dictates. If we keep the correct ratio of blue to yellow (2:3), and we'll set up a system of equations. Let 'b' be the amount of blue paint needed and 'y' be the amount of yellow paint needed:

1.  b + y = 5 - x (where x is the amount thrown away)
2.  b/y = 2/3, meaning 3b = 2y

The painter has 3 liters of blue and 2 liters of yellow.  If the correct ratio is 2:3 and we end up with 5 liters total, then we solve for how much paint needs to be thrown away.  Let x be the amount to throw away. The amounts of blue and yellow currently are 3 and 2, respectively. After throwing away, we need b and y such that b+y=5. We can find the ratios:

Throwing away some of the blue (b = 3), lets figure out how much yellow must be mixed with it: 3/2 = 1.5, meaning we should have 3*3/2 = 4.5.

Using the ratio to figure out how much of each remains. Let x = amount thrown away. Remaining amounts are:
Blue = 3 - x(3/5)
Yellow = 2 - x(2/5)
Total: 3-3x/5 + 2-2x/5 = 5-x
And the ratios:
(3-3x/5) / (2-2x/5) = 2/3
Solving: 3(3-3x/5) = 2(2-2x/5) => 9 - 9x/5 = 4 - 4x/5 => 5 = 5x/5 => x= 5/5 * 5 => x = 5/5
or
3 * (3 - (3/5)*x) = 2 * (2 - (2/5)*x)
9 - (9/5)x = 4 - (4/5)x
5 = (5/5)x
x = 5/9
Amount to throw away: 5/9
