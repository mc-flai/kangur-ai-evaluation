Reasoning: I need to determine which of the 5 given figures uses the least number of cubes. I'll count the cubes in each:

*   (A): 5 cubes
*   (B): 6 cubes
*   (C): 6 cubes
*   (D): 5 cubes
*   (E): 6 cubes

The smallest number of cubes is 5. Since options A and D both use 5 cubes, I will choose the first one of them (A).

Answer: A)
