Reasoning: The kangaroo moves 7 steps up, and the rabbit moves 3 steps down. We need to determine the rabbit's position when the kangaroo is on step 56.
Let's find out how many sets of moves have occurred:
Number of sets of moves = kangaroo's step number / 7 = 56 / 7 = 8
So, 8 sets of moves have happened.
Since the rabbit goes down 3 steps in each set, the rabbit's position is:
Rabbit's starting point: 100 (given by image)
Rabbit's step number = 100 - (8 * 3) = 100 - 24 = 76

Answer: B)
