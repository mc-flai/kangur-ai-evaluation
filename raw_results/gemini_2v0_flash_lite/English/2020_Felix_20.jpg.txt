Reasoning: The numbers on opposite faces of the cube add up to the same sum. The cube shows 4, 5 and 8. The question wants us to find what number could be on the opposite face of the number 8.

The other numbers are chosen from integers 1 to 9, one number per face and no number is repeated, so when we look at the choices A, B, C, D, and E. We should look for an answer that works with the other visible faces.

Let's assume 8 is opposite 3. The sum on opposite faces would be 8+3 = 11.
So we would have 4+x = 11 or 5+y = 11. This means x=7 and y=6. So, the number 3 can be on the opposite of 8, and also 6 and 7 are viable for other pairs.

Answer: A)
