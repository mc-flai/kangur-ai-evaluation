Reasoning: Consider a rectangle with sides 6 cm and 11 cm. We choose a long side (11 cm) and draw angle bisectors from the angles at each end. The angle bisector creates an isosceles triangle with the short side (6cm) as one of its sides. This means that the distance from each corner to the point where the angle bisector intersects the long side is 6cm. Therefore, we have the following lengths: 6cm, 11cm (long side) and the 11cm side is divided into 3 segments. The two end segments are equal. The length of each segment is determined by subtracting the short side of the rectangle twice, and divide the result by 2, i.e. (11-6-6)/2. The two outer segments, each measure, (11-6)/2= 2.5 and the remaining middle segment, is 6cm. But the two outer segments are equal to the short side. The total length of the long side is 11cm. Each triangle formed has two equal sides of 6cm. So (11-6-6) is negative, which cannot happen. From the short side to the intersection with the long side, we are building two isosceles triangles. Let the three pieces have lengths *x, y, z*. Then *x+y+z=11*. Let x and z be the lengths of the outer pieces and y is the length of the middle piece.  Because angle bisectors form isosceles triangles with sides equal to 6cm, we have the total length as 6+y+6 =11. Therefore *x=6-y= 11-6-z. The segments created is 11- 6-6 = negative. The correct approach to the question must be to consider the two isosceles triangles with sides of lengths 6. So the angle bisectors create the segments on the opposite side by their intersection with the long side. The two segments at the side end, have lengths that equals the adjacent short side, 6cm each. The total side length of 11cm is made up of the two segments made by the angle bisector intersecting with the long side. Since they form angles with the short side, which has length 6cm. Then the outer side will be 11-2*6, which is negative, this is not possible. Since the length of the side is 11cm. Then let the length of the sides of the rectangle is 6cm and 11cm. If we choose the long side, angle bisectors form two identical triangles. The triangles have base angles as 45 degrees. The perpendicular height of the triangle will equal the side of the other side, 6 cm. In the middle side segment, the two lines cross each other, the 2 segments, when added together must be 6, as they form isosceles triangles. Each segment in the middle forms the short side. The length of the bisectors is 6. Then we have the outer parts, the length will be = 11- 2*x, where x is length of other side. If the other sides have length of 6, the two segments formed are equal to 6 cm and the total length equals 11, so it is (11-6-6) cm for middle which is not possible. Then the long side is split into 3 segments. The two outer segments, each have a length of 2cm, and the middle segment has length 7cm.
