Reasoning:
We want to minimize the number of petals left over. The flowers have 6, 7, 8, and 11 petals. We can repeatedly take off a petal from three flowers at a time.
1.  Subtract 1 from the three highest numbers: 6, 7, 8, 11 becomes 5, 6, 7, 10.
2.  Subtract 1 from the three highest numbers: 5, 6, 7, 10 becomes 4, 5, 6, 9.
3.  Subtract 1 from the three highest numbers: 4, 5, 6, 9 becomes 3, 4, 5, 8.
4.  Subtract 1 from the three highest numbers: 3, 4, 5, 8 becomes 2, 3, 4, 7.
5.  Subtract 1 from the three highest numbers: 2, 3, 4, 7 becomes 1, 2, 3, 6.
6.  Subtract 1 from the three highest numbers: 1, 2, 3, 6 becomes 0, 1, 2, 5.
7.  Subtract 1 from the three highest numbers: 0, 1, 2, 5 becomes 0, 0, 1, 4.
8.  Subtract 1 from the three highest numbers: 0, 0, 1, 4 becomes 0, 0, 0, 3.
We can't subtract anymore. The numbers of petals remaining are 0, 0, 0, 3, so the minimum number of petals left over is 3.
