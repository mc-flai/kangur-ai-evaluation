Reasoning: The latest possible date for the third Thursday of March is when the first Thursday of March is on the 1st of March. If the first Thursday is March 1st, then the second Thursday is March 8th, and the third Thursday is March 15th. However, the third Thursday can be later if the first Thursday is later in the month. If the first Thursday is March 7th, then the second Thursday is March 14th and the third Thursday is March 21st. If the first Thursday is March 8th, then the second Thursday is March 15th and the third Thursday is March 22nd. Therefore, the latest possible date is March 22nd.
