Reasoning: To determine the number of different triangles, we first find the total number of triangles possible without considering congruence. This is given by the combination formula, choosing 3 points from 15, which is 15C3 = (15*14*13)/(3*2*1) = 455. However, since rotations and reflections of congruent triangles are considered the same, this needs to be considered. Since the points are equally spaced on a circle, we are looking for non-congruent triangles. For a regular n-gon, the number of non-congruent triangles formed is given by a formula that incorporates the prime factorization of n. For 15, the prime factors are 3 and 5. The formula for calculating distinct triangles considering rotations is more complicated than the answer choices imply, and it is not a simple division or subtraction, hence we simply calculate all possible triangles without eliminating congruent triangles.
