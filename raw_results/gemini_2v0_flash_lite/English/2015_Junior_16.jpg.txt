Reasoning: The problem states that the product of the father's and son's ages equals 2015.  We need to find the factors of 2015 and determine their difference, which will be the age gap.  The prime factorization of 2015 is 5 x 13 x 31. Therefore, 2015 can be expressed as 5 x 403, 13 x 155, 31 x 65. Since both father and son were born in the 20th century, it implies that the age gap is between 1 and 100 years. Possible combinations are father being 65 and son being 31, father being 155 and son being 13, or father being 403 and son being 5. Because it's implied that both lived in the 20th century, the only possible combination that makes sense is 31 and 65. The age gap is 65 - 31 = 34.
