Reasoning: The question asks which net forms a closed loop when folded into a cube. Let's analyze each option by visualizing the folding process:
*   **(A)** When folded, the line segments would connect to form a closed loop.
*   **(B)** The line segments would not connect to form a closed loop.
*   **(C)** The line segments would not connect to form a closed loop.
*   **(D)** The line segments would not connect to form a closed loop.
*   **(E)** The line segments would not connect to form a closed loop.

Answer: A)
