Reasoning: When a gear turns clockwise, the teeth of the connected gears move in the opposite direction. The small (purple) gear turns clockwise. The red gear connected to it will turn counterclockwise, and the blue gear also connected to the purple gear will turn counterclockwise. The initial position of the black teeth is marked. By following the tooth position changes after the purple gear makes a full turn, we get a correct orientation of the gears, the purple gear tooth would shift to the right and down a bit, the red gear's tooth would shift up and to the left a bit and the blue gear's tooth would shift down and to the left a bit.

Answer: A)
