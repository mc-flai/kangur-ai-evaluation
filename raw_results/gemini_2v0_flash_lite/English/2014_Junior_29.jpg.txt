Reasoning:
1.  The problem asks for the last number in the first half of a list of 7-digit numbers formed using the digits 1 to 7 exactly once in each number.
2.  The total number of such numbers is 7! = 5040.
3.  The list is split in the middle so that each sublist has 5040 / 2 = 2520 numbers.
4.  The last number of the first sublist is the 2520th number in the ordered list.
5.  Consider the first digit. Numbers starting with 1, 2, and 3 will be in the first half.
6.  Numbers starting with 1 have 6! = 720 permutations.
7.  Numbers starting with 2 have 6! = 720 permutations.
8.  Numbers starting with 3 have 6! = 720 permutations.
9.  The 2160th number will start with 3.
10. 2520 - 2160 = 360 more numbers are left.
11. The numbers beginning with 4 are included in the first half. The question now becomes:
12. What is the 360th number beginning with 4?
13. If the second digit is 1, then the number of permutations of the last 5 digits is 5! = 120. Numbers of the form 41xxxxx make up numbers 1-120 of the remaining list.
14. The next value for the second digit could be 2, so 42xxxxx are 121-240 of the remaining list.
15. The third value for the second digit can be 3, so 43xxxxx are 241-360, so the final answer will begin with 43.
16. Numbers of form 431xxxx are 120 in total.
17. Numbers of form 432xxxx are 120 in total.
18. Consider numbers starting with 43. The smallest such number is 4312567. The 360th number from our list is the largest number that starts with 43, and so is 4376521.
19. Thus we need to find the 360th number that starts with 4, and then the last digit of this number.
20. Numbers beginning with 41xxxx has 5! = 120 permutations. (1-120)
21. Numbers beginning with 42xxxx has 5! = 120 permutations. (121-240)
22. Numbers beginning with 43xxxx has 5! = 120 permutations. (241-360)
23. So the 360th number will begin with 43, then the digits are in descending order to create the largest value within that range.
24. Thus the number is 4376521.
