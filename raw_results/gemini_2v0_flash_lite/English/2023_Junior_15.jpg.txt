Reasoning: Let the side of the equilateral triangle ABC be $x$. Since triangles AEF, DFE, and CDF are isosceles and all four triangles have the same perimeter, let the equal sides of the isosceles triangles be $y$. Then the perimeter of triangle ABC is $3x$ and the perimeter of triangle AEF is $x + 2y$.
Since the perimeters are the same, we have $3x = x + 2y$, which implies $2x = 2y$ or $x = y$.
Now, the perimeter of the pentagon ABCDE is $x + x + x + y + y = 3x + 2y$.  Since $y = x$, the perimeter of ABCDE is $3x + 2x = 5x$.
The perimeter of triangle ABC is $3x$.
The ratio of the perimeter of ABCDE to the perimeter of ABC is $\frac{5x}{3x} = \frac{5}{3}$.
