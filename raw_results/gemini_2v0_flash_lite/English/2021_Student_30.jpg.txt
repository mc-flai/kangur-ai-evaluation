Reasoning:
Let's use a state diagram or consider the possible sequences of points won. A needs to win 2 more points to win the game. B needs to win 4 more points to win the game.
Let P(A wins) be the probability that A wins the game.
If A wins the next point (probability 1/2), A is 2 points ahead, then needs 1 more point. If B wins next point (1/2) then A is 1 ahead, again.
If A wins the next two points, A wins. Probability is (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4.
If A wins then B wins, then A wins: (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)=1/8
If B wins then A wins then A wins: (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/8
Probability A wins = (1/2)^2 + 2*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4 + 2/8 = 1/2.
However, we can consider that A is one point ahead. Then A wins if A wins 2 points before B wins 4 points.
Consider the possible outcomes. A wins the next point. If A wins the next point, A wins (probability 1/4). If B wins the next point, they are back at the 1 point lead.
Let p be the probability that A wins the game, given that A is 1 point ahead.
p = (1/2) + (1/2) * (1/2) + (1/2)*(1/2)p
p = 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/2p
p = (1/2)(A wins 2 points) + (1/4)(A wins 1, B wins 1) + (1/8)(A wins 1, B wins 2)...
Let's approach it another way.
A is ahead by 1 point.  A needs 2 more points to win.  B needs 3 more points to win.
The game ends when A wins 2 more points or B wins 3 more points.
A wins the game if AA, ABA, BAA, BBAA, ABBA...
Ways A wins: AA (1/4), BAB (1/8), ABAB (1/8)
Ways B wins: BBB, ABBB, BABB, BBAA
Using a tree diagram:
A wins the first, then A wins the second, probability = 1/4.
A wins the first, B wins the second, A wins the third, probability = 1/8
B wins the first, A wins the second, A wins the third, probability = 1/8
A wins first, B wins second, B wins third (A down 1, B 2),
Prob(A wins) = 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 4/8 = 1/2
Alternative solution
A needs to be 3 points ahead. If A wins next point, A is 2 points ahead. If A wins next point, A wins.
If A loses the next one, it is back to 1 point ahead. If A wins next point, A is 2 ahead.
P(A wins) = (1/2)(A wins 2 points).
If A wins the first point. Probability of A winning the game after that is
(1/2) * 1 + (1/2) * P(A wins if A is 1 ahead).
A needs to win the game, 2 more to win.
If A is 1 up, P(A wins) = 3/4.  If A wins, then A wins. If A loses, A is one down.

Consider the states where the difference is 1, 2, 3...
Let p(1) be the probability A wins when A is 1 ahead.
p(1) = (1/2)p(2) + (1/2)p(0)
p(2) = (1/2)(1) + (1/2)p(1)
p(0) = (1/2)p(1) + (1/2)p(-1)
p(-1) = ...

Answer: C)
Let x be the probability that A wins.
When A is 1 point ahead, there are two more scenarios:
A wins next point (A wins) with probability 1/2.
B wins next point. Then A is 1 ahead. Prob = 1/2 * x
x = (1/2) + (1/2) * (1/2 + (1/2)x)
If A gets a 2 point lead, 1/2 * x + 1/2

x= (1/2) * (1 + (1/2)x)
When A is one ahead, then A wins if A wins next 2 or A wins, B wins, A wins.
Let x = prob A wins given A is 1 ahead.
x = (1/2)(1) + (1/2)[(1/2)(1) + (1/2)x]
x= 3/4

x = (1/2) + (1/2) * x
x = 3/4

Answer: C)

Reasoning: Let the probability of A winning be x. When A is 1 point ahead, we consider these scenarios:
- A wins next point (probability 1/2), then A is 2 points ahead. Now, to win, either A wins the next point (1/2) to reach 3 points ahead, or B wins next point (1/2) bringing the score to 1 ahead, at which point the probability A wins is x. Therefore, the probability is (1/2)*(1) + (1/2)x.
- B wins next point (probability 1/2), then A is still 1 ahead so the probability is x.

x= 1/2(1) + 1/2(x) x = (1/2)(A wins next) + 1/2(B wins next)
x = 1/2 + 1/2.x  x = (1/2 * 1) + (1/2 x x) or 2 ahead = 1, next step is (1/2+1/4)
Or x = 1/2 + 1/2*x
If A is ahead by 1. x, must take at least 1 win 3 points. (1/2+ (1/2 * x)) x=1/2 +1/2x.
A is ahead by 1. x = 1/2 (Probability of getting 2 pts)
x= 1/4 + 1/8
If A is 2 pts up: (A, A) x (A wins) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 A wins
A (A, B or B, A) = 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4 A wins
B and A wins.
A needs to win 2 games out of 3. A B A, B A A. or A wins, B then A
A is ahead by 1 point, it needs 2 more points to win.
If A wins. A is 2 ahead
The prob that A wins = 3/4
If A loses 1 point. A wins if A wins A wins, or B wins A wins or A wins B
(1/2)
Prob of A win at 2 pts ahead. If A wins next, A wins, B is back. x

Probability
1 = 1/4 + 2/8
