Reasoning:
Let the total number of participants be *x*.
35% of *x* are female, so 0.35*x* are female.
The rest (100% - 35% = 65%) are male, so 0.65*x* are male.
There are 252 more males than females, thus the difference between the number of males and females is 252. This can be written as:
0.65*x* - 0.35*x* = 252
0.30*x* = 252
*x* = 252 / 0.30
*x* = 840
The total number of participants is 840, which is more than 800 as stated in the problem.
