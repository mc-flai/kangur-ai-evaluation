Reasoning: The numbers 1 through 6 are to be placed in the circles. Since the sum of the numbers on each ring are the same, and one of the numbers, 6, is shown, we need to calculate which number will result in the same sum. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 add up to 21. Therefore, each ring needs to have the same sum and the sum of the numbers in each ring must be 21/3 which is 7. From the image, we know that 6 is on one of the intersection circles, so to make the sum 7 we have to use number 1.

Answer: A)
