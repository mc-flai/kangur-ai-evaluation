Reasoning:
1. We are given that Carl is not wearing a hat.
2. The second conditional statement tells us that if Bob doesn't wear a hat, Carl wears a hat. Since Carl is not wearing a hat, this means Bob *must* be wearing a hat.
3. The first conditional statement tells us that if Alex doesn't wear a hat, Bob wears a hat. However, since we know Bob is wearing a hat, we can't determine whether Alex is wearing a hat.
