Reasoning:
The car travels for 35 minutes. Buses leave every 3 minutes.
First, find the total number of buses that leave during the car's travel time: 35 minutes / 3 minutes per bus = 11.66 buses. This means 11 full buses will leave.
However, the problem states that the bus that leaves at the same time as the car does not count. Therefore, the car overtakes 11 - 0 = 11 buses.
