Reasoning:
Let's analyze the weights of the boxes. The total weight of bananas is three times the weight of apples. The boxes contain either apples or bananas, but not both. We need to find which boxes contain apples.  Let 'a' be the total weight of apples and 'b' the total weight of bananas. We know that b = 3a. The total weight of all boxes is 7+5+6+2+16 = 36 kg.
Also a+b= 36kg and as b=3a we can rewrite the sum as a+3a =36 kg or 4a=36 kg. This gives us a = 9 kg and b=27 kg.

We need to find which boxes sum up to 9kg, the weight of the apples.
Let's check the options:
A) 1 and 2: 7+5 = 12kg
B) 2 and 3: 5+6 = 11kg
C) 2 and 4: 5+2 = 7kg
D) 3 and 4: 6+2 = 8kg
E) 1 and 4: 7+2 = 9kg. This is the total weight of apples.

Answer: E)
