Reasoning: Let 'x' be the amount each of Bia and Cris had initially. Ana had 2x.  Before the movie, the total amount was 2x + x + x = 4x = 100. So, x = 25. Therefore, Ana had 50 and Bia and Cris each had 25 initially. Let 'y' be the cost of the entrance. After paying, Ana has 50 - y and Bia and Cris have 25 - y each.  Now, Ana has three times what the two friends have together: 50 - y = 3 * (25 - y + 25 - y).  50 - y = 3 * (50 - 2y).  50 - y = 150 - 6y.  5y = 100.  y = 20.
