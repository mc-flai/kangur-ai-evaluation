Reasoning: A cube has 12 edges. To walk along each edge at least once and return to the starting point, we need to consider the fact that each vertex has an even number of edges connected to it so we can walk on those edges and return. A cube has 8 vertices, and each vertex connects to 3 edges. In order to make each vertex having an even number of connections, we must "duplicate" some edges to create an Eulerian circuit. A cube has 8 vertices, each with an odd degree (3). We need to add extra paths to make the degree of each vertex even. The minimum number of edges to duplicate to allow for this Euler circuit is 4. Because each vertex has an odd degree of 3, the ant needs to traverse at least 4 extra edges. A cube has 12 edges. So, the minimum distance would be 12 + 4 = 16.
