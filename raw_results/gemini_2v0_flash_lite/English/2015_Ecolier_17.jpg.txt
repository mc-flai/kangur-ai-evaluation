Reasoning: The shape in Figure 1 can be divided into smaller triangles of the same size as the one shown in Figure 2.  By carefully looking at the grid, we can deduce how many of these triangles can be fit inside the overall figure. We can imagine the figure as a combination of rectangles and right triangles. The large rectangle is 3 x 3 = 9 triangles.  The top triangle has area equal to 1 triangle. The bottom left "L" shape is composed of 4 triangles. Therefore, the total number of small triangles is 9+4+1 = 14.
