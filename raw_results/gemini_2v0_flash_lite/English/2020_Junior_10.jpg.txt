Reasoning: The kite is divided into two main areas: blue and yellow. By observing the diagram, we can see that the blue area occupies 2/3 of the total area of the kite and the yellow area takes the remaining 1/3. Therefore the ratio between the blue and yellow parts of the kite is 2/1 or 2. None of the options corresponds to this value. However, based on the wording of the question we can infer that it's asking for the ratio of blue to yellow. The ratio between blue and yellow is 2:1. Given the options, the question could have a typo and should have asked, what is the ratio of yellow to blue. In such case the ratio would be 1:2. However, the option that best fits the image given is the one in which the blue part (2 parts) is divided by the yellow part (1 part), meaning that the ratio will be 2/1=2. However, since there is no option for it, let's think of this differently. Looking at the image, we can see the blue area is 2/3 and the yellow area is 1/3. Therefore, the ratio of blue to yellow is (2/3) / (1/3) = 2/1 = 2. Since no option equals 2, and since the question seems to have a typo, let us assume the options are incorrect and the question intended to ask for the ratio of blue to the total area or the yellow to the total area. In this case it could be that the solution is asking the ratio of the yellow area to the blue area, which will be 1/2 or 1:2 and this can be related to option A) by a typo if the question was "What is the ratio between yellow and blue parts of the kite?".
Answer: A)
