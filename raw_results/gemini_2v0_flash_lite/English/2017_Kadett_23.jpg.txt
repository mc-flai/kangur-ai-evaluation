Reasoning: To minimize the number of different sums, Diana should add the same value (either 2 or 5) as much as possible. Let's consider the two scenarios:

Scenario 1: She adds 2 to all numbers. The sums would be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. This would result in 9 different values.
Scenario 2: She adds 5 to all numbers. The sums would be 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. This would also result in 9 different values.

To reduce the number of sums, consider adding 2 to some numbers and 5 to others. The numbers are 1 to 9. If we consistently choose the values such that if the result can be obtained in two different ways, then we can minimize the amount of unique values.

If we add 2 to the numbers 1-4 and add 5 to the numbers 5-9, then we have: 1+2=3, 2+2=4, 3+2=5, 4+2=6, 5+5=10, 6+5=11, 7+5=12, 8+5=13, 9+5=14. This also has 9 different sums.
Let's try a mix:
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
add 2 to:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
add 5 to:
6, 7, 8, 9
Sums: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 = 9 values

Add 5 to the smallest numbers: 1,2,3,4,5 = 6,7,8,9,10
Add 2 to 6,7,8,9 = 8,9,10,11
So we have values from 6,7,8,9,10,11. = 6 different sums.

Add 5 to 1,2,3 = 6,7,8
Add 2 to 4,5,6,7,8,9 = 6,7,8,9,10,11
The sums would be 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, resulting in 6 different values.
