Reasoning: The sum of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20. Since the two boxes must have the same sum, each box must have a sum of 20 / 2 = 10. The card with number 4 is placed in one of the two boxes, therefore the other numbers in this box must add up to 6 to get the desired sum (10). The only number that adds to 6 is 6. Therefore, the number 6 must be in the box with the number 4.
