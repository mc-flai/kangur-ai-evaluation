Reasoning: The problem states that Sven writes five different single-digit positive whole numbers, and no sum of two of those numbers is equal to 10. Single-digit positive whole numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The pairs that sum to 10 are (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), and (4,6), (5,5) but we need to have different numbers. If Sven used a 5, he cannot use the other 5 to make the sum 10, but we need five different numbers. If Sven picks 5, then Sven cannot pick any of these pairs. If we want to find which number MUST be on the list, consider what other combinations exist that have the given rule of sums don't equal 10.

Let's examine the possible combinations by testing a few different options:
* If Sven picked 1, then 9 is not allowed. Then, he could pick 2, 3, 4, and 5,6,7,8 so this is not a possibility.
* If Sven picked 2, then 8 is not allowed, so Sven could pick 1,3,4,5,6,7,9 so this is not the correct choice.
* If Sven picked 3, then 7 is not allowed, so Sven could pick 1,2,4,5,6,8,9 so this is not a possibility.
* If Sven picked 4, then 6 is not allowed, so Sven could pick 1,2,3,5,7,8,9 so this is not a possibility.
* If Sven picked 5, then 5 is not allowed, 5 can not be one of the numbers, since no sum of 2 numbers equals 10.  If we pick (1,2,3,4) then this is all below the required list.

The question implies there is only 1 correct answer among the list of numbers.
The possible options include A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5.
We can eliminate options.
If the numbers were 1,2,3,4 then this would not fit. So, Sven MUST write 5 on the board.

Answer: E)
