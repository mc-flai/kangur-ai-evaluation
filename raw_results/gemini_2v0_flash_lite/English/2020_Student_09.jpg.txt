Reasoning: Each die has 6 faces, 2 red, 2 blue, and 2 green. We want to find the probability of getting two different colors.  First, consider the probability of NOT getting two different colors (i.e. same colors).  The probability of both dice landing on red is (2/6)*(2/6) = 1/9. The same is true for blue and green. So, the probability of getting the same color is 1/9 + 1/9 + 1/9 = 3/9 = 1/3.  The probability of getting different colors is 1 - (probability of same colors) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.
