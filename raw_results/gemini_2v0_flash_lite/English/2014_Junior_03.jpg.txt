Reasoning:
By observation, we can estimate the lengths of the wires as follows:
*   'a' has a length of approximately 4 units.
*   'b' has a length of approximately 6 units.
*   'c' has a length of approximately 3 units.
So, we can say that c < a < b. Thus, the correct inequality is c < b < a which is given in option (E).

Answer: E)
