Reasoning: The numbers in the circles must be from 1 to 7 inclusive. The sum of the numbers in two adjacent circles equals the number between them. Since the question mark has 6 and 9 between them, the two circles adjacent to the question mark circle should have numbers that add up to 6 and 9. Since one adjacent circle already has 9 and the other has 6, the missing number must be one to fulfill the numbers 1 to 7 inclusive.
Therefore, the number in the circle with the question mark must add to 9 with the number in the next circle and to 6 with the number in the other next circle. This is only possible if the question mark is replaced with a 1.
