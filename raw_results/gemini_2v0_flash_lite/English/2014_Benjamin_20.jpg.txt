Reasoning: First, we determine the total length of the songs: 3 mins + 2 mins 30 s + 2 mins + 1 min 30 s + 4 mins = 13 minutes. Andy leaves when song C is playing. An hour is 60 minutes. To find out which song is playing after an hour, we need to know how many times the songs cycle. 60 minutes / 13 minutes per cycle = 4 cycles with a remainder of 8 minutes. So after four full cycles, the same song will be playing. Since the songs are played in order, to know which song is playing after 8 minutes, we calculate the total time of the songs starting from song C: song C 2 mins, song D 1 min 30 s, song E 4 mins, song A 3 mins. 2 + 1.5 + 4 = 7.5 minutes. We started with song C, so after 7.5 minutes, it becomes song A. 8 minutes is more than the 7.5 minutes it takes to reach song A, so song A is playing at that moment.
Answer: A)
