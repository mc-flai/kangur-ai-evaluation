Reasoning:
First, count the matches used to form the number 20. The '2' uses 5 matches, and the '0' uses 6 matches. So far, 11 matches have been used. To complete the number 2022, we need to add another '2' and another '2'. Each '2' needs 5 matches. Therefore, for the entire number 2022, we have used 11 + 5 + 5 = 21 matches. Karo started with 30 matches. The number of matches remaining is 30 - 21 = 9.
