Reasoning: The question asks how many different positive whole numbers can be formed using exactly 6 matchsticks. Looking at the diagram provided, here are the matchsticks used for each digit:
- 0: 6 matchsticks
- 1: 2 matchsticks
- 2: 5 matchsticks
- 3: 5 matchsticks
- 4: 4 matchsticks
- 5: 5 matchsticks
- 6: 6 matchsticks
- 7: 3 matchsticks
- 8: 7 matchsticks
- 9: 6 matchsticks
We need to find the combinations that add up to 6.
- The digits that use exactly 6 matchsticks are 0, 6, and 9.
- With 6 matchsticks, possible single-digit numbers are 0, 6, and 9.
- We could also form a two-digit number. We cannot form a 6 digit number with 0 as the first digit since 0 is the only number that takes 6 matchsticks. We cannot do it with 6 or 9 either, as these also take 6 matchsticks.
Therefore, the possible positive whole numbers that can be formed with 6 matchsticks are 0, 6, and 9. Because zero cannot be the first digit of a positive whole number. The possible values are 6 and 9. The total number of different positive whole numbers is 3.
However, since the question requests a positive whole number 0 is not included.
Thus, the answer should be based on digits 6 and 9.
Now with 6 matchsticks, the only available digits would be 6 or 9.
So, the possible numbers are 6, 9.
The problem asks how many different positive whole numbers can be formed with exactly 6 matchsticks.
Only the digits 0, 6, and 9 each use 6 matchsticks.  But the question says positive whole numbers, so zero is excluded. Thus, we have the positive numbers 6 and 9.

Thus, only 6 and 9 are eligible.
Also, we could form numbers using multiple digits:
- Number 6 (6 sticks)
- Number 9 (6 sticks)
Total = 2.
Since the question asks, how many DIFFERENT positive whole numbers, there are only two possible numbers, 6 and 9.
