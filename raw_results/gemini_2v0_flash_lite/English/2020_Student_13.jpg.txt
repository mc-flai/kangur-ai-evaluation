Reasoning:
1. **Calculate the surface area reduction:** When the pieces are glued together, some faces are no longer exposed.
2. **Identify hidden faces:** In this structure, 3 faces of the top 3 cubes are covered by the other top pieces, 3 faces of the bottom 3 cubes are also covered by the other top pieces and another block is covered by the cubes, thus, the cubes have lost 6 faces of their area. And the remaining 2 blocks lost 1 faces in total. So, total 7 faces less.
3. **Determine surface area per face:** If 18 liters cover all faces of the separate pieces, and she uses 6 cubes and 2 rectangular blocks, and from the figure, we find there are 8 blocks, with 6 of them are cubes, which is 6 cube faces. Since the question only mentions "eight faces", it suggests that the cubes are forming a single block, so they can be counted like a rectangular block. Thus, we have 18 liters / (6 cubes * 6 faces/cube + 2 blocks * 6 faces/block) = 18 / 48 = 0.375 liters per face.
4. **Calculate the total liters for the combined structure:** The total face reduction from the cubes is 6. So, the total reduction face is 6 (from the blocks) + 1 (from the cubes) = 7, from the calculation above, we know one face needs 0.375 liters, so we should subtract these covered faces from the total paint. The result would be: 18 - 7 faces * 0.375 liters/face = 18 - 2.625 = 15.375. Since the cube is on top, there won't be a face covering the top layer. Therefore, we remove the surface area from 7 faces. Since we know, each block has six faces. This means that each block has 6 faces and 0.375 liters of paint, so 7 faces would need: 0.375 * 7 = 2.625 liters. So, if painted after gluing, the liters required would be: 18 liters - 2.625 liters = 15.375 liters.
However, the answer has to be one of the options, and the structure is composed of 3 cubes, 3 cubes and 2 blocks. If we sum all sides before gluing: the upper cubes have 18 faces, bottom cubes have 18 faces, and two blocks have 12 faces, giving a total of 48 faces.
The question says that the initial paint used, before gluing, is 18 liters.
Then each face require, 18 liters / 48 faces = 0.375 liters/face
If we consider the structure after gluing: we have the two blocks, the total faces are 6x2=12.
In the upper block, we have 3 sides each, and the lower cubes has 3*4 =12 faces (excluding the top), total faces for the cubes are 12+3*2 = 18 faces.
So total faces after gluing: 12+18 = 30 faces.
30 faces * 0.375 liters/face = 11.25 liters.
Also, we have 7 faces less.
Therefore, 18- 0.375*7 = 18- 2.625 = 15.375.
The closest to 15.375 is (E) 16,0
Considering the cubes, we have total 3+3=6. So the two blocks would be covered by a 6 faces from the other side. Since we have 18 liters for 48 sides. So we have lost 6 sides + 1 face.
So, 18- 7 * 0.375= 15.375 liters.
The closest choice from the given choices are not close. Let's assume the initial volume of the cube is 1, so the bottom and upper cubes are 1, and the other blocks are 2, which has 6 sides. So we have the total area of 6 blocks and 2 rectangular blocks. 6 cubes * 6faces + 2 * rectangular faces, total faces = 48 faces.
Since each side of the cubes is a face, the covered face has 3 faces from the cubes from the top cubes, and 3 faces from the bottom. And 1 face for the rectangular blocks.
So the final total faces after gluing are 30 faces.
Since it is 30 sides, the question needs the area of the faces after the blocks are covered. And 7 faces are covered by the other pieces.
So we have 18 - 7* 0.375 = 15.375.
