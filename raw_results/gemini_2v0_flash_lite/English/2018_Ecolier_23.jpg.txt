Reasoning: The question asks which numbers can be placed in the field with the question mark. Two consecutive numbers can't be adjacent.
The field with the ? is adjacent to 3 other fields (top right, top left, and bottom).
Since no restriction is put on the numbers which must be placed on adjacent fields, we can only eliminate some combinations.
The numbers can be 1 to 7 so, 4 can be an option.
If a cell adjacent to the ? would contain a 3, then the field containing ? cannot hold 2 or 4. If a cell adjacent to the ? would contain a 5, then the field containing ? cannot hold 4 or 6. This logic doesn't eliminate any numbers from the fields.

Answer: A)
