Reasoning: Each building block is made up of 5 identical rectangles, so two blocks will contain 10 rectangles. We need to figure out which of the provided shapes can be constructed from 10 rectangles. Shape A has 10 rectangles, B has 6, C has 6, D has 8, E has 8 and the last shape has 10 rectangles. This means shape A, and the last shape can be made with two building blocks. Thus, only 2 patterns can be made.

Answer: B)
