Reasoning: The kangaroo starts with two branches, each having 10 leaves.  Let's say the kangaroo eats X leaves from the first branch.  This leaves 10 - X leaves on the first branch. Then, the kangaroo eats 10 - X leaves from the second branch, leaving X leaves on the second branch.  So, the total number of leaves left is (10 - X) + X = 10. The question doesn't specify how many leaves the kangaroo ate on the first branch. This doesn't change the total number of leaves left.

Answer: D)
