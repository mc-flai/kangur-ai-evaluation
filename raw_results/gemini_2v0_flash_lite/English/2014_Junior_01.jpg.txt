Reasoning: The third Thursday of March can fall on the 15th at the earliest, if the first of March is a Thursday. We can then verify if the other options can be correct. The options are based on the third Thursday of March, which would mean that the first Thursday could fall on the 1st, the 2nd, the 3rd or the 4th.

The first Thursday of March could be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.
If the first Thursday is the 1st, then the third Thursday would be the 15th.
If the first Thursday is the 2nd, then the third Thursday would be the 16th.
If the first Thursday is the 3rd, then the third Thursday would be the 17th.
If the first Thursday is the 4th, then the third Thursday would be the 18th.
