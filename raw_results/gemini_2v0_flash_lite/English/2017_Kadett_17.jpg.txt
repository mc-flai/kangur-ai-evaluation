Reasoning:
Simon wants to cut the wire into 9 pieces, which requires 8 cuts. Barbara wants to cut the wire into 8 pieces, which requires 7 cuts. Carl cuts at every mark, so he makes 8 cuts from Simon's marks and 7 cuts from Barbara's marks. In total, Carl makes 8 + 7 = 15 cuts, and the cuts do not overlap. Therefore, Carl will obtain 1 + 15 = 16 pieces.

Answer: B)
