Reasoning:  Let's analyze the possible positions of a point that is 1 cm from two corner points of the square. Consider two adjacent corner points.  The point must lie on a circle of radius 1 cm centered at each of the two corner points. The intersection of these two circles gives us two such points. Now, consider any two diagonally opposite corner points. The point must lie on a circle with radius 1 cm. There are two such circles but now the centers are 1 cm away from each other, the intersection gives no point at 1 cm. So, taking all the adjacent corner points of the square, and making circles from them, we'll get 2 points at each side (we have two intersecting circles). So, if we choose all the adjacent points, we have 4 sides for the square. Therefore, there are 2 x 2=4 points on the outside, plus one point at each corner where the two chosen sides meet and which is exactly 1 cm away from both corner points. Also note that there will be no points within the square as the length is 1 cm and the distance between corner points is the same. Hence, the answer will be 2 per edge * 2 edges (adjacent) + 1 = 5.
