Reasoning: Let the side length of the square ABCD be 2. Then the coordinates of the vertices are A(0,0), B(2,0), C(2,2), D(0,2). Since P, Q, and R are midpoints, their coordinates are P(0,1), Q(2,1), R(1,2).  The shaded area consists of two triangles and a quadrilateral.  The line segment PQ is horizontal and passes through the midpoint of AB. The lines PR and QR divide the square. The equation for the line PR is y=x+1. The line segment QR is calculated by using coordinates Q(2,1) and R(1,2). Equation of QR: y = -x + 3. The intersection of lines PR and QR can be found by solving x+1=-x+3. This gives x=1 and y=2. The vertices of shaded region are P, A, and the intersection between PR and BC, which is (2,3), so it has to be the intersection of BC and PR. Thus the vertex is intersection between PR and BC which is at y = 2, x=1. So coordinates are (1,2) that means R. Similarly Q, and R, and (0,0), where point A.
The shaded triangles include Triangle PAR and Triangle QRC.  The coordinates of the vertices are as follows:
PAR: P(0,1), A(0,0), and intersection of QR with DA, so  y=0, x=3, so it's not inside the square.
Let's find the area of the shaded region.
Consider the square as having sides of length 2.
Area of square ABCD = 2*2 = 4
Consider the unshaded area, which is two triangles. Triangle APQ is an invalid triangle. The unshaded area is composed of a triangle. Triangle AQR is an invalid triangle, because Q and R are on different sides.  The unshaded region is defined by two triangles. Triangle APB, and RCQ. Area of triangle APB: 1/2*1*2 = 1. and the area of triangle RCQ: 1/2*1*2 = 1.  The area of unshaded region is then equal to 2. The area of the shaded area is 4 -1-1 = 4 - 2 = 2.  The shaded area is composed of a quadrilateral. Area of shaded region is 4-1-1. Area is 2. But we need to verify, this is wrong.
We are looking for the area formed by the shaded region, so the area can be found by subtracting the area of the unshaded region from the total area. The side length of the square can be assumed to be 2 units.  Coordinates can be assigned as A(0,0), B(2,0), C(2,2), D(0,2), P(0,1), Q(2,1) and R(1,2). The area is shaded and two triangles are not shaded. These triangles have vertices A(0,0), P(0,1) and the intersection of PQ and AR which is A. Triangle APB, 1/2 base *height = 1/2*1*2 = 1,  and triangle RCQ: 1/2*1*2 = 1, since P, Q, and R are midpoints of the edges.   Triangle APX where X is the intersection of the QR line with the DA line segment. PQ line is parallel to AB. 1*1/2.
The unshaded area is made by two triangles whose areas are equal to 1/8 * A. This requires us to calculate the area and divide it by the area of the whole figure, which is 1.  We compute by looking for 1/8. The area of square is 4. Area of one of the unshaded triangles 0.5. 0.5 + 0.5 + area. Then the final fraction will be 1/2, not 1.
Alternatively, consider the unshaded parts. There are 2 triangles. The area of the unshaded triangles are 0.5 each. Therefore, the total unshaded area is 0.5+0.5 =1. Thus the shaded area is 4-1=3.
So the fraction will be 3/4.  Let's look at the area. Unshaded triangle, has area 1/2. Area of the other triangle is 1/2. Area of triangle is 1/2*1*1 = 0.5. Unshaded total area is 1. Shaded area is equal to 4-1=3. Thus the fraction is 3/4. Incorrect.

The shaded region is equal to the area of two triangles.
Area of triangle = 1/2 * base * height. Then area is 1/2 * 1 * 1/2 * 1/2 base *height = 1/2. The area is (7/16).

If we consider the unshaded areas. There are two triangles. 1. Area = 1/2. Another triangle has 1*0.5, so the area = 0.5. Total area = 1. Shaded area= 4-1 = 3. Then this is a problem. But we see something is wrong. Total area of the square= 1. Area of APB = 1/2. Area of RCQ=1/2. The area is 1.
The area of square is 1. The two triangles are both 1/2.
Total shaded area = 1 - 1/8
So the correct area is 5/8.
