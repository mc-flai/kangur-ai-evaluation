Reasoning: The mouse starts at the left and needs to go through the openings to exit the labyrinth.  There are two paths initially. Then there are two options on how to get to the exit after passing the center of the labyrinth.  We can count the different routes through the diagram.  Each opening can only be used once. The mouse has two paths, then it can go to the exit after passing the center in two ways. Therefore, the total ways are 2 * 2 = 4.
