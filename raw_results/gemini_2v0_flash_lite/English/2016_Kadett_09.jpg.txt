Reasoning: The total length of the ropes is 1m + 2m = 3m. The lengths of each piece have to be of equal length so the length of each piece must divide evenly into 3m. We will test each option.
*   (A) 6 pieces: 3m / 6 pieces = 0.5m per piece. Possible.
*   (B) 8 pieces: 3m / 8 pieces = 0.375m per piece. Possible.
*   (C) 9 pieces: 3m / 9 pieces = 1/3 m per piece. Possible.
*   (D) 12 pieces: 3m / 12 pieces = 0.25m per piece. Possible.
*   (E) 15 pieces: 3m / 15 pieces = 0.2m per piece. Possible.

Since none of the options can be ruled out in this fashion, let's examine the length of the ropes.
With a rope length of 1m and 2m, let's make a length of rope that is a multiple of 1 and 2. Therefore, Alex can't obtain the total amount of pieces if the amount of pieces is greater than the sum of the number of pieces the ropes can be cut into, while at the same time not a factor of the sum of the total length.
*   (A) 6 pieces: The 1m rope could be cut into 2 pieces and the 2m rope into 4, or any other combination that results in a total number of 6 pieces. Possible.
*   (B) 8 pieces: The 1m rope could be cut into 4 pieces and the 2m rope into 4. Possible.
*   (C) 9 pieces: This option is impossible since it does not share a factor with both the number of ropes, or their length.
*   (D) 12 pieces: The 1m rope could be cut into 4 pieces and the 2m rope into 8. Possible.
*   (E) 15 pieces: The 1m rope could be cut into 5 pieces and the 2m rope into 10. Possible.

Therefore, Alex could not have 9 pieces.

Answer: C)
