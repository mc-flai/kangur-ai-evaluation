Reasoning: Let's denote the length of AB as 30m, BC as 24m, and CD as 10m. Since the area of each land remains unchanged, the area of the smaller rectangle on the right side of the original fence (BC and CD forming its sides) remains the same. The height of the new land is equal to the height of the original combined area which is 24m. Since area remains constant, and the new "height" is the length of BC= 24m. We know that AE divides the larger plot in the same proportion as the original fence did. The part of the fence CD is now a part of a rectangle, of which E is the top-left corner, with a width of 10m. The width of the small rectangle formed by CD is 10m, then distance from D to E should be x=10m.

Answer: B)
