Reasoning:
1. Adam removes every 6th tile.  This means for every 6 tiles, 1 is removed.  Therefore, Adam removes 2022 / 6 = 337 tiles. Then the number of tiles remaining is 2022 - 337 = 1685 tiles.
2. Beate removes every 5th tile from the remaining tiles. This means for every 5 tiles remaining, 1 is removed.  So Beate removes 1685 / 5 = 337 tiles. Remaining tiles are 1685 - 337 = 1348.
3. Cora removes every 4th tile from the remaining tiles. This means for every 4 tiles remaining, 1 is removed.  So Cora removes 1348 / 4 = 337 tiles. Remaining tiles are 1348 - 337 = 1011.
