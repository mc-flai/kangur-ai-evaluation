Reasoning:
Let's label the boxes:
```
  A B C
  D
  E
```
The conditions are:
1.  If a number is below another, it is greater.
2.  If a number is to the right of another, it is greater.

Consider the possible positions of the number 5:
*   If 5 is in A, then B and C must be smaller than 5, which means they can be any combination of 1, 2, 3, and 4. D and E must also be smaller than 5.
*   If 5 is in B, then A and C must be smaller than 5. D and E must be smaller.
*   If 5 is in C, then A and B must be smaller than 5. D and E must be smaller.
*   If 5 is in D, then E < D < A, B, C. Then the options are 1,2,3,4,5
    *   5 must be in A or B or C
*   If 5 is in E, then E must be 1.
We could also consider where 1 goes, 1 must be at E. The smallest number must be placed in the bottom left corner.
If 5 is in A, then B and C are any combination of 1,2,3,4. This is not possible, 5 must be larger than B, C, D, E.

Let's try listing possibilities, starting by placing 1 in E.
1 in E
5 in A
Possible arrangements are:
5, 4, 3
2, 1
5, 4, 2
3, 1
5, 3, 2
4, 1
5, 4, 3
2, 1
and so on.

Let us analyze some placements. 1 is always at E. 5 must be in A, B, or C.
If 5 is in A: then B and C < 5, D < A. The condition can be met by placing 5 at A.
If 5 is in B: C < B, D and E< B
If 5 is in C: B < C.

If 5 in A: we can have:
A=5, B=4, C=3, D=2, E=1
A=5, B=4, C=2, D=3, E=1
A=5, B=3, C=4, D=2, E=1
A=5, B=3, C=2, D=4, E=1
A=5, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=1 (4 ways)
If 5 is in B
B is not possible.

Placing the numbers:
5 4 3
2
1
5 3 4
2
1
5 4 2
3
1
5 2 4
3
1
5 3 2
4
1

Possible ways:
1. A = 5, B=4, C=3, D=2, E=1
2. A = 5, B=4, C=2, D=3, E=1
3. A = 5, B=3, C=4, D=2, E=1
4. A = 5, B=3, C=2, D=4, E=1
5. A = 5, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=1

Answer: C)
Answer: C) 5
