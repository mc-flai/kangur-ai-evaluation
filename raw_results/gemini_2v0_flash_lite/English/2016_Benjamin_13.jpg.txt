Reasoning:
Let 'g' be the number of girls and 'b' be the number of boys.
We know g + b = 30.
Exactly half the girls share a desk with a boy, which means b = g/2 (as every boy shares a desk with a girl).
From the second equation, g = 2b.
Substitute g in the first equation: 2b + b = 30
3b = 30
b = 10

Answer: D)
