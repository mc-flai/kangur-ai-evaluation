Reasoning: The probability of getting a blue ball is calculated by dividing the number of blue balls by the total number of balls. We calculate the probability for each option and compare them:
*   **(A)** 10 / (10+8) = 10/18 = 0.555...
*   **(B)** 6 / (6+4) = 6/10 = 0.6
*   **(C)** 8 / (8+6) = 8/14 = 0.571...
*   **(D)** 7 / (7+7) = 7/14 = 0.5
*   **(E)** 12 / (12+9) = 12/21 = 0.571...

The highest probability is 0.6, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B)
