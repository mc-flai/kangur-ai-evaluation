Reasoning: The question asks which figure requires the least amount of color. This is the figure with the least surface area. We must compare the surface areas of the figures.
*   **(A)** A row of four cubes. The visible faces are front, back, top, bottom, and sides (2 sides per cube). There are 10 visible faces.
*   **(B)** A tower of 4 cubes. The visible faces are front, back, top, bottom, and sides. There are 18 visible faces (the sides of all four cubes).
*   **(C)** Three cubes in a row with one cube on top. Number of visible faces = 16
*   **(D)**  Two cubes side by side with the other two on top. Number of visible faces = 14
*   **(E)** Three cubes in a row with one cube on top. Number of visible faces = 14

The surface area depends on the number of visible faces. Since we are looking for the least amount of color, we need to find the smallest surface area. Option (A) has the fewest visible faces.

Answer: A)
