Reasoning:
A convex quadrilateral has all interior angles less than 180 degrees. We need to find the possible number of right angles (90 degrees) in such a quadrilateral.

*   **0 right angles:** A quadrilateral like a parallelogram or a trapezoid can have no right angles.
*   **1 right angle:** Possible.
*   **2 right angles:** Possible, for instance, a trapezoid with two right angles.
*   **3 right angles:** Possible. Example is an L shape
*   **4 right angles:** Possible. Example is a rectangle or a square.
* The list of possible values for *n* are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
