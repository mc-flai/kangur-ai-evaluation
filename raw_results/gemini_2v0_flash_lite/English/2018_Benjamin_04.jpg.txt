Reasoning: The slow snail crawls 1 m/h and the fast snail crawls 2 m/h. They start at the corner S and crawl in opposite directions. The perimeter of the garden is 6 units. Let's see how far each snail travels in an hour. The sum of their distances at time of meeting must be equal to half the perimeter of the garden as they travel in opposite directions. Let *x* be the distance the slow snail travels and *y* be the distance the fast snail travels when they meet. The sum of their travel distances is equal to the half of the perimeter in units. The meeting point is where *x* + *y* = 6/2 = 3.
*x* = 1 m/h * t (where t is time) and *y* = 2 m/h * t. We substitute *x* and *y* to find the time of their meeting point:
1*t + 2*t = 3 => 3*t = 3 => t = 1 hour.
So, the slow snail travels 1*1 = 1 unit. The fast snail travels 2*1 = 2 units.
The slow snail reaches point A, and the fast snail reaches point C. Therefore, the snails will meet at point C.

Answer: C)
