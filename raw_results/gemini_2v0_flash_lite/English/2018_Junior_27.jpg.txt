Reasoning: The problem describes a 3x3x3 cube with seven dice removed. When cut through the center, the shape is symmetrical, and we're looking at a cross-section. The removal of the seven dice creates a shape with three triangular holes on each side and one square in the center of the cross-section. The plane must pass through the center, perpendicular to the space diagonals. This will create a hexagon with a square hole in its center and four other points.

Answer: D)
