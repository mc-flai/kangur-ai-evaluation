Reasoning:
The given numbers are: 1572_, 22_, and 80_31. The sum is 57263. We can calculate the sum of the known digits:
1572_
022_
+80_31
-------
57263

1.  Summing the ones column: _ + 1 = 3, so the missing digit must be 2.
2.  Summing the tens column: 2 + 3 = 5, so the digit is 6. It's ok.
3.  Summing the hundreds column: 7 + _ + 0 = 2, so the missing digit must be 4 since the answer cannot be negative.
4.  Summing the thousands column: 5 + 2 + 8 = 15. We can see, the digits in question are, 2, 4, and 9, which sums up to 15.
Thus, the numbers are 15729, 224, and 80231.  15729 + 224 + 80231 = 57263
