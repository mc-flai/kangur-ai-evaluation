Reasoning: The question states that a number is smaller than its half (negative) and bigger than its double. This implies the number must be negative. Also, the sum of the number and its square is 0. Testing the answer options:
A) -2: -2 + (-2)^2 = -2 + 4 = 2 (incorrect)
B) -1: -1 + (-1)^2 = -1 + 1 = 0 (correct)
C) 0: 0 + 0^2 = 0 (but 0 is equal to its half and double, incorrect)
D) 1: 1 + 1^2 = 2 (incorrect)
E) 2: 2 + 2^2 = 6 (incorrect)
Answer: B)
