Reasoning: To solve the equation 2^(2x) = 4^(x+1), we can first rewrite the equation with the same base.  Since 4 = 2^2, we have 2^(2x) = (2^2)^(x+1). Simplifying the right side gives us 2^(2x) = 2^(2x+2).  Since the bases are equal, we can equate the exponents: 2x = 2x + 2.  Subtracting 2x from both sides gives 0 = 2, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no real solutions.
