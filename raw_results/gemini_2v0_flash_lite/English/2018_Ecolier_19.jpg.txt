Reasoning: Eva must enter the house, and move from rooms with increasing numbers. She can start from the room labeled with 12 (door A). Following the rule of increasing room numbers, she can take the path: 12 -> 14 -> 6 -> 10 -> 9. However, Eva must follow a path with increasing numbers, so this is not correct. Let's try 12 -> 14. From 14, she can go to 6 or to room 10. Since room 6 is smaller than 14 and does not satisfy the rule, we need to go to 10. Now, starting from 12, then 14, the possible paths are: 12 -> 14 -> 6 -> 8 -> 9 or 12 -> 14 -> 10 -> 9. The rule states that she can only go from rooms with a higher number than the previous one, we need to start again with 12 and then 14 -> 10. From 10, Eva can go to room 9. From 10 -> 9. Since this is the end of the path, Eva leaves the house through door E.
