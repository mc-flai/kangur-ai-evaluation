Reasoning:
Let's analyze the rubber band lengths. The diameter of each tube is 2 cm, so the radius is 1 cm.

**Left Picture:**
The rubber band covers the straight sections and the curved sections around the tubes.
*   There are 2 tubes side by side at the top and bottom, and 2 at the middle. The rubber band extends the horizontal sides.
*   The horizontal sides are 2*diameter + diameter = 2\*2 + 2 = 6 cm. The vertical sides are 2\*diameter = 2\*2 = 4 cm.
*   There are two rounded corners with arc-lengths that have lengths the sum of two arcs with degree 90. Which is equal to the circumference of one full circle with diameter 2cm. The arc length are 1*pi cm. Therefore the the additional curved length is equal to 2\*pi cm.
*   So, the total rubber band length is 6 cm + 2\*2 cm + 2\*pi cm = 10 cm + 2\*pi cm = 10 + 2*pi.

**Right Picture:**
*   The rubber band covers the straight sections and the curved sections.
*   The straight sections form an equilateral triangle with the tubes.
*   The length of one side of the outer triangle is 2\*diameter + diameter = 2\*2 + 2 = 6 cm.
*   There are three rounded corners. Each corner has arc-length corresponding to 1/3 of a circle with diameter 2 cm. The total additional curved length is equal to 2\*pi cm.
*   So, the total rubber band length is 3 \* 4 + 2\*pi = 12 + 2\*pi cm.
*   The difference in the rubber band lengths is (12 + 2\*pi) - (10 + 2\*pi) = 4.

Therefore the rubber band in the left picture is shorter than the right by 4 cm.
