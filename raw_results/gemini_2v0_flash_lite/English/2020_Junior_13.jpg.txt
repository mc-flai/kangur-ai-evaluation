Reasoning: The question asks for the distance from Betown to Atown. The first signpost on the left side of the road has "Betown 1 km". When returning from Cetown to Atown, we first see the sign "Betown 1 km". The right sign shows "Atown 6 km". The distance from Betown to Atown can be deduced by looking at the signs. Atown is 6 km away from Cetown.  Betown to Cetown = 9 km, then Betown to Atown would be 6 km - 1 km = 5km.
