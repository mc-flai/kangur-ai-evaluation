Reasoning:
1. From the first equation: The double-ring symbol plus the double-ring symbol equals the eye symbol. Since all digits are different (1-5) the result must be an even number.
2. From the second equation: The sun symbol plus the sun symbol equals the double-ring symbol. Since all digits are different (1-5) the result must be an even number, and it is the same as the double-ring symbol.
3. From the third equation: The sun symbol plus the eye symbol equals the many line symbol.
4. Let's make some assumptions and derive the equations. Let's assume that the sun symbol is 1. Then the double ring symbol is 2. Then the eye is 4. Then the many-line symbol is 5, and the fish is 3.

Therefore, the symbol for the digit 3 is the fish symbol.

Answer: E)
