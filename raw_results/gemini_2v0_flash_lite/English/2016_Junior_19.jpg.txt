Reasoning:
The image shows a cube with four marked angles. One angle is 90 degrees. The other three are formed by the corners of the cube. Each of these angles are formed from the intersection of 3 edges, and thus each measures 90 degrees. Thus, the sum of the four angles is 90 + 90 + 90 + 90 = 360 degrees.
