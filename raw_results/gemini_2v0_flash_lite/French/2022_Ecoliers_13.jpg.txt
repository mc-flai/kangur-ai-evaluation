Raisonnement : The question asks how many small triangles are needed to make the same square. In the image, there are a few small triangles. The key to solving this is to realize the relationship between the different triangle sizes. A medium triangle can be broken down to 2 small triangles and the large triangles can be split into 4 small triangles. By counting the number of small triangles in the original square we can solve this problem. The original square appears to be composed of 2 large triangles, 1 medium, and 4 small triangles. This will give us (2 * 4) + 2 + 4 = 8 + 2 + 4 = 16.

RÃ©ponse : C)
