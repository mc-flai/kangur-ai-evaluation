Raisonnement : The question asks which of the given shapes cannot be obtained by cutting out the six squares that make up the starting shape. We need to check whether we can rearrange the six squares to form each of the options.

*   **Starting Shape:** The starting shape is a "T" shape.
*   **A:** We can rearrange the squares to form shape A, it is possible to obtain this shape.
*   **B:** We can rearrange the squares to form shape B, it is possible to obtain this shape.
*   **C:** We can rearrange the squares to form shape C, it is possible to obtain this shape.
*   **D:** We can rearrange the squares to form shape D, it is possible to obtain this shape.
*   **E:** Shape E is a 2x3 rectangle.  We can rearrange the six squares to form shape E, it is possible to obtain this shape.

It seems all the options are possible to form with the six squares. It is important to note the question asks "which of the shapes **cannot** be obtained".

Let's look again at the starting shape, if we folded the shape as if we were making a box.  If we assume the bottom row of the T is the base, then the shape can only have 4 sides, so only one layer above.  Looking at the options, the only shape with 3 above layers is B.

Therefore, shape B is the shape that cannot be created.

RÃ©ponse : B)
