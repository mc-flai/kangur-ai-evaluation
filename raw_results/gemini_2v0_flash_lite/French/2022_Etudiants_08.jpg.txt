Raisonnement : The perimeter of the shaded region is composed of three arcs of circles. Each arc subtends an angle of $\frac{\pi}{3}$ radians. The radius of each circle is 1. The length of each arc is $1\cdot \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{\pi}{3}$. Since there are 3 arcs, the total perimeter $w = 3 \times \frac{\pi}{3} = \pi$.

RÃ©ponse : B)
