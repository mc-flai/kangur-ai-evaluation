1. **Identify the ages:** The ages of the cousins are 3, 8, 12, and 14.
2. **Divisibility by 5 for Zoé and Emma:** The sum of Zoé's and Emma's ages is divisible by 5.  Possible sums from the available ages are: 3+12=15 (divisible by 5). 8+12=20(divisible by 5), 8+14=22(not divisible by 5), 3+8=11(not divisible by 5), 3+14=17(not divisible by 5), 12+14=26(not divisible by 5).
3. **Divisibility by 5 for Raja and Zoé:** The sum of Raja's and Zoé's ages is divisible by 5. This means that both Emma and Raja's possible age are 8 and 14 or 3 and 12, and Zoé can only be 12 or 3.
4. **Determine Yves' age:** The only possible age for Yves is either 3, 8 or 14.

    *   If Zoe = 12 and Emma = 3, Raja = 8, then Yves= 14
    *   If Zoe = 3 and Emma = 12, Raja = 8, then Yves = 14
    *   If Zoe = 12 and Emma = 8, Raja = 3, then Yves = 14
    *   If Zoe = 8 and Emma = 12, Raja = 3, then Yves = 14
    *   If Zoe = 12 and Emma = 8, Raja = 14, then Yves = 3
    *   If Zoe = 8 and Emma = 12, Raja = 14, then Yves = 3

We can conclude that Yves's age can be 14 or 3 years old.  Since all possible solutions are shown in the options, and both choices A and D are possible, so we can not determine Yves' age.
