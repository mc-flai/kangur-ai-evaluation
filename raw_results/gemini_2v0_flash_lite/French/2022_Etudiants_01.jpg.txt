Raisonnement : 10^2022 is a 1 followed by 2022 zeros. 10^22 is a 1 followed by 22 zeros. When we add these, we have 100...000 + 100...00 where the second number ends in a 1 in the 23rd position from the right (counting from zero). The result will therefore be 100...0100...0, where there is a 1 in the 2023rd and the 23rd position. The sum of the digits is therefore 1+1 = 2.

RÃ©ponse : B)
