Reasoning:
The problem states that an equilateral triangle with side length 12 cm has the same perimeter as a square with side length x. We need to find the value of x.
The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 3 * 12 cm = 36 cm.
The perimeter of the square is 4 * x cm.
Since the perimeters are equal, we have 4 * x = 36.
Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 36 / 4 = 9.
