Reasoning: The question states that adjacent squares cannot have the same number. We need to check which of the options can be placed in the center without violating this rule. The center 2x2 square contains the numbers: 4, 3, 1, 2, 5, 5, 4, 2. After placing a piece in the center, we should avoid any repeating digits in adjacent boxes. Option A, 4, 1, 2, 3. The 1 and 2 in option A conflicts with the digits around the gap (specifically with 1 and 2 at the positions). Option B, 1, 3, 4, 2. The 3 and 2 in option B conflicts with the digits around the gap (specifically with 3 and 2 at the positions). Option C, 2, 4, 1, 3. Looks correct. No repetitions. Option D, 2, 3, 1, 4. The 3 and 4 conflicts with the digits around the gap (specifically with 3 and 4 at the positions). Option E, 3, 2, 1, 4. The 2, 1 and 4 conflicts with the digits around the gap. Since only C doesn't have adjacent repeating digits, it is the only possible solution.

Answer: C)
