Reasoning:
The question is asking who is sitting next to Charlie, given the following information:
1. Anne, Bilal, Charlie, Dom, and Enzo are sitting around a round table.
2. Anne is not next to Bilal.
3. Dom is next to Enzo.

Let's analyze the options:
A) Anne et Bilal: Incorrect, since Anne and Bilal cannot be next to each other.
B) Bilal et Dom: We can't confirm if Bilal sits near Charlie
C) Dom et Enzo: We can't confirm if Dom and Enzo sit near Charlie
D) Enzo et Anne: We can't confirm if Enzo and Anne sit near Charlie
E) On ne peut pas savoir: It is indeed difficult to know who sits besides Charlie.

Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot determine who is sitting next to Charlie.

Answer: E)
