Reasoning: The question asks for a counterexample to the statement: "If n is a prime number, then one and only one of the integers n-2 and n+2 is prime". A counterexample means we need to find a prime number n such that either both n-2 and n+2 are prime, or neither of them are prime.
Let's check each option:
A) n = 11: n-2 = 9 (not prime), n+2 = 13 (prime). Only one is prime, so it's not a counterexample.
B) n = 19: n-2 = 17 (prime), n+2 = 21 = 3*7 (not prime). Only one is prime, so it's not a counterexample.
C) n = 21: n=21 is not prime, so the conditional statement is vacuously true. Thus, it is not a counterexample.
D) n = 29: n-2 = 27 = 3*9 (not prime), n+2 = 31 (prime). Only one is prime, so it's not a counterexample.
E) n = 37: n-2 = 35 = 5*7 (not prime), n+2 = 39 = 3*13 (not prime). Neither is prime. Thus, this IS a counterexample because the statement says "one and only one" is prime.

Answer: E)
