Reasoning:
The question asks for the length of a side of an equilateral triangle that has the same perimeter as a triangle with sides 6 cm, 10 cm, and 11 cm.
First, we calculate the perimeter of the given triangle by adding the lengths of its sides: 6 cm + 10 cm + 11 cm = 27 cm.
Since an equilateral triangle has three equal sides, we can find the length of each side by dividing the perimeter by 3: 27 cm / 3 = 9 cm.

Answer: B)
