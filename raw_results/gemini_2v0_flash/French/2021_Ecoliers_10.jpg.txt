Reasoning: The question asks which two figures can be juxtaposed (placed side by side) to form a square.
Figure 1 is a right triangle with sides of 3 units and 3 units.
Figure 2 is a right triangle with sides of 2 units and 2 units.
Figure 3 is a right triangle with sides of 3 units and 3 units.
Figure 4 is a shape.
If we combine figure 2 and figure 4, we can create a square. The trapezoid is one unit taller than the triangle, and one unit narrower. Together the combined height and width are three squares, the same dimension as figures 1 and 3.

Answer: B)
