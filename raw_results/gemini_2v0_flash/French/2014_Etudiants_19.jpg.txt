Reasoning:
We are looking for integer triplets (m, n, p) such that 1 < p < n < m and 1/m + 1/n + 1/p > 1. Since p, n, and m are integers greater than 1, let's try small values for p, n, and m to see if we can find such triplets.

If p = 2, n = 3, then we need 1/m + 1/3 + 1/2 > 1, which means 1/m > 1 - 1/2 - 1/3 = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6.  Therefore, we need m < 6. Since n < m, 3 < m. Therefore, m can be 4 or 5. So we have (4, 3, 2) and (5, 3, 2) as solutions.

If p = 2, n = 4, then we need 1/m + 1/4 + 1/2 > 1, which means 1/m > 1 - 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4. Thus, m < 4. Since n < m, we have 4 < m which is a contradiction.

If p = 3, n = 4, then we need 1/m + 1/4 + 1/3 > 1, which means 1/m > 1 - 1/3 - 1/4 = 1 - 7/12 = 5/12. Thus, m < 12/5 = 2.4. Since n < m, 4 < m which is also a contradiction.

So far we have found two solutions: (4, 3, 2) and (5, 3, 2). Let's test p = 2, n = 3, m = 4.
1/4 + 1/3 + 1/2 = 3/12 + 4/12 + 6/12 = 13/12 > 1. This works.

Let's test p = 2, n = 3, m = 5.
1/5 + 1/3 + 1/2 = 6/30 + 10/30 + 15/30 = 31/30 > 1. This works.

Let's test p = 2, n = 3, m = 6.
1/6 + 1/3 + 1/2 = 1/6 + 2/6 + 3/6 = 6/6 = 1, which is not > 1.

So, based on the current analysis, we have found 2 triplets that satisfy the condition.
