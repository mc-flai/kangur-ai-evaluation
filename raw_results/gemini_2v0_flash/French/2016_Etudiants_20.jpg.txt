Reasoning: In a right triangle PQR, with the right angle at P, the angle bisectors of the acute angles Q and R intersect at K. The distance from K to the hypotenuse QR is given as $\sqrt{8}$.  Let this distance be $d$. Since K lies on the angle bisectors of angles Q and R, it is the incenter of the triangle PQR. The distance from the incenter to each side of the triangle is the inradius, $r$. Therefore, the distance from K to PQ and PR is also $r$. The distance from K to QR is given as $\sqrt{8}$, so $r=\sqrt{8}=2\sqrt{2}$. The coordinates of K are $(r,r)$ with respect to P. Thus, the distance from K to P is $\sqrt{r^2+r^2} = \sqrt{2r^2} = r\sqrt{2} = \sqrt{8} \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{16} = 4$.
