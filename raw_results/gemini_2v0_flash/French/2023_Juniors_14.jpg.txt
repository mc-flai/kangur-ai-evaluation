Reasoning: The question asks for the smallest possible integer average of five distinct prime numbers. To minimize the average, we should choose the five smallest distinct prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.
The sum of these numbers is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 = 28.
The average is 28 / 5 = 5.6. This is not an integer, so these five numbers don't work.

Let's try the next set of five smallest distinct prime numbers, where we replace 11 by 13. 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 13 = 30. The average is 30/5 = 6. Since 6 is an integer, and we've chosen the smallest possible distinct prime numbers to form an integer average, 6 must be the answer.
