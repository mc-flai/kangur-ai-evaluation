Reasoning:
Let's analyze the information given in the image. We have to place the numbers from 1 to 10 such that the sum of adjacent numbers is equal to the sum of diametrically opposite numbers.
The numbers are: 1, 2, 5, 9, 10 and a '?'.
Let the unknown number be $x$. The numbers that have values are at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10. Numbers are missing from positions 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. Let the positions be $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{12}$. Then $a_1=1, a_2=x, a_3=10, a_4=?, a_5=?, a_6=9, a_7=?, a_8=5, a_9=?, a_{10}=2, a_{11}=?, a_{12}=?$.
$a_i+a_{i+1}=a_{i+6}+a_{i+7}$ for $i=1,2,3,4,5,6$.

$a_1+a_2=a_7+a_8$
$1+x=a_7+5$
$a_2+a_3=a_8+a_9$
$x+10=5+a_9$
$a_3+a_4=a_9+a_{10}$
$10+a_4=a_9+2$
$a_4+a_5=a_{10}+a_{11}$
$a_4+a_5=2+a_{11}$
$a_5+a_6=a_{11}+a_{12}$
$a_5+9=a_{11}+a_{12}$
$a_6+a_1=a_{12}+a_7$
$9+1=10=a_{12}+a_7$

Now we can proceed by trying values for x from the options and finding the missing values.

If $x=3$,
$1+3 = a_7+5 \Rightarrow a_7 = -1$, not possible.
If $x=4$,
$1+4 = a_7+5 \Rightarrow a_7 = 0$, not possible.
If $x=6$,
$1+6 = a_7+5 \Rightarrow a_7 = 2$.
$6+10 = 5+a_9 \Rightarrow a_9=11$, not possible.
If $x=7$,
$1+7 = a_7+5 \Rightarrow a_7 = 3$.
$7+10 = 5+a_9 \Rightarrow a_9 = 12$, not possible.
If $x=8$,
$1+8 = a_7+5 \Rightarrow a_7 = 4$.
$8+10 = 5+a_9 \Rightarrow a_9 = 13$, not possible.

Let's assume that adjacent cells sum to the same amount *k*.
So $1+x = k$, $x+10=k$, so $1+x = x+10$, which is impossible.
It appears that the adjacent cells sum to the diametrically opposite cells.

$1 + x = ?$
$x + 10 = ?$
$9+5=?$

The sum of all 10 numbers is $\frac{10(11)}{2} = 55$.
$S = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10=55$.
Let $A+B = C+D$ for all pairs A, B which are neighbours and C,D are their diametrically opposite pair.
If we label the squares around the circle by a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j, then
a+b = f+g, b+c=g+h, c+d=h+i, d+e=i+j, e+f=j+a.
a=1, b=x, c=10, f=9, h=5, j=2.
$1+x = 9+g$, $x+10 = 5+i$,
$\sum = 55$

Reasoning:
Let's try another approach. Label the unknown values sequentially a,b,c,d,e,f.
So we have 1,x,10,a,b,9,c,5,d,2,e,f.
Now we have x+1 = c+5,
10+x = 5+d, a+10 = d+2,
a+b=2+e
b+9=e+f
9+1=f+c
Try A) x=3.
3+1=4 = 5+c -> c=-1 impossible.
Try B) x=4.
4+1=5 = 5+c -> c=0 impossible.
Try C) x=6
6+1 = 7 = 5+c -> c=2 impossible.
Try D) x=7
7+1=8 = 5+c -> c=3
10+7=17=5+d -> d=12 impossible.
Try E) x=8
8+1=9 = 5+c -> c=4
10+8=18=5+d -> d=13 impossible

Upon re-evaluation, I noticed I misread the question. It states that the sum of *two numbers* in neighboring cells *is* the sum of the two numbers in diametrically opposite cells. This requires us to consider two numbers in the unknown cells.
Let a be the cell where we need to fill the number, then $1+a=S$ and $a+10=S$. From this contradiction, adjacent cells must sum to the diametrically opposing cells.

Consider the case when $x=7$. Let adjacent sum = k.
Then adjacent sum k must be constant at 8+a where 'a' is cell to the right of 1. Let numbers be x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 x8 x9 x10 = 1, a, 10, b, c, 9, d, 5, e, 2.
1+a = c+5.

Let the numbers in the circle be a1, a2, ... a10. And let ai adjacent to ai+1 add up the the sum Ai. Where Ai = Aj Aj+1. The Ai also = sum across from Ai. The sum across being from x1= x6 and x2=x7; etc.
5+6 + 7+8 +9+10 = 35

There seems to be an error that doesn't allow any correct solution. No combination work in a systematic format as there can not be duplicate numbers.

Reasoning:
Let the numbers be $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_{10}$. We are given that the numbers from 1 to 10 must be used once.
We are also given $x_1=1, x_2=x, x_3=10, x_6=9, x_8=5, x_{10}=2$. The question states that adjacent cells sum to the same value such that if $x_i, x_{i+1}$ are neighbors and $x_j, x_{j+1}$ are diametrically opposite, then $x_i+x_{i+1}=x_j+x_{j+1}$.
The image positions the given numbers are : 1, x, 10, a, b, 9, c, 5, d, 2.
So, $1+x=5+d$, $10+x=2+d$,
$a,b,c,d$ must take on only the values: $3,4,6,7,8$.

Consider options as values of $'a'$.
$A=3, B=4, C=6, D=7, E=8$.
Thus when$x=4, b+a=1/2, c+d=1$. Thus x must be unique to this range.

The value $x+10=2+value4$. value4 range is not working.
As adjacent numbers $a$ and $b$ on opposite sides.

Reasoning:
$1 + x = 9 + value7 -> value7= x-8
x+10=5+(opposite+2) -> opposite x value for value1.
Try $7 +8$ as diametral.

I have been unable to come to an easy answer. Considering the original statement and re-analyzing it, I've found an issue in that the provided numbers do not follow the rule for their diametrically opposite numbers, there must be something wrong with the statement. Therefore i feel i cannot finish finding the correct result.

Answer: C)
