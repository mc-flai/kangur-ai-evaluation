Reasoning: Let's analyze the age relationships:
- Boby > Zina
- Lily > Boby
- Tom > Boby
Combining these, we have: Lily > Boby > Zina and Tom > Boby > Zina.
From this, we know Lily > Boby and Tom > Boby. So Boby cannot be the same age as Lily or Tom. This eliminates options B), D) and E).
Also, Lily is older than Zina, so they cannot have the same age. This eliminates option C).
The only possible answer is that Zina and Tom are the same age, but we cannot determine that Tom is older than Lily or Zina is older than Lily. Also, it's possible for Tom to have the same age as Zina, despite both being older than Boby.
So, we have the following:
- Lily > Boby
- Tom > Boby
- Boby > Zina

The only age relationship we can guarantee from this, is that Lily must be older than Zina. Therefore, Lily and Zina can not be the same age. Hence, C is an incorrect answer.

Consider the ages.
Boby > Zina
Lily > Boby
Tom > Boby

Option A) Zina and Tom: possible (ex: Lily=5, Tom=4, Boby=3, Zina=4)
Option B) Tom and Lily: impossible since Lily > Boby and Tom > Boby are unrelated so we can say that Lily may be older than Tom or the other way around
Option C) Lily and Zina: impossible since Lily > Boby > Zina, meaning Lily > Zina
Option D) Boby and Lily: impossible since Lily > Boby
Option E) Tom and Boby: impossible since Tom > Boby

Therefore, the answer is A.

Answer: A)
