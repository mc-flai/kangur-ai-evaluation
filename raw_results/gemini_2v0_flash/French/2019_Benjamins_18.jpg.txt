Reasoning:
Let 'n' be the weight of one black pearl and 'b' be the weight of one white pearl.
From the first balance, we have 2n = 3b + 6.
From the second balance, we have 2n + b = 30.
We can solve this system of equations. Since 2n = 3b + 6, we can substitute this into the second equation:
(3b + 6) + b = 30
4b + 6 = 30
4b = 24
b = 6
Now, substitute b = 6 into 2n = 3b + 6:
2n = 3(6) + 6
2n = 18 + 6
2n = 24
n = 12
Now we want to find the total weight of 4 black pearls and 3 white pearls, which is 4n + 3b.
4n + 3b = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66
However, 66 is not an option. There may be an error in my calculation or with the prompt.
Let's re-examine the given information and the equations.
The prompt is asking how much the seven pearls weight. We know that we have 4 black and 3 white pearls.
Let's look at the second balance. We know 2n+b=30
and we know from the first balance that 2n = 3b+6. We can substitute 2n into the second equation.

2n+b=30
(3b+6) + b = 30
4b + 6 = 30
4b = 24
b = 6

2n = 3b+6
2n = 3(6)+6
2n = 18+6 = 24
n = 12
So the total weight = 4*12+3*6
= 48 + 18 = 66

However, none of the options are 66 grams. I'll go with the closest answer: C) 68 g.
Looking at the options:
A) 54
B) 57
C) 68
D) 72
E) 80

Reasoning:
Let b = black pearl weight and w = white pearl weight.
From the first balance: 2b = 3w + 6
From the second balance: 2b + w = 30
We need to find 4b + 3w

From 2b + w = 30, w = 30 - 2b.
Substituting this into 2b = 3w + 6:
2b = 3(30 - 2b) + 6
2b = 90 - 6b + 6
8b = 96
b = 12

w = 30 - 2b
w = 30 - 2(12) = 30 - 24 = 6
Therefore 4b + 3w = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66

We seek value near 66, nearest is C) 68.

Reasoning:
Let b = weight of a black pearl, and w = weight of a white pearl.
Balance 1: 2b = 3w + 6
Balance 2: 2b + w = 30
Substitute 2b = 3w + 6 into the second equation:
(3w + 6) + w = 30
4w + 6 = 30
4w = 24
w = 6
Now substitute w = 6 into 2b = 3w + 6:
2b = 3(6) + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
b = 12
Total weight of 4 black and 3 white pearls = 4b + 3w = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66.

The closest value is C) 68g.

Reasoning:
Let $n$ be the weight of a black pearl and $b$ be the weight of a white pearl.
From the left balance, $2n = 3b + 6$.
From the right balance, $2n + b = 30$.
We want to find $4n + 3b$.
From the first equation, $2n = 3b + 6$.
Substituting into the second equation, $3b + 6 + b = 30$, so $4b = 24$, and $b = 6$.
Then $2n = 3(6) + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24$, so $n = 12$.
Therefore, $4n + 3b = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66$.
The closest answer is 68.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let the weight of a black pearl be 'x' and a white pearl be 'y'.
From the first balance: 2x = 3y + 6
From the second balance: 2x + y = 30

Substituting 2x = 3y + 6 in the second equation:
3y + 6 + y = 30
4y = 24
y = 6

2x = 3(6) + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
x = 12

Total weight of 4 black and 3 white pearls = 4x + 3y = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66.
Since 66 is not in the options, we choose the closest option.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let $b$ represent the weight of a black pearl and $w$ the weight of a white pearl.
From the first scale, $2b = 3w + 6$.
From the second scale, $2b + w = 30$.
Substituting the first equation into the second, we get $(3w + 6) + w = 30$, so $4w + 6 = 30$, which implies $4w = 24$, thus $w = 6$.
Substituting $w = 6$ into the first equation, we get $2b = 3(6) + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24$, so $b = 12$.
We are looking for the weight of 4 black pearls and 3 white pearls, which is $4b + 3w = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66$.

(3w + 6) + w = 30
4w + 6 = 30
4w = 24
w = 6
Substituting w = 6 into the first equation:
2b = 3(6) + 6
2b = 18 + 6
2b = 24
b = 12
We need to find 4b + 3w:
4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66
Since 66 is not an option, the closest is 68.

4w = 24
w = 6

Substituting w = 6 into Equation 1:
2b = 3(6) + 6
2b = 18 + 6
2b = 24
b = 12

We are looking for the total weight of 4 black pearls and 3 white pearls:
4b + 3w = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66

Since the answer of 66g is not among the choices, the closest value from among the given choices is 68.

y = 6
Substitute y = 6 into equation 1:
2x = 3(6) + 6
2x = 18 + 6
2x = 24
x = 12
Find the total weight 4x + 3y = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66
The answer closest to 66 is 68

From the first balance, we have: 2b = 3w + 6  --(1)
From the second balance, we have: 2b + w = 30 --(2)

Substitute (1) into (2):
3w + 6 + w = 30
4w + 6 = 30
4w = 24
w = 6

Substitute w = 6 into (1):
2b = 3(6) + 6
2b = 18 + 6
2b = 24
b = 12

Total weight of 4 black pearls and 3 white pearls: 4b + 3w = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66 g

Since 66 g is not an option, select the closest one which is 68 g.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let $x$ be the weight of a black pearl, and $y$ the weight of a white pearl.
From the first scale: $2x = 3y + 6$
From the second scale: $2x + y = 30$
We want to find $4x + 3y$.
Substitute $2x = 3y + 6$ into the second equation:
$3y + 6 + y = 30$
$4y = 24$
$y = 6$
Substitute this back into the first equation:
$2x = 3(6) + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24$
$x = 12$
So, $4x + 3y = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66$
The closest value to 66 from the given options is 68.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let b = weight of a black pearl and w = weight of a white pearl.
From the left balance: 2b = 3w + 6
From the right balance: 2b + w = 30
We want to find 4b + 3w.
From the second balance: 2b = 30 - w
Substitute this into the first balance: 30 - w = 3w + 6
24 = 4w
w = 6
Substitute w = 6 into 2b + w = 30:
2b + 6 = 30
2b = 24
b = 12
Therefore 4b + 3w = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66

Since 66 is not an option, we select the next closest which is C) 68.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let the weight of a black pearl be b and the weight of a white pearl be w.
From the first balance: 2b = 3w + 6
From the second balance: 2b + w = 30
Substituting 2b from the first balance into the second equation, we get:
3w + 6 + w = 30
4w = 24
w = 6
Substituting w=6 into 2b = 3w + 6
2b = 3(6) + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
b = 12
We want to find the total weight of 4 black pearls and 3 white pearls, so 4b + 3w.
4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66
Since this isn't an option, choose the closest.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let x = weight of one black pearl and y = weight of one white pearl.
From the first balance, we have 2x = 3y + 6.
From the second balance, we have 2x + y = 30.
Substituting 2x from the first equation into the second, we get (3y + 6) + y = 30.
This simplifies to 4y + 6 = 30, so 4y = 24, which means y = 6.
Substituting y = 6 back into the first equation, we get 2x = 3(6) + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24.
This means x = 12.
So we are looking for 4x + 3y = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66. Since this is not among the answers, the closest is chosen.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let b be the weight of one black pearl and w be the weight of one white pearl.
From the first scale: 2b = 3w + 6.
From the second scale: 2b + w = 30.
From the first equation, we get 2b = 3w + 6. Substitute into the second equation:
3w + 6 + w = 30
4w = 24
w = 6
Plugging w = 6 back into the first equation:
2b = 3(6) + 6
2b = 18 + 6
2b = 24
b = 12
We want to find 4b + 3w:
4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66.

Since 66 is not one of the options, the closest to 66 is 68.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:

Let b be the weight of a black pearl and w be the weight of a white pearl.
From the first balance: 2b = 3w + 6
From the second balance: 2b + w = 30

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
(3w + 6) + w = 30
4w + 6 = 30
4w = 24
w = 6

Now substitute w = 6 into the first equation:
2b = 3(6) + 6
2b = 18 + 6
2b = 24
b = 12

We want to find the total weight of 4 black and 3 white pearls which is:
4b + 3w = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66

As 66 is not available as an option, the closest available option is C) 68 g.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let 'b' represent the weight of a black pearl and 'w' represent the weight of a white pearl.
From balance 1: 2b = 3w + 6
From balance 2: 2b + w = 30
Substitute first equation in the second equation:
(3w + 6) + w = 30
4w = 24
w = 6
Substitute w = 6 into the first equation:
2b = 3(6) + 6 = 24
b = 12

Total weight of 4 black pearls and 3 white pearls = 4b + 3w = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66.

Closest answer to 66 is 68.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let b be the weight of a black pearl and w be the weight of a white pearl.
From the first scale, 2b = 3w + 6.
From the second scale, 2b + w = 30.
Substituting 2b = 3w + 6 in the second scale, we get 3w + 6 + w = 30
=> 4w = 24
=> w = 6
Using the first equation 2b = 3w + 6, putting w = 6, we get 2b = 3(6) + 6
=> 2b = 18 + 6
=> 2b = 24
=> b = 12
We have to find 4b + 3w = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66
However 66 is not among the options. The nearest option is C, 68.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let x = weight of one black pearl
Let y = weight of one white pearl
From the first equation: 2x = 3y + 6
From the second equation: 2x + y = 30

(3y+6) + y = 30
4y + 6 = 30
4y = 24
y = 6
2x = 3(6) + 6 = 24
x = 12
4 black pearls + 3 white pearls = 4x + 3y = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66
Since 66 is not one of the options, the closest number is C) 68

Substitute equation 1 into equation 2:
(3w + 6) + w = 30
4w = 24
w = 6
Substitute w = 6 into equation 1:
2b = 3(6) + 6
2b = 18 + 6
2b = 24
b = 12
Total weight = 4b + 3w = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66

Since 66 is not a choice the closet answer is 68

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let x = weight of a black pearl, y = weight of a white pearl
From the first balance equation: 2x = 3y + 6
From the second balance equation: 2x + y = 30

Substitute the value of 2x in the second equation:
3y + 6 + y = 30
4y = 24
y = 6

Substitute y = 6 in 2x + y = 30
2x + 6 = 30
2x = 24
x = 12

Therefore the total weight of 4 black and 3 white pearl is = 4x + 3y = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66
But since 66 is not available in the option we should pick closest to 66 which is C 68

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let 'b' be the weight of a black pearl and 'w' be the weight of a white pearl.  We can set up two equations based on the given information:

*  2b = 3w + 6
*  2b + w = 30

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

*  (3w + 6) + w = 30
*  4w + 6 = 30
*  4w = 24
*  w = 6

Now we can substitute w = 6 back into the first equation:

*  2b = 3(6) + 6
*  2b = 18 + 6
*  2b = 24
*  b = 12

We are asked to find the total weight of 4 black pearls and 3 white pearls, which is 4b + 3w.

*  4b + 3w = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66

Since 66 is not one of the options, we choose the closest available option, which is 68.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let b = weight of black pearl and w = weight of white pearl
From first balance : 2b = 3w + 6 ...(1)
From second balance : 2b + w = 30 ...(2)
Subtract (1) from (2), w - (3w + 6) = 30 - 2b - 2b
2b = 3w+6 so, (3w+6) +w =30
4w + 6 = 30
4w = 24
w = 6
Then 2b + 6 = 30 => 2b = 24 => b = 12
So Total weight = 4 black + 3 white = 4*12 + 3*6 = 48 + 18 = 66
Among given options, closest to 66 is 68

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let 'b' represent weight of black pearl and 'w' represent weight of white pearl
From the first balance, 2b = 3w + 6
From the second balance, 2b + w = 30
Substituting equation 1 in equation 2,
3w + 6 + w = 30
4w + 6 = 30
4w = 24
w = 6
Substituting w = 6 in first equation,
2b = 3*6 + 6
2b = 24
b = 12
Total weight of 4 black pearl and 3 white pearl
= 4*12 + 3*6 = 48 + 18 = 66 grams
closest is 68 grams

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let 'b' represent weight of a black pearl and 'w' represent weight of a white pearl
From the first balance: 2b = 3w + 6
From the second balance: 2b + w = 30
From the first equation: 2b = 3w + 6
Substituting this into the second equation, (3w + 6) + w = 30
This simplifies to 4w + 6 = 30
Hence 4w = 24, so w = 6
Using 2b + w = 30 and w = 6, then 2b + 6 = 30
This gives 2b = 24, so b = 12
We need to calculate the weight of 4 black pearls and 3 white pearls, which is 4b + 3w
4b + 3w = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66g.

Since 66 is not an option, the next closest option is C) 68 g

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let the weight of a black pearl be 'b' and that of a white pearl be 'w'.
From the first balance, we get 2b = 3w + 6
From the second balance, we get 2b + w = 30

Substitute for 2b in the second equation:
(3w + 6) + w = 30
4w + 6 = 30
4w = 24
w = 6
Then 2b = 3w + 6 = 3(6) + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24, so b = 12

Total weight of 4 black and 3 white pearls is 4b + 3w = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66

Of the choices given, 68 is the closest to 66.

2x + y = 30 ...(2)

Substitute the value of 2x from (1) into (2), we get:
3y + 6 + y = 30
4y = 24
y = 6

Substituting y = 6 into (1) we get:
2x = 3(6) + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
x = 12

Total weight of 4 black and 3 white pearls is:
4x + 3y = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66.

Substituting equation (1) into (2):
(3w + 6) + w = 30
4w + 6 = 30
4w = 24
w = 6

Substituting w = 6 into equation (1):
2b = 3(6) + 6
2b = 18 + 6
2b = 24
b = 12

The total weight of 4 black pearls and 3 white pearls is: 4b + 3w = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66.

The closest value is 68.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let b = weight of black pearl and w = weight of white pearl
2b = 3w + 6
2b + w = 30
(3w+6)+w=30
4w = 24
w = 6
2b = 3(6)+6
2b = 24
b = 12
Total = 4b+3w = 4(12)+3(6) = 48+18 = 66g.
Closest value is C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let 'b' be the weight of a black pearl and 'w' be the weight of a white pearl.
From the first balance: 2b = 3w + 6  ---(1)
From the second balance: 2b + w = 30 ---(2)

Substitute equation (1) into equation (2):
(3w + 6) + w = 30
4w + 6 = 30
4w = 24
w = 6

Substitute w = 6 back into (1):
2b = 3(6) + 6
2b = 18 + 6
2b = 24
b = 12

The total weight of 4 black pearls and 3 white pearls is 4b + 3w = 4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66

The closest answer choice is C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let b be the weight of a black pearl, and w be the weight of a white pearl.

From the first balance, 2b = 3w + 6.
From the second balance, 2b + w = 30.

Substitute 2b in the second equation:
3w + 6 + w = 30
4w = 24
w = 6.

Then, 2b = 3(6) + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24, so b = 12.

We want to find the total weight of 4 black pearls and 3 white pearls, which is 4b + 3w.
4(12) + 3(6) = 48 + 18 = 66.

However, 66 is not one of the options. The answer closest to 66 is C) 68.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let black pearl weight be x and white pearl weight be y.

From the first scale: 2x = 3y +
