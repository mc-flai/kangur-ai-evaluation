Reasoning:
The question asks which operation will yield the largest result when applied to a number between 10 and 100.

A) Dividing by 0.001 is the same as multiplying by 1000.
B) Dividing by 0.1 is the same as multiplying by 10.
C) Adding 1000 to a number between 10 and 100 will result in a number between 1010 and 1100.
D) Multiplying by 100 will result in a number between 1000 and 10000.
E) Multiplying by itself (squaring the number) will result in a number between 100 and 10000.

Comparing the operations, we can determine the largest result.

A) Multiplying a number between 10 and 100 by 1000 yields a number between 10000 and 100000.
B) Multiplying a number between 10 and 100 by 10 yields a number between 100 and 1000.
C) Adding 1000 yields a number between 1010 and 1100.
D) Multiplying by 100 yields a number between 1000 and 10000.
E) Squaring the number yields a number between 100 and 10000.

Operation A yields the largest range of numbers, so this will result in the highest result.
