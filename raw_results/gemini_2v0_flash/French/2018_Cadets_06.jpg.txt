Reasoning:
Let the radius of each circle be r. Since the circles are tangent to three sides of the rectangle with dimensions 7 x 11, the diameter of each circle is 7, so the radius is 7/2 = 3.5. Let the centers of the two circles be C1 and C2. The coordinates of C1 can be taken as (3.5, 3.5) and the coordinates of C2 as (11-3.5, 3.5) = (7.5, 3.5). Then the distance between the two centers is 7.5 - 3.5 = 4.
The distance between the centers of the two circles is 4.
