Reasoning: The length of the diagonal segment is inversely proportional to the height of the triangle with a given area. The height of the triangle is inversely proportional to the length of the diagonal segment. Thus, the larger the area of the triangle, the longer the segment. Given areas are 2, 5, 9 and 4 cm^2. So the segment associated to the 9cm^2 will be the longest, that is segment 'd'.

Answer: D)
