Reasoning: The staircase has 2023 steps. Every third step is black. Quentin alternates between his right and left feet. We want to find how many black steps he puts his right foot on. First, we calculate the number of black steps: 2023 / 3 = 674.333... so there are 674 black steps (since we take the integer part). Now, since he alternates feet, roughly half of these black steps will be stepped on by his right foot. Since he starts with his right foot, and the first black step is the 3rd step, his right foot will be on black steps 3, 9, 15, ... (3+6k), and his left foot will be on black steps 6, 12, 18,... (6k). Therefore, his right foot steps on black steps 3, 9, 15, ..., 3+6k <= 2023. 3+6k <= 2023 => 6k <= 2020 => k <= 2020/6 => k <= 336.666.... So k can be any integer from 0 to 336. This means there are 337 possible values for k, which implies there are 337 black steps that are stepped on with the right foot.
