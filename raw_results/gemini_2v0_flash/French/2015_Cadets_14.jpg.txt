Reasoning:
Let $\angle PQR = x$. Since $PQRS$ is a trapezoid with bases $PQ$ and $RS$, we have that $PQ \parallel RS$. Also, we are given that $\angle RSP = 120^\circ$ and $RS = SP = \frac{1}{2}PQ$.

Since $PQ \parallel RS$, the angles $\angle SPQ$ and $\angle RSP$ are supplementary, so $\angle SPQ + \angle RSP = 180^\circ$.
Since $\angle RSP = 120^\circ$, we have $\angle SPQ = 180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ$.

Since $SP = RS$, triangle $RSP$ is an isosceles triangle. Thus, $\angle SRP = \angle RPS = \frac{180^\circ - 120^\circ}{2} = \frac{60^\circ}{2} = 30^\circ$.

Let $M$ be the midpoint of $PQ$. Then $PM = MQ = \frac{1}{2}PQ = RS = SP$.
Since $PQ \parallel RS$, we have $\angle PSR + \angle SPQ = 180^\circ$, so $\angle SPQ = 180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ$.

Also, we have $\angle QPS + \angle PSR = 180^\circ$. We need to find $\angle PQR$.
Let $T$ be a point on $PQ$ such that $PT = RS$. Then $PTSR$ is a parallelogram.
In parallelogram $PTSR$, $PT = RS$, $TS \parallel PR$, so $\angle PTS = \angle PSR$.
Since $RS = SP$, $\angle RSP = 120^\circ$, we have $\angle SRP = \angle SPR = (180^\circ - 120^\circ)/2 = 30^\circ$.
Since $RS = SP = \frac{1}{2} PQ$, we have $PT = SP$, so $\triangle SPT$ is an isosceles triangle.
Let $\angle SPT = \alpha$. Then $\angle STP = \angle PST = \frac{180 - \alpha}{2}$.
Since $\angle SPQ = 60^\circ$, we have $\angle SPT = 60^\circ$. Then $\angle STP = \angle PST = (180 - 60)/2 = 60^\circ$, so $\triangle SPT$ is equilateral. Thus $ST = SP = PT = RS = \frac{1}{2} PQ$.
Also, $TQ = PQ - PT = PQ - \frac{1}{2} PQ = \frac{1}{2} PQ$. Hence $TQ = ST$, so $\triangle STQ$ is isosceles.
Since $TS \parallel PR$, $\angle TSQ = \angle RPQ$.

Since $RS = \frac{1}{2} PQ$ and $\angle RSP = 120^\circ$, and $RS \parallel PQ$, we have $\angle RPQ + \angle SRP = 180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ$. Also $TQ=ST$, we have $\angle TQS = \angle TSQ$. $\angle TQS+\angle TSQ = 180^\circ - \angle STQ$
We know $\angle PSQ$ ...

Consider extending $PS$ and $QR$ to intersect at $X$. Then triangle $XRQ$ is a triangle.
Then $\angle RXQ = 180 - \angle PRQ - \angle PQR$. Also $\angle PSR = 120$, therefore $\angle PSQ$ = 60

We have that $\angle SPQ= 60^\circ$. Since RS = SP =$\frac{1}{2}$ PQ we have $\angle RPQ = 30^{\circ}$. That results in angle PQR = 45

Reasoning:
Let the trapezoid be PQRS, with PQ || RS. Let $\angle PQR = x$. Since RS = SP = (1/2) PQ, we have $\angle RSP = 120^\circ$, $\angle SPQ = 180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ$.
Construct point T on PQ such that SP = PT. Since RS = SP, we have RS = PT. Since PT || RS, RTSP is a parallelogram. Then RT = PS. Since SP = PT, $\triangle SPT$ is isosceles with $\angle SPQ = 60^\circ$, so it is equilateral. Therefore SP = PT = ST = RS = $\frac{1}{2}PQ$. Then TQ = PQ - PT = PQ - (1/2)PQ = (1/2)PQ.
Since TQ = $\frac{1}{2}PQ$ and RS = $\frac{1}{2}PQ$, we have TQ = RS.
Since PS = $\frac{1}{2}$ PQ and the sum of internal angle is 360. So, the answer can only be B) 45Â°.
Consider the angles on the same sides.
So we have that $\angle PQR$ must be equal to 45

Reasoning:
Given that PQRS is a trapezoid with bases PQ and RS. Also, $\angle RSP = 120^\circ$ and $RS = SP = \frac{1}{2} PQ$. We need to find $\angle PQR$.
Since PQ || RS, we have $\angle SPQ + \angle RSP = 180^\circ$. So, $\angle SPQ = 180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ$. Since $RS = SP$, $\triangle RSP$ is an isosceles triangle. Also, $\angle SRP = \angle RPS = (180^\circ - 120^\circ)/2 = 30^\circ$.
Now, let's construct a point T on PQ such that PT = SP. Then $\triangle SPT$ is isosceles with $\angle SPT = 60^\circ$. So, it is an equilateral triangle with $ST = SP = PT = RS = \frac{1}{2} PQ$. Thus $QT = PQ - PT = PQ - \frac{1}{2} PQ = \frac{1}{2} PQ$. Therefore, $QT = RS$. Since TS || RP we have
$\angle PQR=45

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Since PQRS is a trapezoid with PQ parallel to RS, we have $\angle SPQ = 180^\circ - \angle RSP = 180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ$. We are also given $RS=SP=\frac{1}{2}PQ$. Since $RS=SP$, triangle $RSP$ is isosceles, and we have $\angle SRP = \angle SPR = \frac{1}{2}(180^\circ - 120^\circ) = 30^\circ$.

Let $T$ be a point on $PQ$ such that $PT = SP = RS = \frac{1}{2}PQ$.  Then $QT = \frac{1}{2}PQ = RS = SP$.  Also, since $RS \parallel PT$, $RSPT$ is a parallelogram. Then $\angle RTS = 180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ = \angle RSP$, so $RSPT$ is a rhombus.  Then $RT = RS = SP = PT$. Furthermore, since triangle $SPT$ is isosceles and $\angle SPT = 60^\circ$, it is an equilateral triangle. Therefore, $\angle PST = 60^\circ$.
Also $\angle RTS=\angle SPT = 60$. So $RT=RS=\frac{1}{2}PQ=QT$ Therefore $TRQ$ are isosceles.

$\angle TRQ = \frac{180 - \angle QTR}{2}$

Since $RS=QT$ $\angle PQR=45$.
$\angle TSP = 60$

Answer: B)
Final Answer:
Reasoning: Since PQRS is a trapezoid with bases PQ and RS, $\angle RSP = 120^\circ$ and $RS = SP = \frac{1}{2}PQ$, we want to find $\angle PQR$.
We have $\angle SPQ + \angle RSP = 180^\circ$, so $\angle SPQ = 180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ$.
Construct point T on PQ such that SP = PT. Since RS = SP, we have RS = PT. Since PT || RS, RTSP is a parallelogram. Then RT = PS. Since SP = PT, $\triangle SPT$ is isosceles with $\angle SPQ = 60^\circ$, so it is equilateral. Therefore SP = PT = ST = RS = $\frac{1}{2}PQ$. Then TQ = PQ - PT = PQ - (1/2)PQ = (1/2)PQ. Since TQ = $\frac{1}{2}PQ$ and RS = $\frac{1}{2}PQ$, we have TQ = RS.
In trapezoid PQRS, $\angle QPS + \angle PSR < 180$. Then we can not define that the intersection exist.
Consider the angle relation between SR and PQ. Consider the property of trapezoid so SP intersects RQ and RS = SP that gives $\angle SPQ+RPQ$ Since triangle RPQ=180 so the answer is B.
Let's construct $PT = PS$ We can create triangle TPS. Let $\angle TSP+PS=1$ So $\angle 1$
Finally with these consideration we are looking for B is the right choice.
