Reasoning:
The given transformation is (x, y) -> (1/x, 1/y).
The square K has vertices (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2).
Applying the transformation to these vertices:
(1, 1) -> (1/1, 1/1) = (1, 1)
(2, 1) -> (1/2, 1/1) = (0.5, 1)
(2, 2) -> (1/2, 1/2) = (0.5, 0.5)
(1, 2) -> (1/1, 1/2) = (1, 0.5)
The transformed figure will have vertices at (1, 1), (0.5, 1), (0.5, 0.5), (1, 0.5). This suggests a shape similar to option A. As x increases in the interval [1,2], 1/x decreases, and similarly for y.
The sides will become curved and the new figure will be a distorted version of the original square. Based on this logic, the closest match among the options is A.

Answer: A)
