Reasoning:
Suzy can choose between giraffe, elephant and turtle (3 choices) to feed. The animal that the soigneur feeds can be any of the four, but it can't be the same as the one Suzy fed, plus we know Suzy cannot feed the lion, so the soigneur can feed the lion.
If Suzy chooses the giraffe, the soigneur can feed the lion, elephant or turtle (3 choices).
If Suzy chooses the elephant, the soigneur can feed the lion, giraffe or turtle (3 choices).
If Suzy chooses the turtle, the soigneur can feed the lion, giraffe or elephant (3 choices).
Therefore, there are 3 * 3 = 9 possible choices.
