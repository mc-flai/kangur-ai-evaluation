Reasoning:
Let $v$ be the number of vertical rods and $h$ be the number of horizontal rods.
The barrier starts and ends with a vertical rod. There are 4 horizontal rods between each consecutive vertical rod.
Thus, if there are $v$ vertical rods, there are $v-1$ gaps, each containing 4 horizontal rods. Thus $h = 4(v-1)$.
The total number of rods is $v + h = v + 4(v-1) = v + 4v - 4 = 5v - 4$.
We need to find which of the options A, B, C, D, or E can be written in the form $5v-4$ for some integer $v$.
If $5v - 4 = 95$, then $5v = 99$, $v = 99/5 = 19.8$, which is not an integer.
If $5v - 4 = 96$, then $5v = 100$, $v = 20$, which is an integer.
If $5v - 4 = 97$, then $5v = 101$, $v = 101/5 = 20.2$, which is not an integer.
If $5v - 4 = 98$, then $5v = 102$, $v = 102/5 = 20.4$, which is not an integer.
If $5v - 4 = 99$, then $5v = 103$, $v = 103/5 = 20.6$, which is not an integer.
Therefore, the only possible total number of rods is 96.
