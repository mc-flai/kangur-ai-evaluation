Reasoning:
First, find the number of successful shots out of the first 20 attempts: 20 * 0.55 = 11.
Then, find the total number of shots after the additional five attempts: 20 + 5 = 25.
Next, find the total number of successful shots after all 25 attempts: 25 * 0.56 = 14.
Finally, subtract the number of successful shots in the first 20 attempts from the total number of successful shots: 14 - 11 = 3.
