Reasoning: The question asks which square has the largest black area.
A) Has 2 black squares and 2 white squares. The black area is 2/4 or 1/2 of the total area.
B) Has 5 black squares and 4 white squares. The black area is 5/9.
C) Has 5 black squares and 4 white squares. The black area is 5/9.
D) Has 8 black squares and 8 white squares. The black area is 8/16 or 1/2 of the total area.
E) Has 7 black squares and 8 white squares. The black area is 7/15.

To compare the fractions:
1/2 = 0.5
5/9 = 0.555...
7/15 = 0.466...
Therefore, C and B have the largest black area.

Reasoning: Count the number of black squares in each.
A) 2 black squares, 2 white squares. So black area = 1/2.
B) 5 black squares, 4 white squares. So black area = 5/9 = 0.55...
C) 5 black squares, 4 white squares. So black area = 5/9 = 0.55...
D) 8 black squares, 8 white squares. So black area = 1/2.
E) 7 black squares, 8 white squares. So black area = 7/15 = 0.46...

Since the black area is the same for B and C, but C has the largest overall percentage of black area given the total amount of squares. Thus, C has the largest area of the five options.

Answer: C)
