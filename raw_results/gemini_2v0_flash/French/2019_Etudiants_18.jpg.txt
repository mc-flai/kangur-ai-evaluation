The question asks for the set of real numbers k for which the equation x^2 + 4x = k has two distinct real solutions for x.
We can rewrite the equation as x^2 + 4x - k = 0. This is a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = 4, and c = -k.
For the quadratic equation to have two distinct real solutions, the discriminant must be greater than 0. The discriminant is given by Δ = b^2 - 4ac.
In this case, Δ = 4^2 - 4(1)(-k) = 16 + 4k.
We need Δ > 0, so 16 + 4k > 0.
Dividing by 4, we get 4 + k > 0, which implies k > -4.
Therefore, the set of real numbers k for which the equation has two distinct real solutions is ]-4; +∞[.

Reasoning: We need to find the values of k for which the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots. This is determined by the discriminant being greater than 0. We calculate the discriminant and solve the inequality.
