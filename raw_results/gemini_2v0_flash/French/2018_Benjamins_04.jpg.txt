Reasoning: The question asks how many cars are going towards Kangouville after exiting the intersection. We need to count the number of cars whose direction matches the direction indicated by the Kangouville sign.
- The cars arriving from the left and continuing straight are going towards Kangouville. There are 3 such cars.
- The car arriving from the bottom and turning right is going towards Kangouville. There is 1 such car.
So, a total of 3 + 1 = 4 cars are going to Kangouville.
