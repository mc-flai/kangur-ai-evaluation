Reasoning: The question states that Noah wrote four consecutive two-digit integers, but he replaced the usual digits with symbols. We are given the first three numbers: square-triangle, heart-cross, heart-square. Let's try to figure out the underlying numerical progression. Since they are consecutive, the difference between each number is 1.
If square-triangle is 'n', then heart-cross is 'n+1' and heart-square is 'n+2'.
Since the second number is 'n+1', and we are going from square-triangle to heart-cross, it suggests that the 'triangle' is one less than 'cross' since the first number is 'n'.
So, we have:
square-triangle = n
heart-cross = n+1
heart-square = n+2
The next number would be n+3, which means the second number must increment again to n+3. This requires a change in the first number of the number n+3. Since we already have square, heart, and triangle, we can exclude square and heart from occupying the next number.
Since the given numbers are consecutive, the numbers must increment. Looking at the options, we are looking for the next integer in the sequence. Since the current sequence ends with "heart-square," the next number in the sequence would be "heart-heart."
