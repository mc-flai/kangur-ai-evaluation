Reasoning:
First, count the area of the black squares and the grey squares. The black area is 3 + 1/2 = 3.5 squares. The gray area is 4 + 1/2 = 4.5 squares. Therefore the difference in area is 4.5 - 3.5 = 1 square. The grey area exceeds the black area by 1 square. To make the areas equal we must add a fully black square to the area indicated by the question mark.
Answer: B)
