Reasoning: The question asks for the number at the question mark in the wheel. We need to follow the operations in the wheel to determine the missing number.
Going backwards from the question mark, we see the previous number is multiplied by 0. Therefore the number at the question mark can be any number.
Starting from the top, let's try working forwards to find the value. Let the top value be `x`. The values will follow the sequence:
x, 4x, 4x-15, 4x-15+4, (4x-11)*0, (4x-11)*0+6. Since the starting and ending numbers are the same, we know that x = (4x-11)*0+6. We can deduce that x = 6.
Then the numbers will be: 6, 24, 9, 13, 0, 6.
So the number at the question mark is 0. But 0 isn't an answer choice. This could be a typo in the question.

Let's go through the steps again. Let's define the numbers as follows:
a * 4 = b
b - 15 = c
c + 4 = d
d * 0 = e
e + 6 = a

We know that d * 0 is always 0. Hence e = 0. Then a = e + 6, so a = 6.
a * 4 = 6 * 4 = 24 = b
b - 15 = 24 - 15 = 9 = c
c + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13 = d
d * 0 = 13 * 0 = 0
So, the number right before the multiplication by 0 is 13. The question mark is therefore 0. Since this isn't an answer, let's reconsider.

Going in reverse order, the question mark is multiplied by 0 to get the next value, so regardless what the number at the question mark is, it will always be 0 after multiplying by 0. Because the next operation after that one is adding 6, the starting number in the wheel must be 6.

Going back to the question now, let's try to use the reverse order.
We start with a question mark, multiply by 0, then add 6 to obtain 6. So the original sequence is as such.

Let A be the starting point on top, so we have the following wheel sequence:
A
4A
4A - 15
4A - 15 + 4
0*(4A - 15 + 4) = 0
0 + 6 = 6

So now A must be 6.
6
24
9
13
0
6
So the answer is 0. But this option does not exist in the answer choices.
Let's assume the operations must continue in the same order. That means the value at the question mark is the last one to be multiplied by 0, and then we add 6. And the question mark is not A or 6. If so, we have:

x * 0 = 0
0 + 6 = A
So A is 6.
Let's work it backwards:
Let x be the question mark.
x = 0 * (number before it)
Then the sequence is
A
4A
4A - 15
4A - 15 + 4 = 4A - 11
0 = x
6 = A
But it still doesn't fit since A = 6.
Let's re-examine the question for typos and errors.

Since 0 times anything is 0, the step right before the multiplication of 0 will give you what the question mark should be equal to. From our work above, we get 13, as that number is multiplied by zero to get the next number in the series. Therefore 13 should be the answer.
