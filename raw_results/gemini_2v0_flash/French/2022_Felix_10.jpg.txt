Reasoning:
We are given a five-digit number where each digit has a shape associated with it, and different digits have different shapes. The same digit has the same shape.
Looking at the shapes, the heart, diamond, club, and spade shapes are all different, and a single shape appears in three positions. This means we are looking for a number where one digit is repeated three times.

Now we look through the options:
(A) 34426 - The digit 4 is repeated twice. This is incorrect.
(B) 34526 - The digit 6 is repeated twice. This is incorrect.
(C) 34423 - The digit 4 is repeated twice and 3 repeated twice. This is incorrect.
(D) 34424 - The digit 4 is repeated three times. Also, there are five digits: 3, 4, 2, and 4. So all of the conditions are met.
(E) 32446 - The digit 4 is repeated twice. This is incorrect.

Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

Answer: D)
