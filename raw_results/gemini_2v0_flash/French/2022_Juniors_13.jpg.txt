Reasoning:
1. Calculate the time it takes for the rabbit and hedgehog to meet. Their relative speed is 10 + 1 = 11 m/s. The distance is 550 m, so the time to meet is 550 / 11 = 50 seconds.
2. When they meet, the rabbit is at a distance of 10 * 50 = 500 m from the starting point. The hedgehog is at a distance of 1 * 50 = 50 m from the starting point.
3. The hedgehog turns around and chases the rabbit. The rabbit continues running towards the starting point, which is 500 m away. The time it takes for the rabbit to reach the starting point is 500 m / 10 m/s = 50 seconds.
4. During this time, the hedgehog chases the rabbit. The hedgehog's speed is 1 m/s. Since the rabbit is already at the starting point, the hedgehog needs to cover the 50 m from the meeting point to the starting point. The time it takes for the hedgehog to reach the starting point is 50 m / 1 m/s = 50 seconds.
5. Therefore, the rabbit arrives at the starting point and waits for 50 seconds for the hedgehog to arrive.
