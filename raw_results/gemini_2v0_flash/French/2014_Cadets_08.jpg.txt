Reasoning: A cube with side 3 has a volume of 3 * 3 * 3 = 27. Gaëtan already has 7 cubes. So, he needs 27 - 7 = 20 more cubes. However, none of the answers correspond with this result. Let me double check my calculations. A cube with a side length of 3 requires 3*3*3 = 27 unit cubes. Gaëtan has 7 cubes. 27 - 7 = 20. None of the listed solutions are correct.

Let me consider there is a typo, and options D and E are provided in the options, but not visible in the image.
Reasoning: The volume of a cube of side 3 is 3^3 = 27. Gaetan has 7 cubes already. Therefore, he needs 27 - 7 = 20 additional cubes. Since 20 is not one of the options, it must be an error. Without the values of options D) and E), the problem can't be solved. However, if we estimate the number of missing cubes by carefully analyzing the drawing, and using common sense, we can determine if answers A, B, and C are reasonable. None of them seem to be appropriate since they are smaller than 20.

It could be that Gaetan has 7 cubes and he needs to put them in such a way that he can add other cubes and arrive to a cube with side 3. The original image can also be interpreted as Gaetan needs to *move* the 7 cubes from the arrangement they are right now into a proper 3x3x3 cube. However, the questions mentions the word "supplementaires" which in english means "supplementary" and it reinforces the idea that he needs more cubes.
Reasoning: After careful consideration of the problem statement and the available options, I have determined that none of the answer choices provided are correct. The correct answer should be 20.

Answer: None of the above
