Reasoning:
We are given the equation $8^k = 2^k \times 2^{12}$. We can rewrite $8$ as $2^3$, so the equation becomes $(2^3)^k = 2^k \times 2^{12}$. Using the power of a power rule, we have $2^{3k} = 2^k \times 2^{12}$. Using the product of powers rule, we have $2^{3k} = 2^{k+12}$. Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other: $3k = k+12$. Subtracting $k$ from both sides, we get $2k = 12$. Dividing both sides by 2, we get $k = 6$.
