Reasoning:
The question says that a pyramid has 23 triangular faces. This means that the base is a 23-sided polygon (23 sides).
The number of edges of the pyramid is the number of edges on the base plus the number of edges connecting the base to the apex. The base has 23 edges. There are 23 edges connecting the base to the apex. Therefore, the total number of edges is 23 + 23 = 46.
