Reasoning: The question asks for the number of squares after unfolding. The square is folded in half twice. This gives four layers. Each layer has a square. Then the top left corner is cut off and the top right corner is cut off. After unfolding there are four layers. These four layers of the cut corners mean there are actually four squares. The middle where the paper was folded in half is also intact so this is one square as well. Since it is two folds it means there is one layer in the top left, top right, bottom left, and bottom right layers. So the number of square is actually equal to one large square in the middle and four small squares on the corners. The square in the middle that is unfolded is the actual square shape without any of the top left and right corner cuts. Therefore there are 5 squares when it is unfolded.
