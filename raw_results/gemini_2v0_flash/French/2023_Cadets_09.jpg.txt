Reasoning: The 4x6 rectangle has an area of 24. We need to find the shape that cannot tile the rectangle without overlapping or leaving gaps. The area of the rectangle is 24. If a shape can tile it, the area of the shape must divide 24.
A) Area = 4. 24/4 = 6. Possible.
B) Area = 4. 24/4 = 6. Possible.
C) Area = 4. 24/4 = 6. Possible.
D) Area = 4. 24/4 = 6. Possible.
E) Area = 4. 24/4 = 6. Possible.
However, if we try to tile with E, it is impossible without gaps or overlaps. So we must check the shapes again. The rectangle is a 4x6 rectangle. We must select one of the shapes, which is impossible to tile a rectangle with only using this shape. By trying to use these shapes on the rectangle, it can be seen that E would not be able to tile the rectangle because it's a straight line and there is no way to create a rectangular shape using only this shape without leaving gaps or overlaps.

Answer: E)
