Reasoning: Let's analyze each option:
A) "Un seul d'entre nous dit la vérité" (Only one of us is telling the truth). If the elf said this, it would be true, implying the troll is lying. If the troll said this, it would be a lie, implying both are telling the truth or both are lying. But the elf always tells the truth and the troll always lies, so the troll is lying. If the troll is lying, it means that not only one is telling the truth. So, the elf must be telling the truth which aligns with the initial statement. So A is a possible option.
B) "Je mens toujours" (I always lie). If the elf said this, it would be a lie, contradicting the fact that the elf always tells the truth. If the troll said this, it would be a lie, contradicting the fact that the troll always lies. So, option B cannot be the answer.
C) "Tu dis la vérité" (You are telling the truth). If the elf said this, it would mean the troll is telling the truth, which is a contradiction. If the troll said this, it would mean the elf is lying, which is a contradiction. So option C cannot be the answer.
D) "Je dis la vérité" (I am telling the truth). If the elf said this, it would be true, which is consistent. If the troll said this, it would be a lie, which is consistent. But since they both are saying the same sentence at the same time, then option D cannot be true.
E) "Nous disons tous les deux la vérité" (We are both telling the truth). If the elf said this, it would mean the troll is telling the truth, which is a contradiction. If the troll said this, it would mean that the elf is lying, which is a contradiction. So, option E cannot be the answer.

Therefore, option A is the only plausible solution.

Answer: A)
