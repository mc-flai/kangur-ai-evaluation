Reasoning: The question asks which of the five given patterns cannot be made using exactly five of the given pieces. Each piece is a 1x2 rectangle. Therefore, any shape that is not made up of 10 squares can be eliminated. All the given patterns are made up of 10 squares. We must visualize arranging the given 1x2 piece to form each pattern.
Pattern A) can be formed using five pieces.
Pattern B) can be formed using five pieces.
Pattern C) can be formed using five pieces.
Pattern D) cannot be formed using five pieces. If you place a piece in the top left corner horizontally, the remaining configuration requires two isolated stars which are not adjacent, which is impossible. Similarly, placing the piece in the top left corner vertically also leads to configurations that are not possible.
Pattern E) can be formed using five pieces.

Answer: D)
