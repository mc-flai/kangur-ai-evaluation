Reasoning:
We are given that it is a direct elimination tournament with matches from the quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final. There are 6 results given and we want to know the missing one. The given results are:
1. Téa a battu Sam
2. Uzi a battu Vic
3. Yin a battu Zoé
4. Yin a battu Uzi
5. Uzi a battu Téa
6. Wan a battu Xiu
The players involved are Téa, Sam, Uzi, Vic, Yin, Zoé, Wan, Xiu. In a direct elimination tournament, if there are matches from the quarter finals, semi finals and final, there are a total of 7 matches (for an 8 player tournament). Since 6 matches are given and we're looking for the 7th, we want to find which of the options would make sense for a tournament bracket.
Let's analyze the tournament bracket:
- Téa beat Sam
- Uzi beat Vic
- Yin beat Zoé
- Wan beat Xiu
These are the quarter final matches (4 matches). Then,
- Yin beat Uzi.
- Uzi beat Téa

If Yin beat Uzi, Uzi can't beat Téa. This is a direct contradiction and suggests that we have to look at possible winners from the quarter finals to continue on to the next rounds.
Possible pairings for semi finals based on the listed wins in the quarter finals:
Téa vs Uzi, Yin vs Wan.
Based on the given info, Uzi beat Téa, and Yin beat Uzi. Hence, the first pairing resulted in Uzi winning.
Wan beat Xiu and Yin beat Zoé, then Yin might play Wan in the second semi final.
The semi final pairing resulted in Yin winning against Wan.

So now, we have that Uzi and Yin are the finalists. Yin beat Uzi.
The possible final result among the options is that Yin beat Wan.
We examine the elimination tree.

Quarter-finals:
Téa beat Sam
Uzi beat Vic
Yin beat Zoé
Wan beat Xiu

Semi-finals:
Uzi beat Téa (implying Uzi and Téa were in the same side of the bracket)
Yin beat Wan (implying Yin and Wan were on the same side of the bracket)

Final:
Yin beat Uzi
The given information includes : Téa beat Sam, Uzi beat Vic, Yin beat Zoé, Yin beat Uzi, Uzi beat Téa, Wan beat Xiu
The proposed result we're considering: Yin beat Wan.
The missing result is then: Yin beat Wan.
So we are looking for the semi final round. After winning in the quarter finals round:
Téa, Uzi, Yin, Wan.
Semi finals match: Yin vs Wan and Téa vs Uzi
Semi finals result: Yin beat Wan and Uzi beat Téa
Finals match: Yin vs Uzi
Finals result: Yin beat Uzi.

So Yin beat Wan should fit in the semi final round.

Answer: E)
Final Answer: E)
