Reasoning: The image shows a pattern of triangles forming a larger triangle. By observing the structure, we can deduce that the completed triangle would have a base and height of 5 small triangles each. A complete triangle in this pattern would have a total of 5*5 = 25 individual triangles. The current shape is made up of 8 triangles. The number of additional triangles is 25 - 8 = 17.
