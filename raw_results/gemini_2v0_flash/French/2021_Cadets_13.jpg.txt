Reasoning:
The large square has an area of 16 cm², meaning each side has a length of 4 cm. There are four small squares, each with an area of 1 cm², meaning each side has a length of 1 cm.
Each shaded region consists of two triangles. The triangles are right-angled triangles, and their legs are 1 cm and 1 cm. Thus, the area of one of these right-angled triangles is (1/2) * 1 * 1 = 0.5 cm².
Since each shaded region consists of two triangles, the area of one shaded part is 2 * 0.5 cm² = 1 cm².
There are four identical shaded regions in the diagram. Therefore, the total area of the shaded regions is 4 * 1 cm² = 4 cm².
