Reasoning: The question asks how many swaps of gray and white tiles are needed to make the pattern symmetrical from all four sides.
The image shows that the arrangement of tiles is currently not symmetrical with respect to all four sides. The four corners should have the same color. Currently, two corners have grey tiles, and two have white tiles.
If we swap two gray tiles in the corner with two white tiles in the corner, then all four sides would show the same pattern. So, two exchanges of gray and white tiles is needed to make the view from each of the four sides of the room the same.
