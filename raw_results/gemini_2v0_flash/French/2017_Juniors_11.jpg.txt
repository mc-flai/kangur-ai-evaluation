Reasoning: The disk has radius 1 and rolls along a segment of length 9π. The circumference of the disk is 2πr = 2π(1) = 2π. Since the disk rolls a distance of 9π, the number of complete rotations is 9π / 2π = 4.5. This means the disk makes 4 and a half rotations.

The starting configuration has the gray sector at the top. After one full rotation, the gray sector will be at the top again. After four full rotations, the gray sector will still be at the top. After an additional half rotation (180 degrees), the sector that was at the bottom will now be at the top. Looking at the initial configuration, the white sector is at the bottom. Therefore, after 4.5 rotations, the white sector should be at the top.

The answer that shows the white sector at the top is option D.

Answer: D)
