Reasoning:
Let M be the midpoint of HU and N be the midpoint of GO.
We are given that HG = 12 and UO = 18.
We want to find the distance MN.
Let H = 0. Then U > 0, G > U, and O > G.
Since HG = 12, G = H + 12 = 0 + 12 = 12.
Since UO = 18, O = U + 18.
M is the midpoint of HU, so M = (H + U) / 2 = (0 + U) / 2 = U/2.
N is the midpoint of GO, so N = (G + O) / 2 = (12 + U + 18) / 2 = (U + 30) / 2.
MN = |N - M| = |(U + 30) / 2 - U / 2| = |(U + 30 - U) / 2| = |30 / 2| = 15.
The distance between the midpoints of HU and GO is 15 cm.
