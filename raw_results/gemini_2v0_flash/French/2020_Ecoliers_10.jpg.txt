Reasoning: Let the mass of a cat be 'x'. On the left side of the balance, we have a 5kg weight, a 2kg weight, and two cats. So the total weight on the left is 5 + 2 + 2x = 7 + 2x. On the right side, we have a 3kg weight and three cats. So the total weight on the right is 3 + 3x.
Since the balance is in equilibrium, the weights are equal:
7 + 2x = 3 + 3x
Subtract 2x from both sides:
7 = 3 + x
Subtract 3 from both sides:
x = 4
Therefore, the mass of a cat is 4kg.
