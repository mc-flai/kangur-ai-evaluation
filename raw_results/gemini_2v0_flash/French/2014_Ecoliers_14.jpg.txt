Reasoning: We want to find the minimum number of swaps to transform the word "RAGNUUKOO" to "KANGOUROU".
Let's write both words aligned and look at what needs to be swapped:

R A G N U U K O O
K A N G O U R O U

1. Swap R and K: KARNGUUOO
2. Swap G and N: KANGRUGOO
3. Swap G and R: KANGURGOU
4. Swap G and O: KANGOUROU

Thus we need 4 swaps in total.

Answer: C)
