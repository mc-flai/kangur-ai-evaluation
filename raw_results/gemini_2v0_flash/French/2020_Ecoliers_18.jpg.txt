Reasoning: Let the three numbers be $x, y, z$. We have $x+y+z = 50$. Let the secret number be $a$. Then $x-a=24$, $y-a=13$, $z-a=7$. Adding these three equations, we have $x+y+z-3a = 24+13+7 = 44$. Since $x+y+z = 50$, we have $50-3a = 44$. Thus, $3a = 50-44 = 6$, and $a=2$. Therefore, $x = 24+a = 24+2 = 26$, $y = 13+a = 13+2 = 15$, and $z = 7+a = 7+2 = 9$. The original numbers are $26, 15, 9$. From the options, 9 is one of the original numbers.
