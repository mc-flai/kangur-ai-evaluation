Reasoning:
The figure shows the constructed cube with small cubes. We need to figure out how many more cubes are needed to complete a larger cube.
First, count how many cubes are already present in the figure. The figure has a base of 3x3=9 cubes, and a tower of 3 cubes on top of one of the base cubes. Therefore, the number of cubes present = 9+3 = 12.
Next, observe the shape of the construction. We can deduce that a 3x3x3 cube is being built.
A 3x3x3 cube has 3*3*3 = 27 cubes in total.
The number of additional cubes needed is 27-12 = 15.
Therefore, Edgar needs to add 15 more cubes.
