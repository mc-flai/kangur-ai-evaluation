Reasoning: The functions are f(x) = x^2 (a parabola opening upwards) and g(x) = -2x (a straight line). We need to find the intersection points to see how the plane is divided.
x^2 = -2x
x^2 + 2x = 0
x(x + 2) = 0
So the intersection points are x = 0 and x = -2. This means that the parabola and the straight line intersect at two points. A parabola and a line that intersect at two points will divide the plane into 4 regions.

Answer: B)
