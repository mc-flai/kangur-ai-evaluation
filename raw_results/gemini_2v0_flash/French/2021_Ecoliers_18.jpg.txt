Reasoning: Let's analyze the given information:
1. The heart is on case 1.
2. The rooster is not on case 5.
3. The crown is next to the castle and the flower.

Since the heart is on case 1, the other symbols can be on cases 2, 3, 4, or 5.
If we label the positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
heart is on position 1.
rooster is NOT on position 5.
The crown is adjacent to the castle and the flower.

This means the castle, crown, and flower must be together and in that specific order, since the crown is next to the castle AND next to the flower. The question is asking us for the location of the crown, so we look for where the crown is. If we have the pattern castle, crown, flower, and since position 1 is taken, our pattern can be only 2,3,4 or 3,4,5.

Consider the positions 2, 3, and 4. If we place the pattern in these positions:
2: Castle
3: Crown
4: Flower

Then the question is asking for the position of the crown. This implies the answer is 3.

Consider the positions 3, 4, and 5. If we place the pattern in these positions:
3: Castle
4: Crown
5: Flower

The rooster is not on position 5, and the flower is on position 5, so the rooster isn't the flower.

Thus, the position of the crown is 3 or 4. Since the crown is next to the castle and flower, it must be located at positions 2-4, so it's the crown at 3. Or positions 3-5, so it's the crown at position 4. Let's assume the first, then rooster would be on position 5. Then let's suppose the other pattern, then rooster could be at position 2. Thus, we can't distinguish the value.

Consider the order. The crown is next to the castle AND the flower. It's in that order as well.
So the order must be castle-crown-flower. Therefore, they can be at 2-3-4, or 3-4-5.
So the crown must be either at 3 or 4. Since the rooster isn't on 5, and the heart is at 1, we can't determine the rooster position.

Let's just assume 2-3-4. Then the crown is at 3.
Let's just assume 3-4-5. Then the crown is at 4.
If crown at 3, then castle at 2, flower at 4, and rooster at 5 (not allowed).

So it must be:
3 castle
4 crown
5 flower
Rooster at 2. So the crown is at 4.

Reasoning: Heart is at position 1. Crown is adjacent to the castle and flower. The rooster isn't at position 5. So the arrangement has to be Castle-Crown-Flower. They could be at position 2, 3, and 4, respectively or at 3, 4, and 5.
If they are at positions 2, 3, 4, the rooster would have to be at position 5, but we know this isn't true. So this cannot be correct.
Therefore, they have to be positions 3, 4, and 5. So:
3 = castle
4 = crown
5 = flower
Then the rooster must be at position 2.
