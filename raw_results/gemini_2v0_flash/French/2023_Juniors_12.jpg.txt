Reasoning: Let the length of the first piece be $x$. Then the length of the second piece is $x + 0.5x = 1.5x$, and the length of the third piece is $1.5x + 0.5(1.5x) = 1.5x + 0.75x = 2.25x$. The total length of the cable is 76 m, so we have the equation $x + 1.5x + 2.25x = 76$. This simplifies to $4.75x = 76$. Dividing both sides by 4.75 gives $x = \frac{76}{4.75} = \frac{76}{\frac{19}{4}} = \frac{76 \cdot 4}{19} = 4 \cdot 4 = 16$.
The first piece is 16 m. The second piece is $1.5 \cdot 16 = 24$ m. The third piece is $2.25 \cdot 16 = \frac{9}{4} \cdot 16 = 9 \cdot 4 = 36$ m.
The length of the longest piece is 36 m.
