Reasoning: The question asks which graph best represents the diameter of the remaining roll as the length of the paper unrolled increases.
Initially, the diameter is large. As the cat unrolls more paper, the diameter decreases. The rate of decrease isn't constant. Initially, when the roll is large, unrolling a certain length of paper removes only a small layer, so the diameter decreases slowly. As the roll gets smaller, unrolling the same length of paper removes a larger layer, so the diameter decreases more rapidly. Therefore, the graph should be decreasing, with a faster rate of decrease as x increases. This means the curve should be concave up. Option E is the best representation of this behavior.

Answer: E)
