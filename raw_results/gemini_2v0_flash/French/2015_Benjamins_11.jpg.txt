Reasoning:
Let L be the length of one paper strip.
When two strips are joined together with a 10 cm overlap, the total length is 50 cm.
Therefore, L + L - 10 = 50
2L = 60
L = 30 cm.
Now, Ã‰liane wants to join two other strips (each of length 30 cm) to obtain a length of 56 cm.
Let the overlap be x cm.
Therefore, L + L - x = 56
30 + 30 - x = 56
60 - x = 56
x = 60 - 56
x = 4 cm
