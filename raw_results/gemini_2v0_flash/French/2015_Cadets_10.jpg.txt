Reasoning:
The question states that there are no two boys born on the same day of the week, and no two girls born in the same month of the year. Adding one more student would break one of these rules. There are 7 days in a week, so there can be a maximum of 7 boys. There are 12 months in a year, so there can be a maximum of 12 girls. Adding one student means that 7 boys + 12 girls = 19 students total. If there are 19 students, adding one more student (the 20th) would break one of the rules.

Answer: B)
