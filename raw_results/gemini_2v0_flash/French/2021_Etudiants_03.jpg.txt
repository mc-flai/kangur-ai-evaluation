Reasoning:
The question asks us to find the graph that corresponds to the temperature data: -1, -4, 0, 0, 3, -3, -5. The graph should have the following properties:
1. Starts near zero (-1).
2. Goes down to -4.
3. Goes up to 0.
4. Stays at 0.
5. Goes up to 3.
6. Goes down to -3.
7. Goes down to -5.
Looking at the graphs, only graph E matches these properties.

Answer: E)
