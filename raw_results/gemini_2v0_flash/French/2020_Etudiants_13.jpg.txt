Reasoning: Let's analyze the problem: We have four identical parallelepipeds. One parallelepiped requires 1 liter of paint to cover all 6 faces. The structure is made up of these blocks glued together. We need to calculate how many liters are needed to paint the entire structure.
If the blocks were separate, we would need 4 liters of paint. However, because the blocks are attached, some faces are hidden. Let's count how many faces are hidden due to gluing.
- Block 1 is glued to block 2, so 1 face is hidden.
- Block 2 is glued to block 1 and block 3, so 2 faces are hidden.
- Block 3 is glued to block 2 and block 4, so 2 faces are hidden.
- Block 4 is glued to block 3, so 1 face is hidden.
So in total, there are 1+2+2+1 = 6 faces hidden. Since each parallelepiped has 6 faces, this means we have 4*6 - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18 faces to be painted.
We know that 6 faces need 1 liter, therefore 18 faces need 18/6 = 3 liters.
