Reasoning:
First, let's find Zinzin's final position relative to the starting point. Zinzin goes 1 km North, 2 km West, 4 km South, and 1 km West.  So, Zinzin's net displacement is (1 - 4) km South and (2 + 1) km West, which is 3 km South and 3 km West.

Next, let's find Harrant's position relative to the starting point. Harrant goes 1 km East, 4 km South, and 4 km West. So, Harrant's net displacement is (1 - 4) km West and 4 km South, which is 3 km West and 4 km South.

To rejoin Zinzin, Harrant must travel from his current position (3 km West, 4 km South) to Zinzin's position (3 km West, 3 km South). Thus, Harrant needs to travel 1 km North to align his north-south position with Zinzin.
