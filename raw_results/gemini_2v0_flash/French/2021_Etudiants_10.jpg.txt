Reasoning: The equation of a line is generally given by y = mx + k, where m is the slope and k is the y-intercept. From the graph, the line has a positive slope and a positive y-intercept.
The parabola is given by y = ax^2 + bx + c. The constant term, c, represents the y-intercept of the parabola.

Now we examine the possible line equations:
A) y = bx + c
B) y = cx + b
C) y = ax + b
D) y = ax + c
E) y = cx + a

From the graph, the line has a positive slope and a positive y-intercept. We need to see which options satisfy this.

In the parabola equation y = ax^2 + bx + c, the parabola opens upwards. This implies that a > 0.

In the given choices, the coefficients a, b, and c could be positive or negative. We need to determine the signs based on the parabola graph. Since the vertex of the parabola is to the left of the y-axis and the parabola opens upwards (a > 0), we know that -b/2a > 0. Since a > 0, then -b > 0, so b < 0. The parabola intersects the y-axis at a positive value, which means c > 0.
The straight line goes through the y-axis above zero and has positive slope.

Consider y = ax + b.  Since a > 0 and b < 0, this is not the correct graph.  We can eliminate choice C.
Consider y = bx + c.  Since b < 0 and c > 0, this is not the correct graph.  The line should have a positive slope.

Consider the option D: y = ax + c.  Here, a > 0 and c > 0. Therefore, the slope is positive, and the y-intercept is positive. This corresponds to the drawn line.

Consider E: y = cx + a.  Here, c > 0 and a > 0. Therefore, the slope is positive and the y-intercept is positive, which is also in line with the graph. Since we are told a, b and c are distinct values, if a and c are positive, they may be greater than or less than each other and greater than 0. Thus, the graph can be that of E.

Since it's possible to see options D and E can work depending on the relative magnitudes of a, c and a respectively, let us examine other options. Since b < 0 and c > 0 the slope will be negative and y-intercept will be positive. Options A and B will produce negative slope. Options C, D and E yield a positive slope. We know a,b and c are distinct, and a>0, c>0 and b < 0. Considering option A, it will have a negative slope.

The only reasonable match seems to be D, where the coefficient of x is a (positive) and y-intercept c (also positive).

Answer: D)
