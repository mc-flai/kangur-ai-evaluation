Reasoning:
The question states that two adjacent discs (discs that are connected by a line) must have different colors. We want to find the minimum number of colors needed to color the entire diagram.
The central disc is connected to 6 other discs. Thus, all 6 discs surrounding the central disc must have colors different from the central disc. Also, since the discs on either side of the central disc form a chain, it is possible to use only one color.
Let's try to see if 2 colors are enough. If we color the center disc with color 1, then all 6 discs connected to it must have color 2. However, the two bottommost discs are also connected to each other and thus need to be of different colors. Therefore, two colors are not enough.
Now, let's consider if 3 colors are sufficient. Color the central disc with color 1. Color the two discs on top with color 2. The two discs on the right and left with color 3. The two discs on the bottom with colors 2 and 3. Since the last two bottom discs are connected, we need different colors, therefore 3 colors are not enough.
Try coloring the central disc with color 1. The 6 discs connected to it must be different than the color 1. We can use two other colors (color 2 and color 3) to alternatingly color the six surrounding discs. But we notice that the bottom two discs are connected to each other. Therefore, we can color these discs with different colors, using color 2 and color 3, alternating, but not both the same. We color the central disc with color 1. The two top discs with color 2. The left and right discs with color 3. The bottom discs with colors 2 and 3 alternatively. But since these are connected by a line, they must have different colors.
We can color the central disc as color 1. Then the discs on top, left, right, bottom need colors different than 1.
The two top discs can alternate colors between 2 and 3. The two side discs need different colors, which we can do with colors 2 and 3 as well. But then the two bottom discs are connected, so their colors can be different from color 1, and different from each other. So use colors 2 and 3. Therefore, we can use 3 colors.

Let us analyze the graph more closely. We can color the central disc with color 1. The top two discs can be colored with color 2. The left and right discs can be colored with color 3. But the bottom discs are connected. If the two bottom discs are colored with colors different from color 1, for example, color 2 and 3. Then we need 3 colors. If the 2 top discs are color 2, the left and right are 3, we cannot use color 2 at the bottom, or color 3 at the bottom. Therefore, we will need an additional color, thus 3 is not enough.
If we look at the central vertex and two adjacent vertices, we need 3 colors to color them. Now, let's see if we can use 3 colors.

Let the center be 1. Top left be 2. Top right be 3. Then left is 3. Right is 2. Then bottom left is 2 and bottom right is 3. But those are connected. Thus, we need at least 3 colors.

If we pick the central node, and one of its adjacent neighbor, and *that* neighbor's adjacent neighbor, the graph formed is isomorphic to the diagram. We can form several isomorphic trees. Thus, we will need 3 colors.

We need to find a coloring such that no two adjacent discs have the same color.

If the central node is color 1, then the adjacent nodes cannot be color 1. So we need 2 or 3. If we have 2 colors, then all adjacent have color 2. However, the bottom ones are connected. If we have 3 colors, then center is 1. Top left and top right alternate between 2 and 3. Left and right also do. But bottom ones are connected and cannot be the same.

In this case, we have two nodes connected to the center. The neighbors are connected to two nodes, including the center node.
The chromatic number of a bipartite graph is 2. That means we can only use two colors.
This is not a bipartite graph.

We need 3.
