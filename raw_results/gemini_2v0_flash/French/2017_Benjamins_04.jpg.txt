Reasoning:
To prevent any passage between islands S and T, we need to cut off all possible paths. We can visually trace the paths:
1. S -> island above S -> island to the right -> island below -> T. This path requires closing 3 bridges.
2. S -> island to the left -> island below -> T. This path requires closing 3 bridges.

We need to find the minimum number of bridges to close. We can try to close bridges that are part of multiple paths.
From S, there are two bridges. From T, there are two bridges connecting it to the islands.
If we remove 2 bridges, it doesn't stop all possible paths, so we need to remove more than 2.
We can also manually count the paths between S and T. There are two distinct paths, and each path involves at least three bridges. The question asks for the minimum number of bridges to close to stop any passage between S and T. We need to close one bridge from each path. So, 3 bridges seem to do it.

Let's redraw the graph and try to remove 2 bridges and see if we can still travel from S to T. It is possible to draw a path from S to T using only 3 bridges. Therefore, closing 2 bridges is not enough.
We can close 3 bridges and isolate the path from S to T. This means the answer is 3.
