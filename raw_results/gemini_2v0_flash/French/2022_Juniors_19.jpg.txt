Reasoning:
The question states that the two types of *zarmus* are positive and negative.
Positive *zarmus* only ask questions that have "yes" answers.
Negative *zarmus* only ask questions that have "no" answers.
Stein asks "Are Albert and I both negative?".
If Stein is positive, then the answer to this question would be "yes", meaning Albert and Stein are both negative, a contradiction.
If Stein is negative, then the answer to this question would be "no". Then, either Albert is positive or Stein is positive (or both). Since Stein is negative, then Albert must be positive.
Therefore, Albert is positive and Stein is negative.
