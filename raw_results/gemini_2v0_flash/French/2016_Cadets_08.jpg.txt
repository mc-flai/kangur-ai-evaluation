Reasoning: The rectangle is 20 cm x 10 cm. The total area is 200 cm². By visual inspection, it seems that half the rectangle is shaded. Hence, the shaded area is 100 cm². Alternatively, we can notice that the rectangle contains 2 columns of similar patterns. Each column has a width of 10 cm. Each column contains two half circles, which together make a full circle with diameter 10 cm. That circle contains the area shaded. Thus, in each column half is gray and half is white, meaning half of the area is gray.
