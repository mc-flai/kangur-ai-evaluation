Reasoning:
The question asks which of the views (A-E) cannot be a view of the cube with the ribbon.
A) A plain square could represent a view where the ribbon is on the sides or back, out of view. This is possible.
B) An X can be formed if we view the cube such that we are seeing two corners on a plane in front of us.
C) A backslash can be seen from a particular angle.
D) A forward slash can be seen as well.
E) is not possible as this ribbon would have to connect to the corner.

Answer: A)
