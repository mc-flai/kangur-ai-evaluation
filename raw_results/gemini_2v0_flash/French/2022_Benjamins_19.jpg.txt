Reasoning:
The volume of water remains constant.
In the first case, the volume of water is $4 \times 2 \times 0.25 = 2 \, m^3$ (25 cm = 0.25 m).
In the second case, the area of the base is $1 \times 2 = 2 \, m^2$.
Let $h$ be the height of the water in the second case. Then the volume of water is $1 \times 2 \times h = 2h \, m^3$.
Since the volume of water is constant, $2h = 2$, so $h = 1 \, m$.
