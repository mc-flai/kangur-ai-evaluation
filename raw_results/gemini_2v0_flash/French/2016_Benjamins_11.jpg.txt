Reasoning:
Squirrel A is closest to the first nut on the left.
Squirrel B is closest to the second nut from the left.
Squirrel C is closest to the nut between B and D.
Squirrel D is closest to the nut between C and E.
Squirrel E is closest to the last nut on the right.
After Squirrel C grabs its first nut, the next closest nut is to the left, already taken by Squirrel B. So squirrel C will go to the right and take D's nut.
After Squirrel D grabs its first nut, the next closest nut is to the right, already taken by Squirrel E.

Squirrel B has already taken the nut nearest to it, so that one is not an answer, same goes for Squirrels A, D and E.

So, Squirrel C is the answer.

Answer: C)
