Reasoning:
Let the width of the rectangle be 'w' and the length be 'l'.
From the figure, we can see that the side of the square is formed by the length of the rectangle and the width of the rectangle, or three widths of the rectangle. Therefore, we have:
l + w = 36 and 3w = 36 => w = 12 cm
Substitute w=12 cm in the first equation, l + 12 = 36 => l = 36 - 12 = 24 cm
Area of the rectangle = l * w = 24 * 12 = 288 / 6 = 48 cm².
Since we have 6 rectangles in the square and want to find the area of one rectangle, we also know that 6*area = 36 *36.
Therefore, the are of one rectangle = (36*36) / 6 = 6 *36 = 216 / 6 = 48 cm².
