Reasoning:
The question asks for the sum of all digits written on the cards. Lola has 20 cards with 22 written on them, and 22 cards with 20 written on them.
For the 20 cards with 22 written on them, the sum of the digits is 20 * (2+2) = 20 * 4 = 80.
For the 22 cards with 20 written on them, the sum of the digits is 22 * (2+0) = 22 * 2 = 44.
The total sum of the digits is 80 + 44 = 124.

Answer: B)
