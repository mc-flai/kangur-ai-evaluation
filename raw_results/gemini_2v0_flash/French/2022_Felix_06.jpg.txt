Reasoning: The question asks us to identify the animal which uses a shape that is unique to it.
Let's analyze the shapes used in each animal:
- Animal A (Rabbit): Contains a square. Squares also exist in the shape of animal C (Bird).
- Animal B (Kangaroo): Contains a large triangle and a parallelogram. Large triangles exist also in animal C, and parallelograms exist in animal E (Cat).
- Animal C (Bird): Contains a square, a large triangle, and a small triangle that can also be seen in the rest of the animals. It also contains a shape that looks like an irregular quadrilateral. Looking at the options this "arrow" shape is unique to this figure.
- Animal D (Dog): Contains triangles and parallelograms.
- Animal E (Cat): Contains a parallelogram and triangles.

Animal C has a shape that is not present in the other animals.

Answer: C)
