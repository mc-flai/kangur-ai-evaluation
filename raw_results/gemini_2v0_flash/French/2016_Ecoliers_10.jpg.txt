Reasoning:
First, let's count the number of each shape in the figure:
- Circles: 3
- Squares: 1
- Triangles: 2

Now let's check each option:
A) "Il y a autant de cercles que de carrés." (There are as many circles as squares.) - False, because there are 3 circles and 1 square.
B) "Il y a moins de cercles que de triangles." (There are fewer circles than triangles.) - False, because there are 3 circles and 2 triangles.
C) "Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles." (There are 2 triangles and 2 circles.) - False, because there are 3 circles.
D) "Il y a plus de carrés que de triangles." (There are more squares than triangles.) - False, because there is 1 square and 2 triangles.
E) "Il y a 2 fois plus de cercles que de triangles." (There are 2 times more circles than triangles.) - False, since 3 is not twice 2. But "2 fois plus" actually means 2 times more, so 3 times as many. So this statement should be interpreted as the number of circles being twice *more* than the number of triangles. Let's rephrase: The number of circles is the number of triangles *plus* two times the number of triangles, so: 3 = 2 + 2*2 = 2+4=6. This isn't true. My mistake.
The statement in D) is definitely the closest thing to true, although inverted.
What if the statement in E) actually means "There are two more circles than triangles?" 3 = 2 + 1. Still False.
There must be a typo somewhere, and there isn't a way to know where.
The statement C) is wrong about the number of circles, there are 3. Let's assume there was a typo and that there are actually 3 circles, then that statement would be wrong about the number of triangles.
We'll stick to the statement which describes the figures the best, that is, "There are fewer circles than triangles" (statement B).

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let's count the shapes:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Now, analyze the options:
A) There are as many circles as squares: False (3 circles, 1 square)
B) There are fewer circles than triangles: False (3 circles, 2 triangles)
C) There are 2 triangles and 2 circles: False (2 triangles, 3 circles)
D) There are more squares than triangles: False (1 square, 2 triangles)
E) There are 2 times more circles than triangles: False (This would mean 2 * 2 = 4 circles)

None of the options are correct. However, the statement in C is closest. The number of triangles is correct, and the error on the number of circles is the smallest (only one away).

I suspect there is a mistake, so it will be safest to assume the question is badly written, and select the closest matching statement.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Shapes in the image:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Evaluate the options:
A) "Il y a autant de cercles que de carrés." (There are as many circles as squares.) - False
B) "Il y a moins de cercles que de triangles." (There are fewer circles than triangles.) - False
C) "Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles." (There are 2 triangles and 2 circles.) - False
D) "Il y a plus de carrés que de triangles." (There are more squares than triangles.) - False
E) "Il y a 2 fois plus de cercles que de triangles." (There are 2 times more circles than triangles.) - if this means twice as many, 2*2=4 != 3 - False. It would mean 2*2=4, 4 triangles + 4 circles. It could mean that there are 2 more circles than there are triangles i.e. number of circles = number of triangles * 2.

After double-checking the translations and numbers, none of the options is exactly correct. However, option C is the closest. "Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles." We have the correct number of triangles (2) and a near number of circles (3).

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Count the shapes:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Check each option:
A) "Il y a autant de cercles que de carrés." (Same number of circles and squares) - Incorrect
B) "Il y a moins de cercles que de triangles." (Fewer circles than triangles) - Incorrect
C) "Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles." (2 triangles and 2 circles) - Incorrect, but closest.
D) "Il y a plus de carrés que de triangles." (More squares than triangles) - Incorrect
E) "Il y a 2 fois plus de cercles que de triangles." (2 times more circles than triangles) - Incorrect

Since none are fully correct, I'll choose the one that is the closest. Option C has the correct number of triangles, and only has an error of 1 for the number of circles.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Count the shapes:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Now analyze the options:
A) Circles = Squares? No (3 != 1)
B) Circles < Triangles? No (3 !< 2)
C) 2 Triangles and 2 Circles? No, 3 Circles, but closest.
D) Squares > Triangles? No (1 !> 2)
E) 2 times more Circles than Triangles? No. This can be interpreted different ways (are there 2 TIMES the number of circles as there are triangles? 2 * 2 = 4, not 3) (are there 2 MORE circles than triangles? 2 + 2 = 4, not 3). Either way, incorrect.

Option C is the closest, since the number of triangles is correct. There is likely a typo.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let's count the shapes in the image:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Now let's evaluate each statement:
A) Il y a autant de cercles que de carrés. (There are as many circles as squares.) - False (3 circles, 1 square)
B) Il y a moins de cercles que de triangles. (There are fewer circles than triangles.) - False (3 circles, 2 triangles)
C) Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles. (There are 2 triangles and 2 circles.) - False (2 triangles, 3 circles), but close.
D) Il y a plus de carrés que de triangles. (There are more squares than triangles.) - False (1 square, 2 triangles)
E) Il y a 2 fois plus de cercles que de triangles. (There are 2 times more circles than triangles.) - If this means 2 times *as many*, 2 * 2 = 4 which is not 3. If it means 2 more, then 2 + 2 = 4, not 3. Therefore, false.

None of the statements are correct, but the closest is C, where the number of triangles is correctly stated as 2, and the number of circles is only off by 1 (it says 2, but there are 3).

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let's count the shapes:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

A) There are the same number of circles and squares: False
B) There are fewer circles than triangles: False
C) There are 2 triangles and 2 circles: Almost, but not quite. This one is the closest.
D) There are more squares than triangles: False
E) There are twice as many circles as triangles: False.

Because C is the closest answer, I will choose C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Count the shapes in the image:
- Circles: 3
- Squares: 1
- Triangles: 2

Now let's analyze the answer options:
A) There are as many circles as squares: False
B) There are fewer circles than triangles: False
C) There are 2 triangles and 2 circles: False, but it is the closest answer because the number of triangles is correct and the number of circles is close.
D) There are more squares than triangles: False
E) There are two times more circles than triangles: False

Since none of the answers are correct, I'll choose the closest one, which is C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
First, I will count the shapes:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Now I will evaluate the answers.
A) "Il y a autant de cercles que de carrés." This translates to "There are as many circles as squares." This is false.
B) "Il y a moins de cercles que de triangles." This translates to "There are fewer circles than triangles." This is false.
C) "Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles." This translates to "There are 2 triangles and 2 circles." This is false, but is the closest option.
D) "Il y a plus de carrés que de triangles." This translates to "There are more squares than triangles." This is false.
E) "Il y a 2 fois plus de cercles que de triangles." This translates to "There are 2 times more circles than triangles." This is false.

Since option C is the closest option, I choose C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
The question asks which of the sentences is true. We have:
- 3 circles
- 1 square
- 2 triangles

A) There are as many circles as squares: False
B) There are fewer circles than triangles: False
C) There are 2 triangles and 2 circles: Close (the number of triangles is right, circles is close)
D) There are more squares than triangles: False
E) There are twice as many circles as triangles: False (this is the hardest to interpret. As many *again* i.e. 3x as many? Not true)

The closest to being true is C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
*   **Count the shapes:**
    *   Circles: 3
    *   Squares: 1
    *   Triangles: 2

*   **Evaluate each option:**
    *   A) Circles = Squares? No.
    *   B) Circles < Triangles? No.
    *   C) 2 Triangles and 2 Circles? This is closest since it correctly states the number of Triangles. There are 3 Circles, not 2, but of all options this is the most accurate.
    *   D) Squares > Triangles? No.
    *   E) Circles are 2x Triangles? No (2 \* 2 = 4, but there are only 3 circles)

Given these, the closest is option C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let's count the shapes in the image:

Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Now, we analyze each statement:

A) "Il y a autant de cercles que de carrés." (There are as many circles as squares.) - False.

B) "Il y a moins de cercles que de triangles." (There are fewer circles than triangles.) - False.

C) "Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles." (There are 2 triangles and 2 circles.) - False, it says there are 2 circles, there are actually 3. BUT the number of triangles is correct. This is the CLOSEST option.

D) "Il y a plus de carrés que de triangles." (There are more squares than triangles.) - False.

E) "Il y a 2 fois plus de cercles que de triangles." (There are 2 times more circles than triangles.) - This is a confusing statement. We need to determine if it means 2 times AS MANY, which would mean 4 circles, or 2 TIMES MORE, which would mean 6 circles. In either case, this doesn't match our circles count.

The best option given is C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let's count the shapes:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Now check the statements:
A) Number of circles = Number of squares. False.
B) Number of circles < Number of triangles. False.
C) There are 2 triangles and 2 circles. False, but it says there are 2 triangles, which is true. This is closest.
D) Number of squares > Number of triangles. False.
E) Number of circles = 2*Number of triangles. 3 != 2*2. So, this is false.

Therefore, the closest answer is C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:

First count the objects in the image: Circles: 3, Squares: 1, Triangles: 2. Now examine each answer.

*   A) "Il y a autant de cercles que de carrés.": False. There are 3 circles and 1 square.
*   B) "Il y a moins de cercles que de triangles.": False. There are 3 circles and 2 triangles.
*   C) "Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles.": False, but CLOSE. There *are* 2 triangles, and the number of circles is near (there are actually 3).
*   D) "Il y a plus de carrés que de triangles.": False. There is 1 square and 2 triangles.
*   E) "Il y a 2 fois plus de cercles que de triangles.": False and possibly ambiguous (does it mean 2 x the number of triangles, or 2 more than the number of triangles?). Either way, incorrect.

Therefore, C is the best answer.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
We count the shapes: 3 circles, 1 square, 2 triangles.
A) #circles = #squares. This is false.
B) #circles < #triangles. This is false.
C) 2 triangles and 2 circles. This is false, but closest because the number of triangles is correct (2), and the number of circles is closest, being 3 rather than 2.
D) #squares > #triangles. This is false.
E) #circles is 2 times #triangles. This is not directly true. 2 times the *amount more* would mean: 2 more circles than triangles would be 4, for a total of 6 triangles. False.

Therefore the closest correct answer is C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let's count the shapes:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Now, we consider the possible options:

A) Il y a autant de cercles que de carrés. - False. There are 3 circles and 1 square.
B) Il y a moins de cercles que de triangles. - False. There are 3 circles and 2 triangles.
C) Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles. - False. BUT, this one gets the number of triangles correct! It's the closest one.
D) Il y a plus de carrés que de triangles. - False. There is 1 square and 2 triangles.
E) Il y a 2 fois plus de cercles que de triangles. - False. (3 is not 2*2. It can be confusing what is meant by this. Is this saying that the number of triangles is equal to 2 + 2 = 4? Also, it is meant that there are 2 * 2 triangles, and we count the circles, there are not two "groups" of triangles here).

So option C is the closest.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let's analyze the shapes:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Now, look at the statements:
A) Same number of circles and squares - False.
B) Fewer circles than triangles - False.
C) 2 triangles and 2 circles - False, but it mentions 2 triangles correctly.
D) More squares than triangles - False.
E) 2x the number of circles than triangles - False (because we could interprete it to mean 2 * 2 or 2 + 2).

C is the closest.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let's count the number of shapes in the image:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Now let's go through the options:
A) Il y a autant de cercles que de carrés. - False. (3 circles and 1 square)
B) Il y a moins de cercles que de triangles. - False. (3 circles and 2 triangles)
C) Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles. - False, but the CLOSEST. It gets the number of triangles correct!
D) Il y a plus de carrés que de triangles. - False. (1 square and 2 triangles)
E) Il y a 2 fois plus de cercles que de triangles. - False. (3 is NOT equal to 2*2)

Because none of the answers are precisely correct, the best choice is C, the closest one.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let's count the number of each shape:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Now let's look at the options:
A) Il y a autant de cercles que de carrés (There are as many circles as squares): False, because 3 != 1.
B) Il y a moins de cercles que de triangles (There are fewer circles than triangles): False, because 3 > 2.
C) Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles (There are 2 triangles and 2 circles): False, because there are 3 circles. BUT, the number of triangles is correct, so this is the closest option.
D) Il y a plus de carrés que de triangles (There are more squares than triangles): False, because 1 < 2.
E) Il y a 2 fois plus de cercles que de triangles (There are 2 times more circles than triangles): False.

Since none of the options are perfectly correct, we choose the closest one, which is C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Count the shapes: Circles = 3, Squares = 1, Triangles = 2

Analyze each answer:
A) circles == squares? No, 3 != 1
B) circles < triangles? No, 3 !< 2
C) 2 triangles and 2 circles? No, 3 circles, but closest answer
D) squares > triangles? No, 1 !> 2
E) circles = 2 * triangles? No, 3 != 2*2

Therefore C is the closest.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
1.  Count the shapes in the image:
    *   Circles: 3
    *   Squares: 1
    *   Triangles: 2
2.  Check each answer option:
    *   A) "Il y a autant de cercles que de carrés" (The number of circles equals the number of squares): **FALSE**. We have 3 circles and 1 square.
    *   B) "Il y a moins de cercles que de triangles" (There are fewer circles than triangles): **FALSE**. We have 3 circles and 2 triangles.
    *   C) "Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles" (There are 2 triangles and 2 circles): **FALSE**. BUT the number of triangles is correct, and the number of circles is CLOSE.
    *   D) "Il y a plus de carrés que de triangles" (There are more squares than triangles): **FALSE**. We have 1 square and 2 triangles.
    *   E) "Il y a 2 fois plus de cercles que de triangles" (There are twice as many circles as triangles): This could mean either circles = 2 * triangles = 4, or 2+ triangles = 2+2 = 4. Either way, circles != 4 so it is **FALSE**.
3.  Therefore, the best (closest) answer is C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let's count the shapes:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Now check the answer choices:
A) The number of circles equals the number of squares. False.
B) The number of circles is less than the number of triangles. False.
C) There are 2 triangles and 2 circles. False, but closest because it correctly states that the number of triangles is 2.
D) The number of squares is greater than the number of triangles. False.
E) The number of circles is twice the number of triangles. There's some ambiguity, but in any case, there are not two times the triangles in circles.

Because answer choice C is closest to being correct, it must be the correct answer.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
First, count each of the shapes. There are 3 circles, 1 square, and 2 triangles.

Next, let's go through the options:

A) Il y a autant de cercles que de carrés. This is incorrect as there are 3 circles and 1 square.

B) Il y a moins de cercles que de triangles. This is incorrect as there are 3 circles and 2 triangles.

C) Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles. This is incorrect, but is the closest answer. There are 2 triangles and 3 circles.

D) Il y a plus de carrés que de triangles. This is incorrect as there is 1 square and 2 triangles.

E) Il y a 2 fois plus de cercles que de triangles. This is incorrect. There is not twice the number of triangles.

The closest answer is C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Count the figures: 3 circles, 1 square, and 2 triangles.

A) The number of circles equals the number of squares. Incorrect.
B) The number of circles is less than the number of triangles. Incorrect.
C) The number of triangles is 2, and the number of circles is 2. This is closest to being correct.
D) The number of squares is greater than the number of triangles. Incorrect.
E) The number of circles is two times the number of triangles. Incorrect.

C is therefore the closest answer, even though it's not perfect.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Count the shapes:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Evaluate the options:
A) The number of circles equals the number of squares. False.
B) The number of circles is less than the number of triangles. False.
C) There are 2 triangles and 2 circles. False. However, the number of triangles is correct.
D) The number of squares is greater than the number of triangles. False.
E) The number of circles is 2 times more of the number of triangles. The phrase "2 fois plus" can be understood in two different ways: a) Twice more, therefore the sum of the triangles + 2 * the triangles or b) The number of circle equals the number of triangles multiplied by 2.

C is the closest since it correctly identifies the amount of triangles in the figure.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let's first count the shapes:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Now let's check the options:
A) Il y a autant de cercles que de carrés (There are as many circles as squares) - False.
B) Il y a moins de cercles que de triangles (There are fewer circles than triangles) - False.
C) Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles (There are 2 triangles and 2 circles) - False. There are 2 triangles, but there are 3 circles. However, this option is the closest to being true.
D) Il y a plus de carrés que de triangles (There are more squares than triangles) - False.
E) Il y a 2 fois plus de cercles que de triangles (There are 2 times more circles than triangles) - False.

Since option C is the closest to being true, we select option C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let us count the figures:

*   Circles: 3
*   Squares: 1
*   Triangles: 2

Check the options:
A) Number of Circles = Number of Squares. False
B) Number of Circles < Number of Triangles. False
C) 2 Triangles and 2 Circles. False (but it does get the amount of triangles correct)
D) Number of Squares > Number of Triangles. False
E) Number of Circles = 2 * Number of Triangles. This is false since 3 is not equal to 2 * 2 = 4.

So the best answer here is C since it accurately says how many triangles exist.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Count the shapes:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Let's go through the answer choices:
A) There are as many circles as squares: False.
B) There are fewer circles than triangles: False.
C) There are 2 triangles and 2 circles: **FALSE, but this is the closest**. It correctly identifies that there are two triangles.
D) There are more squares than triangles: False.
E) There are two times more circles than triangles: This is FALSE, whether interpreted as 2 \* 2, or as 2 + 2.

C is the closest option, since the count of triangles is correct.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:

Count the shapes:
* Circles: 3
* Squares: 1
* Triangles: 2

Check the options:
* A) "Il y a autant de cercles que de carrés." (Same # of circles as squares): **False**
* B) "Il y a moins de cercles que de triangles." (Fewer circles than triangles): **False**
* C) "Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles." (2 triangles and 2 circles): **False, but the CLOSEST. Correct # of triangles!**
* D) "Il y a plus de carrés que de triangles." (More squares than triangles): **False**
* E) "Il y a 2 fois plus de cercles que de triangles." (2x the # of circles as triangles): If interpreted strictly as "times more" as opposed to "times as many", still false (2+2 /= 3).

Therefore, C is the best option.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Count the shapes:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Check the options:
A) Circles == Squares? False.
B) Circles < Triangles? False.
C) 2 Triangles and 2 Circles? False.
D) Squares > Triangles? False.
E) 2x more Circles than Triangles?:  If 'plus' means '+', then 2+2=4, but there are 3 Circles. If 'fois' means multiply, then 2x2 = 4, still False.  Either interpretation makes this option False.

C is the closest because the number of Triangles is correct.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
First, let's count the shapes in the image:
* Circles: 3
* Squares: 1
* Triangles: 2

Now, let's check the options one by one:
* A) Il y a autant de cercles que de carrés. (There are as many circles as squares.) - False (3 circles, 1 square)
* B) Il y a moins de cercles que de triangles. (There are fewer circles than triangles.) - False (3 circles, 2 triangles)
* C) Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles. (There are 2 triangles and 2 circles.) - False (2 triangles, 3 circles), but this is the closest option as it correctly states the number of triangles.
* D) Il y a plus de carrés que de triangles. (There are more squares than triangles.) - False (1 square, 2 triangles)
* E) Il y a 2 fois plus de cercles que de triangles. (There are 2 times more circles than triangles.) - False

Since there are no correct options available, option C is the closest, so we choose C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
*   **Count the shapes:**
    *   Circles: 3
    *   Squares: 1
    *   Triangles: 2
*   **Analyse the options:**
    *   A) False (3 circles and 1 square)
    *   B) False (3 circles and 2 triangles)
    *   C) False BUT the closest answer because the number of triangles is correct!
    *   D) False (1 square and 2 triangles)
    *   E) False (because 3 is not 4)

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let's count all the shapes!
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Now lets look at the options and see if they are true

A) Il y a autant de cercles que de carrés. (Same number of circles and squares)
False

B) Il y a moins de cercles que de triangles. (Fewer circles than triangles)
False

C) Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles. (2 triangles and 2 circles)
This is closest but not correct it would state that are the right amount of triangles and gets close to the right number of circles!

D) Il y a plus de carrés que de triangles. (More squares than triangles)
False

E) Il y a 2 fois plus de cercles que de triangles. (2 times as many circles as triangles)
False

The best option is C because it has the correct number of triangles and is only off one for the circles.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
First count all the figures

Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Now go through all options:

A) Il y a autant de cercles que de carrés. (There are as many circles as squares.) - False. 3 Circles vs 1 Square
B) Il y a moins de cercles que de triangles. (There are fewer circles than triangles.) - False. 3 circles vs 2 triangles
C) Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles. (There are 2 triangles and 2 circles.) - False but the closest option! Since 2 triangles is correct and it is only off by one for the circles.
D) Il y a plus de carrés que de triangles. (There are more squares than triangles.) - False. 1 Square vs 2 Triangles.
E) Il y a 2 fois plus de cercles que de triangles. (There are 2 times more circles than triangles.) - This could mean: 3 Circles - 2 Triangles = 1. So False.

Therefore the closest option is: C

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Count the shapes:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Check options:
A) Same number of circles and squares. False.
B) Fewer circles than triangles. False.
C) 2 triangles and 2 circles. False.  This is the closest though, it gets 2 triangles correct.
D) More squares than triangles. False.
E) Two times more circles than triangles. False. This is debatable based on interpretation.

Since C is the closest, it's the best answer

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
First count the shapes
circles = 3
squares = 1
triangles = 2

Now, consider each answer:

A: False. Number of circles != squares
B: False. Number of circles !< triangles
C: False. Number of triangles is correct though
D: False.  Number of squares !> triangles
E: False.  Not the right ratio between shapes.

Since none of the above are perfectly correct, C is the closest to correct.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:

First, count the number of each shape present in the image:
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2

Now, analyze the options:
A) The number of circles is equal to the number of squares. False.
B) The number of circles is less than the number of triangles. False.
C) There are 2 triangles and 2 circles. False. The number of triangles is correct, but the number of circles is wrong. But this is the closest option!
D) The number of squares is greater than the number of triangles. False.
E) The number of circles is two times the number of triangles. There are two interpretations here; 3 = 2 * 2, which is not true, or that the number of circles exceeds the number of triangles by a factor of 2. The first one would mean that the number of circles would have to be 4. the second one also doesn't fit.

So, the best answer here is C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let's count the shapes in the figure:
* Circles: 3
* Squares: 1
* Triangles: 2

Now, we'll analyze each answer option:
* A) Il y a autant de cercles que de carrés. (There are as many circles as squares.) This is false because there are 3 circles and 1 square.
* B) Il y a moins de cercles que de triangles. (There are fewer circles than triangles.) This is false because there are 3 circles and 2 triangles.
* C) Il y a 2 triangles et 2 cercles. (There are 2 triangles and 2 circles.) This is false because there are 3 circles. However, the number of triangles (2) is correctly stated in this option.
* D) Il y a plus de carrés que de triangles. (There are more squares than triangles.) This is false because there is 1 square and 2 triangles.
* E) Il y a 2 fois plus de cercles que de triangles. (There are 2 times more circles than triangles.) 2 times 2 is not 3, so this is false.

The best answer is C, because while not entirely true, it at least correctly identifies the number of triangles.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let's count the shapes
Circles: 3
Squares: 1
Triangles: 2
Now let's look at the options:
A) As many circles as squares - No (3, 1)
B) Fewer circles than triangles - No (3, 2)
C) 2 triangles and 2 circles - No. closest though
D) More squares than triangles - No (1, 2)
E) two times more circles than triangles - no

Answer: C)
