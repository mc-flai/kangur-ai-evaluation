Reasoning:
The problem states that a notebook costs 4.20 euros. If we buy ten notebooks, we get a 10% discount. We need to find the price of each notebook when buying ten.
First, we calculate the discount amount: 10% of 4.20 euros is 0.10 * 4.20 = 0.42 euros.
Next, we subtract the discount from the original price: 4.20 - 0.42 = 3.78 euros.
Therefore, when buying ten notebooks, each notebook costs 3.78 euros.
