Reasoning:
The problem states that four squirrels ate a total of 11 nuts. Each squirrel ate at least one nut, and no two squirrels ate the same number of nuts. Three squirrels ate 9 nuts in total. One squirrel ate exactly 3 nuts. We need to find out how many nuts the squirrel that ate the most nuts ate.

Let the number of nuts eaten by the four squirrels be $n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4$, where $n_1 < n_2 < n_3 < n_4$.
We know that $n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 = 11$ and that one of the squirrels ate 3 nuts.
Since each squirrel ate a different number of nuts, we can set $n_1=1$, $n_2=2$, $n_3=3$, then $n_4=11-1-2-3 = 5$, which satisfies the conditions.
However, the condition that three squirrels ate a total of 9 nuts is yet to be satisfied.
Let's assume that $n_1=3$. Since each squirrel ate at least 1 nut, let $n_1 = 1, n_2 = 2, n_3 = 3$. In this case, $1+2+3 = 6 \ne 9$, so let's look for other combinations.

Since one squirrel ate 3 nuts, let's assume the squirrel that ate 3 nuts is not among the three squirrels that ate a total of 9 nuts. Then $n_1+n_2+n_3 = 9$. Also $n_1 < n_2 < n_3$. Then $n_4=3$.
We need $n_1+n_2+n_3 + n_4 = 11$, so $n_1+n_2+n_3 = 11 - n_4 = 11 - 3 = 8$. This is in contradiction with $n_1+n_2+n_3 = 9$. Therefore, the squirrel that ate 3 nuts is part of the three squirrels that ate a total of 9 nuts.
So let's consider that $n_1, n_2, n_3$ are the squirrels that ate 9 nuts, one of them ate 3 nuts. Let $n_1=3$, so $n_2+n_3=6$. Since $n_1 < n_2 < n_3$, $3 < n_2 < n_3$. Possible values for $n_2$ and $n_3$ are $n_2=2$ which is not possible because $3 < n_2$. However, $n_2 = 1, n_3 = 5$. This means we have $1, 3, 5$ or $1, 2, 6$.
Since $n_1 < n_2 < n_3$ we can have $n_1 = 1, n_2=2, n_3=6$, $n_4$ where $n_1+n_2+n_3+n_4=11 \implies 1+2+6+n_4 = 11 \implies n_4=2$. But two squirrels cannot have eaten same number of nuts.
Let $n_1=1, n_2=3, n_3=5$, then $1+3+5=9$. Then $n_4$ would equal $11-9=2$, which is less than 3, so this doesn't work.
If the three squirrels that ate 9 are such that $n_1=1, n_2=2, n_3=6$, then $n_1+n_2+n_3 = 9$. Then $n_4 = 11 - 9 = 2$. That means $1 < 2 < 6,3$. But each ate a different number of nuts, so one of $1,2,6$ must equal $3$ or $n_4 = 3$, but the 2 isn't possible.
Try 1, 3, 5 is 9 so it is either those. 1 + 3 +5+2. No they're unique. $3$ nuts + x+ y +z = 9 and 1 +2 +6.

If $n_4=6$. $11-6 = 5$.
Let $n_1=1, n_2=2, n_3=5$
If n4= 7, $n_1 +n_2+n_3 = 4$. If n1= 1, 2, 3 is not satisfied. Not different. So 1,1 + 2+3. $1+ 1$. So we need three nuts. If 3.
$2 x+y+1 x+2 $. And four +6 n47 $1 $ .n.

$11-3 = 8
Three squirrel = $12 $.. The possibilities could be

Reasoning:
We are given that four squirrels ate 11 nuts in total. Each squirrel ate at least one nut, and no two squirrels ate the same number of nuts. Three squirrels ate 9 nuts in total, and one squirrel ate exactly 3 nuts. We need to find the maximum number of nuts eaten by any squirrel.

Let the number of nuts eaten by the four squirrels be $a, b, c, d$, where $a < b < c < d$.
Since the total number of nuts is 11, we have $a + b + c + d = 11$.
We also know that one squirrel ate 3 nuts. Let's assume $b = 3$.
The sum of nuts eaten by three squirrels is 9. This means the squirrel that ate 3 nuts is part of the three squirrels that ate a total of 9 nuts.
Let the three squirrels that ate 9 nuts be $a, b, c$. Thus, $a + b + c = 9$, where $b = 3$. So, $a + 3 + c = 9$, which means $a + c = 6$.
Since $a < b = 3 < c$, we have the following possibilities for $a$ and $c$: $a=1, c=5$ or $a=2, c=4$.
Then $d = 11 - 9 = 2$. But we are given that all the squirrels ate a different number of nuts, so 2 is not possible, as we already have $a=1,3,5$ or a=2,3,4 as squirrel number.

However if $ a, b =4 is not possible a=2=1$
If squirrels are= 23 and $4.23$. Since each squirrels a different numbers $a=1
1 + n$.

Reasoning:
The translation of the problem is as follows:
Four squirrels ate 11 nuts in total. Each squirrel ate at least one nut. No two squirrels ate the same number of nuts. Three squirrels ate 9 nuts in total. One of them ate exactly 3 nuts. How many nuts did the squirrel that ate the most nuts eat?

Let's denote the number of nuts eaten by the squirrels as $n_1 < n_2 < n_3 < n_4$.
We know that $n_1+n_2+n_3+n_4 = 11$ and that $n_i \ge 1$ for all i. Also, we know that one of them ate 3 nuts. Let $n_2=3$.

We know that 3 of them sum to 9. Since $n_2=3$, we have $n_1+n_2+n_3 = 9$ which implies $n_1+3+n_3=9$ or $n_1+n_3 = 6$. Since $n_1<n_2=3$, $n_1$ can be 1 or 2. If $n_1=1$, $n_3=5$. If $n_1=2$, $n_3=4$.
Now we need to find $n_4$.

Case 1: $n_1=1, n_2=3, n_3=5$. Then $1+3+5+n_4=11$, so $n_4=11-9=2$. But this is impossible since $n_1=1 < n_4=2 < n_2=3 < n_3=5$ is not in increasing order and n4 needs to be greater than n3, or n4 must != to what and more than n4 should equal:
