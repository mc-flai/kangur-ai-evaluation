Reasoning:
Let's denote the distances as follows:
- D to F = 18 km
- P to D = 2 * (D to F) = 2 * 18 km = 36 km
- F to V = 2 * (D to F) = 2 * 18 km = 36 km
The total distance is 100 km. So, P to D + D to F + F to V + V to P = 100 km
Substituting the known values: 36 km + 18 km + 36 km + V to P = 100 km
90 km + V to P = 100 km
V to P = 100 km - 90 km = 10 km
However, this doesn't match any of the options. Let's reread the problem.
The total distance is 100 km.
D to F = 18 km
P to D = 2 * (D to F) = 36 km
F to V = (1/2) * (D to F) = 18 km / 2 = 9 km
So, P to D + D to F + F to V + V to P = 100 km
36 km + 18 km + 9 km + V to P = 100 km
63 km + V to P = 100 km
V to P = 100 km - 63 km = 37 km
So the distance from Volcanique to PÃ¢ques is 37 km.
