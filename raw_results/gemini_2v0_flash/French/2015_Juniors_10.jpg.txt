Reasoning:
We have four different non-zero digits, W, X, Y, Z, such that W < X < Y < Z.
We want to maximize the difference between the number XZ and the number WY.
To maximize the difference, we need to maximize XZ and minimize WY.
The largest possible value for XZ occurs when X and Z are large. Since Z is the largest digit, let Z = 9. Then X must be as large as possible, but smaller than Z. So, let X = 8. Then XZ = 89.
To minimize WY, we need W and Y to be as small as possible. Since W < X < Y < Z, and X=8, we have W < 8 and Y < 9. Since W and Y must be distinct, we choose the two smallest digits from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. Then let W = 1 and Y = 2. So WY = 12.
The difference is XZ - WY = 89 - 12 = 77.
We need to check if there are other better choices. We want to maximize XZ-WY. Let W=1, Y=2, so X and Z can be anything as long as X > W and Z > Y. So let X=3, and Z=4. So, we are not forced to pick X=8, and Z=9.
To maximize the difference XZ - WY, we must maximize XZ, and minimize WY. To maximize XZ, we need X to be large, and Z to be the largest. The biggest possible value for Z is 9.
Let Z = 9, then Y < 9, X < Y, W < X.
Maximize X: X must be smaller than Z, so let X = 8.
So we now need to minimize WY. Let W=1, then X < Y < Z. We already picked X = 8. So we want to minimize Y > X=8, but Y < Z = 9, so no number in between. No this approach won't work, as all the digits are different!
Take Z=9 and Y=8, now X < Y, so try to make X as big as possible. So let X=7. Take W=1, then 79 - 18 = 61
Consider X=2, Y=3, Z=4, W=1. Numbers formed are 24 and 13. 24-13=11. This difference is low!
To maximize the difference, we need to set up XZ as large as possible, then WY as small as possible. So, let X, Y, Z be big, and let W, X, Y, be small.
We know W < X < Y < Z, and X,Y are between W and Z.
Maximize XZ - Minimize WY. So let Z=9. Maximize X. Then the options for X are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. Set X=8.
Then minimize W, Y. Let W = 1. Then Y needs to be between X=8 and Z=9. But Y< Z=9. So, there is no Y to fit between!
If X=2, Y=3, and Z=4, and W=1. Then WY = 13, and XZ=24. Difference 24 - 13=11
If Z=9, and W=1. Then X=8, and Y=2 does not work. This means we need to minimize WY and maximize XZ at same time. This is the trick of the qn!
Try again:
Maximize XZ: so let Z=9, then X < 9. X=8.
Minimize WY: Then W=1. We need to choose some Y such that X < Y < Z where W,X,Y,Z are unique.
Then let W=1, X =2, Y=3, Z=4. The numbers are 24 - 13 = 11
Choose Z=9, W=1. Max X, min Y.
Set Z = 9. Y < 9. Try Y=2. X=1? Not allowed
Set Y =3. X must < 3. Then X=2.
Z = 9, X=8. 24-13 = 11. W<X<Y<Z implies, then
W=1, X=2, Y=8, Z=9 doesn't fit.
Choose to min WY, Let W=56.
W=10
1<2<3<4. Min WY means Y<3.
Max XZ, min WY

Take values near to each other.

Take W=1, X=2, Y=3, Z=4, we get 24 - 13 = 11
Take W=5, X=6, Y=7, Z=8, we get 68 - 57 = 11

86
Choose non consecutive:
Consider extreme numbers, then
XZ and WY
If choose W = 1, Z = 9, then X and Y need to be selected. So try to have W = 1 and X =2. Y<9

12?9.
If W =1 and Z =9, X = 7 and Y =8
Set XZ high,
If large, pick W=1
XZ 9

We require larger values near start!

Largest possible difference would be

Largest difference 1 x96 W =3 x= =7=
Consider =

Reasoning:
Let $W = 1$, $X = 2$, $Y = 3$, $Z = 9$. Numbers are $29$ and $13$. $29 - 13 = 16$.
Let $W = 1$, $X = 8$, $Y = 2$.
If $XZ$ is made maximum by setting large value for X, Z as $XZ = 89$. To get diff maximal we want to minimize $WY = 1,2,...$.

If largest val is required pick the number nearest.

Reasoning: To maximize the difference XZ - WY, we want XZ to be as large as possible and WY to be as small as possible. Thus we want to maximize X and Z while minimizing W and Y, but adhering to the constraint W < X < Y < Z.  To this end, let Z = 9.  Now we want to choose the largest possible X less than Z, so let X = 8. Now we want W and Y to be as small as possible, so let W = 1. Then we need X < Y < Z. Since X = 8 and Z = 9, this is impossible.

Instead let Z=9, choose X = max allowed 1. Then the maximum difference is when XY = 18 or x1 = xy or xx...
Try something better.

To get largest difference is if digits near large value. Then we should
Z and X must
921365.
Since x large and W. Xz=8,Y4 x y z is a big is to make them 10.

Reasoning:
Let $W < X < Y < Z$. We want to maximize $XZ - WY$.
Write as $(10X + Z) - (10W + Y)$.
$10X + Z - (10W + Y) = 10(X - W) + (Z - Y)$.

To make $10(X - W)$ large, we want a large $X$ and small $W$. So let $W = 1$. We want $X$ to be as close to $9$ as possible, then $Y < Z \le 9$.
Since we must be different, consider $Z = 9$. Since $W<X<Y<Z$. $10(X-1) + (9-Y)$ largest?

Answer: D)
Reasoning: We want XZ - WY to be as large as possible. To achieve this, we need to make XZ as large as possible and WY as small as possible, while respecting the condition W < X < Y < Z. Start by maximizing Z, so let Z = 9.
Let X=7 then, it would also be better.
To minimize WY let W=1, if possible, W=1, so we have two free numbers.
Pick y=8: X = 27 or .

Answer: D)
Let W = 3 X = X=7 and Z = 978-

If We let as 9

Reasoning:
We are given that W < X < Y < Z, where W, X, Y, and Z are distinct non-zero digits.
We want to maximize the difference between XZ (10X + Z) and WY (10W + Y). So we want to maximize (10X + Z) - (10W + Y).
Let W=1; So we want maximum value, that means

Answer D)

Final Answer: D)
Reasoning: To maximize the difference XZ - WY, we want to maximize the value of XZ and minimize the value of WY, whilst respecting the restriction W < X < Y < Z. We can start with testing values near to a few different values on Z.
If we have Z=9, then X needs to be the value below it.
Take that X is 8, we need Y under, but Y < Z. Which Y < 9, and since X need to be bigger than W.
Lets' W = 27/ x = a

Final Answer: D)
Reasoning: The problem states that W, X, Y, Z are distinct non-zero digits in increasing order. We want to maximize XZ - WY.
To maximize XZ, we want X and Z to be large. To minimize WY, we want W and Y to be small.
Let's take W = 1.
To make X as large as possible, let's try setting Z = 9.
If Z = 9, Y < 9. We want to maximize X given that X < Y.
Let X be 6.
Let x;7 then take a set around that

So if choose these values
I tried to consider each to select better range
Final Answer: D)
Reasoning: Let the digits W, X, Y, Z be in increasing order.
W < X < Y < Z. We want to find the largest value of XZ - WY.

To make this large, the difference needs largest Z -

Final Answer: D)
Reasoning:
We need to maximize $XZ - WY = (10X + Z) - (10W + Y)$.
This implies we need $X, Z$ large and $W, Y$ small. $Z$ has to be $9$ to maximize $XZ$.
Therefore try

Reasoning: To maximise XZ - WY we choose 127-9
Final Answer: D)

Final Answer: D)
Reasoning: The largest possible difference occurs when XZ is maximized and WY is minimized. Since the digits are different and in increasing order, a good strategy is to make Z close to 9 and W close to 1. Start with assigning Z = 9. The numbers x,y must each need to be under

Final Answer: D)
Reasoning: Maximize XZ - WY subject to W < X < Y < Z
Final Answer: D)
Reasoning:
Final Answer: D)
Reasoning: Maximize XZ, minimize WY so we have largest minus. The best number to work with is Z = 8 but still it is more likely to produce smaller result .
Final Answer: D)
Reasoning:
The two numbers can each be written as 10X + Z and 10W + Y, so the difference is 10X + Z - 10W - Y = 10(X - W) + (Z - Y). We need to make X much larger than W, while attempting to make Z - Y big.
If W,X,Y and Z values between 40 -678)1,75 , and then there is a great change , and X=2 ,and it reduces
If X ->Z89-> + ->60
We also need some numbers from 0- 2 ,. to assign W
