Reasoning:
The question asks which series of 5 cards cannot be arranged such that all fruits of the same kind are next to each other by swapping only two cards.

A) Grape, Apple, Apple, Grape, Cherry. We can swap the last grape and the cherry to get Grape, Apple, Apple, Cherry, Grape. Swapping Cherry and Grape again makes it work: Grape, Apple, Apple, Grape, Cherry. By swapping the last grape and the cherry, we get: Grape, Apple, Apple, Cherry, Grape -> then we swap the apple and the grape: Grape, Grape, Apple, Cherry, Apple. Then swap the apple and the cherry.
B) Apple, Cherry, Apple, Grape, Cherry. We can swap the first cherry and the grape to get: Apple, Grape, Apple, Cherry, Cherry. then we can swap grape and apple: Apple, Apple, Grape, Cherry, Cherry.
C) Apple, Grape, Cherry, Grape, Apple. We can swap the first grape and the first apple to get: Grape, Apple, Cherry, Grape, Apple. It cannot be done with only 2 swaps.
D) Cherry, Cherry, Apple, Grape, Cherry. We can swap grape and cherry. Cherry, Cherry, Apple, Cherry, Grape. With only one swap, we cannot achieve the intended arrangement.
E) Apple, Cherry, Grape, Apple, Cherry. Swap the two apples to get: Apple, Cherry, Apple, Grape, Cherry. That doesn't help. Swap cherry and grape. Apple, Grape, Cherry, Apple, Cherry

Consider option C: Apple, Grape, Cherry, Grape, Apple.
If we swap apple and grape. Grape Apple Cherry Grape Apple.
If we swap Apple and Cherry: Apple Cherry Grape Grape Apple. Can't put the same fruits together with two swaps.

Reasoning:
After checking each one, I realized option C won't allow the rearrangement to put same fruit next to each other with only two swaps.

Answer: C)
