Reasoning:
Simone has 20 euros, and each of her 4 sisters has 10 euros. The total amount of money is 20 + 4 * 10 = 20 + 40 = 60 euros.  There are 5 people in total (Simone and her 4 sisters).  If they all have the same amount, they each have 60 / 5 = 12 euros.  Each sister needs 12 - 10 = 2 euros more.  Simone needs to give each of her sisters 2 euros.

Answer: A)
