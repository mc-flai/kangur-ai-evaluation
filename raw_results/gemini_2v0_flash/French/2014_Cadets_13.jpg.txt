Reasoning:
Let PQRS be a rectangle with PQ = 11 cm and QR = 6 cm. Since PQRS is a rectangle, PS = QR = 6 cm and SR = PQ = 11 cm.
The angle bisector of angle SPQ intersects RS at T. Since angle SPQ = 90 degrees, angle SPT = angle TPQ = 45 degrees. Also, angle PST = 90 degrees. Thus triangle PTS is a right-angled triangle. Let ST = x. Then tan(45) = ST/PS, so 1 = x/6, thus x = 6. So ST = 6 cm.
The angle bisector of angle PQR intersects RS at U. Since angle PQR = 90 degrees, angle PQU = angle UQR = 45 degrees. Also, angle QRU = 90 degrees. Thus triangle QRU is a right-angled triangle. Let RU = y. Then tan(45) = RU/QR, so 1 = y/6, thus y = 6. So RU = 6 cm.
Since SR = ST + TU + UR, we have 11 = 6 + TU + 6, so TU = 11 - 6 - 6 = 11 - 12 = -1. However, this is impossible since length cannot be negative.
Let's revise the given information. We are given that T and U are on the side [RS]. Then the distance SR = ST + TU + UR.
ST = x and RU = y.
Tan(angle SPT) = ST/PS = ST/6, ST = PS*Tan(angle SPT) = 6 * tan(45) = 6.
Tan(angle RQU) = RU/QR = RU/6, RU = QR*Tan(angle RQU) = 6 * tan(45) = 6.
SR = 11 = ST + TU + UR = 6 + TU + 6.
TU = 11 - 12 = -1. The information that the angle bisectors intersect RS is inconsistent with given information.
Perhaps the intersection is not on RS, but RS is on the line containing the points. Then the coordinates of the vertices are: P(0, 6), Q(11, 6), R(11, 0), and S(0, 0).
Equation of line SP: y = 0
Equation of line RS: x = 11
Equation of line QR: y = 6
Equation of line PQ: x = 0
Equation of bisector of angle SPQ is y = x. Since T lies on this line and on x = 11, T(t, 0). SPQ= 90 degree. T is intersection of RS and the angle bisector of SPQ, y=x. So this line should have slope 1, but slope of ST has to be positive. The equation must be y = x. Line RS is actually on top here.
Coordinates are: P(0, 6), Q(11, 6), R(11, 0), and S(0, 0).
Bisector of angle SPQ: y = x. Intersects SR at T.
Equation of SR: y = 0. So T=(x,0) where y =x means x =0.
Line bisecting PQR: y = -x + 17. Line RS is actually on top. Intersects SR at U.
Bisector of angle PQR which is PQR = x = y-6, then x+ y -6
The solution requires some understanding of geometry involving rectangles and angle bisectors and the points where they intersect the sides. Also, SR is equal to 11. And PQ=11, QR=6.
ST=6 then TU needs to be negative. There is a potential error.
In general TU should measure 1cm if the bisectors are not on the RS, but some other side, but because SR is the side this should happen inside RS.

Reasoning:
Let PQRS be a rectangle with PQ = 11 and QR = 6. Therefore PS = 6 and RS = 11. Let T be a point on RS such that ST = x. Since the angle bisector of SPQ intersects RS at T, triangle PST has angles 45, 90, 45. Therefore ST = PS = 6. Similarly let U be a point on RS such that RU = y. Since the angle bisector of PQR intersects RS at U, triangle QRU has angles 45, 90, 45. Therefore RU = QR = 6.
Now RS = ST + TU + UR = 11.
Substituting, 11 = 6 + TU + 6.
TU = 11 - 12 = -1. Since distance cannot be negative there must be a mistake in the diagram. Also, we may assume T and U lie *on the line through* RS, but are not necessarily *between* R and S. Assuming they lie on the line, we have three cases:
1. T is between R and U. Then TU = |ST-SU|. We know ST = 6 and SU = SR+RU = 11+6 = 17. Thus TU = |6-17| = 11.
2. U is between S and T. Then TU = |SU-ST|. SU = SR+RU = 17. ST=6. TU = |17-6| = 11.
3. R is between T and S. Then TU=|TR-UR|, SU=17, ST=6. UR=6, ST=6. 11=TR+RS, TR = ST-RS = |-11|. This doesn't really make sense.

Since the error comes from the TU = -1 being a contradiction, it may be that TU =1. This would make the length measure as 1 cm.
