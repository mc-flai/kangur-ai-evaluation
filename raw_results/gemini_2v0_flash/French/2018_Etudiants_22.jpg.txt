Reasoning: Let's analyze the statements of each kangaroo.
*   If A is lying, then either A is the biggest or A is the smallest. If A is the biggest, then C is also telling the truth, which is a contradiction because only one kangaroo lies. Therefore if A is lying, A is the smallest.
*   If B is lying, then B is the smallest.
*   If C is lying, then C is not the biggest.
*   If D is lying, then D is not the smallest.

If C is telling the truth, then C is the largest. If D is also telling the truth, then D is the smallest. Then A is telling the truth, so A is neither the smallest nor the largest. But then B must be lying, because B is not the smallest. Since only one lies, C can't be telling the truth.

If D is telling the truth, then D is the smallest. Also, B is telling the truth as B is not the smallest. If A is telling the truth as well, then C must be lying, and the largest must be A. This is consistent with the information.

Therefore, C is lying.
If C is lying and D is telling the truth, then D is the smallest. B is also telling the truth (not the smallest). A is also telling the truth (not the smallest, not the largest). Thus A is neither the smallest nor the largest. Therefore, A is the largest.
