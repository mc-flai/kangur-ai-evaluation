Reasoning:
Let the two rectangles be R1 and R2. Both have sides 3 cm and 9 cm.
The area of each rectangle is 3 * 9 = 27 cm².
The overlapping area is a parallelogram.
If we consider the overlapping region as a parallelogram, its base lies on the side of length 9 cm, and its height is half of the other side, which is 3/2 = 1.5 cm. The area of the parallelogram is therefore 9 * 1.5 = 13.5 cm².

Answer: B)
