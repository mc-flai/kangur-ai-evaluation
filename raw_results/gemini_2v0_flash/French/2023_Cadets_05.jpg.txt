Reasoning:
The problem states that the figure shows the starting point, direction, and path traveled in 5 seconds for four bumper cars. Assuming they continue at the same speed and direction, we must determine which two cars will collide first.
- Car 1 moves diagonally to the right and upwards.
- Car 2 moves diagonally to the right and downwards.
- Car 3 moves directly downwards.
- Car 4 moves directly to the left.

From the diagram, it appears that car 2 and car 3 are moving towards each other. Therefore, they are likely to collide first.
Car 1 and Car 4 are moving in relatively opposite directions and are unlikely to collide any time soon if at all.

Reasoning:
Answer: D)
