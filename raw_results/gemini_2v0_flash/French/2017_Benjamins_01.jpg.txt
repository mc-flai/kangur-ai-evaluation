Reasoning: The initial order is 2017. We need to find which of the options can be obtained by swapping only two cards.
A) 2170: Swapping 0 and 1.
B) 0127: Swapping 2 and 0.
C) 7021: Swapping 7 and 2, then swapping 1 and 7 is two swaps but we can only do one swap.
D) 1027: Swapping 2 and 1.
E) 7210: Swapping 7 and 2, then swapping 0 and 1.

Options A, B, and D can be obtained by swapping only two cards. Among the given options, only option A, option B and option D can be obtained through swapping 2 cards in "2017".

Checking:

A) 2170 - swap 0 and 1. This works.
B) 0127 - swap 0 and 2. This works.
C) 7021 - needs multiple swaps - 7 with 2, then 1 with 7.
D) 1027 - swap 1 and 2. This works.
E) 7210 - needs multiple swaps. 7 with 2, and 0 with 1.

Of A, B and D, A is the only one in the list of answers.
Reasoning:
The only option that results from swapping only two of the original cards (2017) is 2170, obtained by swapping 0 and 1.

Answer: A)
