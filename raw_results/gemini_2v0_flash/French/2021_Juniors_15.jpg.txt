Reasoning:
The starting order is I, II, III, IV, V.
The finishing order is III, V, I, IV, II.
To find the minimum number of points, we count the minimum number of passes.
- III passed I and II (2 points).
- V passed I, II and IV (3 points).
- I passed IV and II (2 points).
- IV passed II (1 point).
Total points = 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 8.
