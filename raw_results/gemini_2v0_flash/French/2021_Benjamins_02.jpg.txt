Reasoning: Ã‰ric has 6 bricks: 3 white and 3 grey. We need to determine which construction can be made with these 6 bricks.
A) has 3 grey and 3 white bricks.
B) has 3 grey and 3 white bricks.
C) has 3 grey and 3 white bricks.
D) has 3 grey and 3 white bricks.
E) has 3 grey and 3 white bricks.
All the options appear to have 3 grey and 3 white bricks. The question asks what construction he can make with his 6 bricks, all constructions have 6 bricks with the right colors, so all of them seem possible constructions. I will choose A) because it has the most balanced color pattern, but actually any of A, B, C, D, E seems to be correct.

Answer: A)
