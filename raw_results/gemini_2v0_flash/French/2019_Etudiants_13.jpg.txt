Reasoning:
The question asks for the number of positive integers $n$ such that the largest divisor of $n$ (excluding $n$ itself) is $n-6$.
This means $n-6$ is a divisor of $n$. Since $n=(n-6)+6$, we must have that $n-6$ divides 6.
The positive divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.
So $n-6$ can be 1, 2, 3, or 6.
If $n-6 = 1$, then $n=7$. The divisors of 7 are 1 and 7. The largest divisor (excluding 7) is 1. But $n-6=7-6=1$. So $n=7$ is a solution.
If $n-6 = 2$, then $n=8$. The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. The largest divisor (excluding 8) is 4. But $n-6=8-6=2$. So $n=8$ is not a solution.
If $n-6 = 3$, then $n=9$. The divisors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9. The largest divisor (excluding 9) is 3. But $n-6=9-6=3$. So $n=9$ is a solution.
If $n-6 = 6$, then $n=12$. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The largest divisor (excluding 12) is 6. But $n-6=12-6=6$. So $n=12$ is a solution.
Therefore, the possible values of $n$ are 7, 9, and 12.
There are 3 such integers.
