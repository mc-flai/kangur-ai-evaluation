Reasoning:
Let the missing number between the houses be $x$. For the left house, the sum of the numbers is $6 + 2 + 5 + x + y = 20$, where $y$ is the missing number at the bottom of the left house. For the right house, the sum is $3 + x + 1 + y + ? = 20$.
So, $13 + x + y = 20$ and $4 + x + y + ? = 20$.
From the first equation, $x + y = 20 - 13 = 7$.
Substituting $x + y = 7$ in the second equation, we get $4 + 7 + ? = 20$, so $11 + ? = 20$, which means $? = 20 - 11 = 9$.
