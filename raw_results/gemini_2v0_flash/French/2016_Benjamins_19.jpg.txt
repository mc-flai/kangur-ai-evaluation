Reasoning:
The paper is folded in half three times. When a piece is cut out of the folded paper, it will appear multiple times when unfolded, determined by the number of folds. Here, there are three folds. When the paper is unfolded to the initial circular shape, each cut will appear 2^3 = 8 times. Also, the cut is parallel to one of the folds. So the resulting shape in the middle will have 8 symmetrical cuts. Option A has 8 symmetrical cuts and is the only option that follows this requirement. Options B and E have 8 symmetrical cuts that are not of the same shape as those formed in the image. Options C and D have 4 symmetrical cuts instead of 8.

Answer: A)
