Reasoning: Let the numbers in the boxes be $x_1, x_2, ..., x_9$. The sums of consecutive boxes are given as $x_1+x_2 = 7$, $x_2+x_3 = 9$, $x_3+x_4 = 11$, $x_4+x_5=9$. Also, $x_1+x_2=7$, $x_2+x_3=9$, $x_3+x_4=11$, $x_4+x_5=9$. Additionally, $x_1+x_2=15$, $x_3=3$, $x_4+x_5=15$, $x_5+x_6=8$. The gray box is $x_3$.
We are given that $x_3=3$. Thus, the number in the gray box is 3. However, 3 is not an option.

We have the following equations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $x_1+x_2 = 7$
    \item $x_2+x_3 = 9$
    \item $x_3+x_4 = 11$
    \item $x_4+x_5 = 9$
    \item $x_5+x_6 = 8$
\end{enumerate}
We are given $x_2+x_3 = 3$. This is a contradiction with equation (2).  The diagram is incorrect.

Let $x_2$ be the number in the gray box.
Then $x_1 + x_2 = 15$, $x_2 + x_3 = 3$, $x_3+x_4 = 15$.
We have $x_1+x_2 = 7$, $x_2+x_3 = 9$, $x_3+x_4 = 11$, $x_4+x_5 = 9$, $x_5+x_6 = 8$.
The relevant equations are $x_1+x_2 = 7$ and $x_2+x_3 = 3$.  Then $x_3 = 3-x_2$.
$x_3+x_4 = 11$.
$x_2+x_3=3$, $x_3+x_4 = 15$.

Let the number in the gray box be $x$. Then $x_2=x$.
$x_1+x = 7$, $x+x_3 = 3$, $x_3+x_4 = 15$.
$x_3 = 3-x$
$3-x+x_4 = 15$
$x_4 = 12+x$.
Since the numbers must be between 1 and 9, $x_4$ must be between 1 and 9, so $12+x \leq 9$.
So $x \leq -3$. But the numbers must be between 1 and 9, so we have an error.

However, $x_2+x_3 = 3$, so $x_3 = 3-x_2 = 3-x$. Then $x_3+x_4=15$.
We also have $x_3+x_4=11$. These are contradictory. The problem is incorrect.

I suspect the sum of the numbers in two adjacent squares is written underneath the square. So let's ignore the sums above the squares.
$x_1+x_2=15$, $x_2+x_3=3$, $x_3+x_4=15$, $x_4+x_5=8$.

Let the number in the gray box be $x$. Then $x=x_2$.
$x_2+x_3 = 3$, so $x+x_3 = 3$. $x_3 = 3-x$.
$x_3+x_4 = 15$, so $3-x+x_4 = 15$. $x_4 = 12+x$.
$x_4+x_5 = 8$, so $12+x+x_5 = 8$. $x_5 = -4-x$.

Again, this is incorrect. The diagram is not correct and there seems to be contradictory information.

Let the gray square contain the value 'x'. The sum to the left is x+ value to the left =9
sum to the right is x+value to the right=11
Let 'l' be the value to the left and 'r' the value to the right.
then l + x = 9  and x + r = 11
Thus r = 11-x
Using the bottom sums for the first two blocks of squares
value 1 + x = 15   so first value is 15 -x
and the value immediately to the right of the gray square gives the sum to the value to its immediate left, is 3
ie value to the right + x =3   so r+x=3
11-x +x = 3   or 11=3    THIS IS FALSE thus question is ambiguous

Reasoning: The problem is incorrectly stated, but from $x_2 + x_3 =3$ it implies that the gray box is the third one i.e. $x_3$ and the value is 3-x. However, 3 is not an option.

Considering only that adjacent blocks values add to give a total of nine, then eleven then the average should have the value of 10, however, none of the options is that value

Let's consider some of the options, If the answer were C = 6
Then l + 6 =9 so l =3  and r+ 6=11   so r = 5

Answer: B)
