Reasoning:
The teacher calls out three sets of names:
1. Zoé, Lila, Cléo
2. Zoé, Laura, Cora
3. Alice, Laura, Cléo
Each time, only one name is correct, and it's a different name each time.

Let's analyze the possibilities:

If Zoé is the correct name in the first set, then neither Zoé nor Lila nor Cléo can be in the correct answer.
If Laura is the correct name in the second set, then neither Zoé, Laura nor Cora can be in the correct answer.
If Alice is the correct name in the third set, then neither Alice, Laura nor Cléo can be in the correct answer.

Now, consider each name from the given options and test if it can be present in the set of correct names.
A) Zoé, Laura, Cléo. From the question, these cannot be correct.
B) Alice, Laura, Cora. From the question, these cannot be correct.
C) Zoé, Lila, Cora. Could be possible.
D) Alice, Lila, Cora. Could be possible.
E) Alice, Laura, Cléo. From the question, these cannot be correct.

We can now write equations:
1. Names: X, Y, Z
2. Combinations: (Zoé, Lila, Cléo), (Zoé, Laura, Cora), (Alice, Laura, Cléo)
3. Let Zoé, Lila and Cléo be a,b,c. And Zoé, Laura and Cora be d,e,f and Alice, Laura, Cléo be g,e,c. Since we know there is only one match in each, let's deduce.

*   **First call (Zoé, Lila, Cléo):** Only one correct.  Possibilities are Zoé, Lila, or Cléo.
*   **Second call (Zoé, Laura, Cora):** Only one correct, and different from the first call. If Zoé was correct in the first call, it can't be in the second call. So only Laura or Cora possible.
*   **Third call (Alice, Laura, Cléo):** Only one correct, and different from the first two calls. If Laura was correct in the second call, it can't be in the third call. So only Alice or Cléo.

Consider Lila. The possibilities are Lila from the first call, Cora from the second and Alice from the third. Let's check:

* Assume Lila is the first correct name, Cora is the second, and Alice is the third:
    * First call correct: Lila (eliminated Zoé, Cléo).
    * Second call correct: Cora (eliminated Zoé, Laura).
    * Third call correct: Alice (eliminated Laura, Cléo).
Therefore, the names must be Alice, Lila, Cora.

Answer: D)
Reasoning: We proceed by elimination and use the given constraints to deduce the only possible set of names.
Answer: D)
