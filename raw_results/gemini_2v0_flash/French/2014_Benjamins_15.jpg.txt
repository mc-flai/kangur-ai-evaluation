Reasoning: We can observe that pieces A and E can be combined to form a square. Similarly, two pieces of type B can be combined to form a square and two pieces of type D can be combined to form a square. This means that by combining one piece each of A and E, and two pieces of type B, we get a square. Similarly, by combining one piece each of A and E, and two pieces of type D, we get a square. Thus, with pieces A, B, D, E, it is possible to form a square. This means the shape C will not be used.
Answer: C)
