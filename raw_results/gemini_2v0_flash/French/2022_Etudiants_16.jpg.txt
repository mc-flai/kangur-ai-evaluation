Reasoning: The problem requires finding the minimum number of power plants needed to supply power to all cities, where a power plant supplies power to the city it is in and all adjacent cities.
We can observe the graph and try to find an optimal placement for the power plants:

1. Place a power plant in the center of the grid. This will cover that city and 4 surrounding cities. (5 cities covered)
2. Place a power plant in a corner. This will cover that city and 2 surrounding cities. (3 cities covered).
3. If we place power plants on the grid, starting with the center, we notice that it's impossible to cover all cities with 3 power plants.
4. If we pick 4 cities, we can place the power plants strategically to cover all cities.

Here's one possible configuration for 4 power plants:
- Top-left city
- Top-right city
- Bottom-left city
- Bottom-right city

This configuration will cover all the cities.

Reasoning that 3 is too low, and experimentally trying 4, we can see it works.

Answer: B)
