Reasoning: Let's analyze the possible colorings. There are 3 colors available.
The first rectangle can be colored in 3 ways.
The second rectangle (next to the first one) can be colored in 2 ways.
The third rectangle (above the first) can be colored in 2 ways.
The fourth rectangle can be colored in 2 ways (as it is next to the second).
The fifth rectangle (below the third) can be colored in 2 ways (as it is next to the third).
However, this would require some more calculations.

Let's call the number of colorings x.

Let us try the coloring.
Top left = 1
Top middle = 2
Top right = 1
Bottom left = 2
Bottom middle = 1

If we chose Blue, Green, Red. Then the 1 = Blue, 2 = Green.

Let us start by coloring the top left corner.
The color can be blue, green, red = 3 choices.
The top middle corner = 2 choices.
The top right corner = 2 choices.
The bottom left corner = 2 choices.
The bottom middle corner = 2 choices.

We notice that top left, top right, and bottom middle should not be the same color.
Top middle and bottom left cannot be the same color.
The two rectangles at the bottom, which forms a square, must be different colors.

Let's say the upper left rectangle is colored with color X.
The upper middle rectangle is colored with color Y.
The lower left rectangle is colored with color Z.

Then the upper right can be colored with color Z.
The lower middle can be colored with color X.

So we can color the shape with three colors such that X, Y, Z are different.

Therefore, the number of colorings = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6

If we let X = Blue, Y = Green, Z = Red
Blue Green Red
Red Green Blue
Green Blue Red
Blue Red Green
Red Blue Green
Green Red Blue

If we look closely, the number of possible colorings is 12.

Reasoning: Consider the top left rectangle. It can be colored with any of the three colors. The top middle rectangle must be a different color from the top left, so it can be colored with either of the remaining two colors. The top right can be colored with the same color as the top left, or the third color that has not been used so far. The bottom left must be a different color from the top left, so we have two choices for the bottom left. The bottom middle must be different from the top middle and the bottom left, and also different from the top right, so this is where things get complicated.

Let us simplify the problem. The number of possible colorings is 18 * 2/3 = 12

Let us test a scenario:
Rectangle 1 (top left): Blue
Rectangle 2 (top middle): Green
Rectangle 3 (top right): Blue/Red
Rectangle 4 (bottom left): Green/Red
Rectangle 5 (bottom middle): Blue/Red/Green

So 12 colorings.

Answer: E)
