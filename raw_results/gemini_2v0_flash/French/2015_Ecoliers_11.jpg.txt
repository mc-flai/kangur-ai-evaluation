Reasoning:
Let x be the number of bananas Youri gave to Louis.
Initially, Louis has 7 apples and 2 bananas.
Louis gives 2 apples to Youri, so Louis has 7 - 2 = 5 apples.
Youri gives x bananas to Louis, so Louis has 2 + x bananas.
Louis then has the same number of apples and bananas, so 5 = 2 + x.
Therefore, x = 5 - 2 = 3.
So, Youri gave Louis 3 bananas.

Answer: B)
