Reasoning:
We are given that 12500 containers stretch over 75 kilometers. We want to find the length of one container.

First, we need to convert the kilometers to meters: 75 km = 75 * 1000 m = 75000 m.

Next, we divide the total length by the number of containers: 75000 m / 12500 containers = 6 m/container.

Therefore, the length of one container is 6 meters.
