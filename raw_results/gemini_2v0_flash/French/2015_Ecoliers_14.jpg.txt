Reasoning: The question states that the top-down view of the umbrella has the word KANGAROO written on it. We must find which of the diagrams also has KANGAROO on the top of the umbrella. Since the word is printed symmetrically, reading from one letter to the next one is possible, and we have the word KANGAROO on the top of the umbrella. We can see that drawing 'A' has the letters 'KANG' on it, so it's the right option.
