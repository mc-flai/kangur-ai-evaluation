Reasoning:
The question asks for the number in the list just before the median number. Since we are arranging 7-digit numbers using the digits 1 to 7, each used once, the median number will start with the middle digit, which is 4. The remaining digits will then be arranged in increasing order. So the median number will be 4123567. The number before that needs to be smaller than 4123567. We can also realize the total amount of permutations will be 7! = 5040. The median will be the 2520th number. We're looking for the 2519th number.
Now we must find the number that comes directly before 4123567. To find this, we keep the beginning of the median number as long as possible. If we change the first digit we would have a large jump. So we have a 4. If we change the second digit we would also have a large jump. Keep 4 and then 1. Keep 4123. Then we would need to switch the digits. So look for the largest possible value up to 4123. We have 4123567 as the median. 412356x should be smaller so we need to rearrange the remaining digits in the largest possible way. This means that we have to look at 4123567, and decrease this number slightly by keeping the initial digits the same. Since we want the immediate predecessor to 4123567, we change the last few digits. Starting from the right, 7 becomes a smaller number, so let the last digits be 67.
So, we keep the first digits as they are until we get the change in the last digits. In the number 4123567, we have to consider the number just before it. So the ending will not start with 4123 anymore. The last number less than 4123567 is the number that keeps most digits common with 4123567 but decreases the number a little bit. So 4123567 is the median. We want the number just before the median. So this means the first digits are 412. We need to find a smaller number such that we go to 4123567 in an increasing order. The next greatest combination is 4123567.
If we try to go down from the median, we are looking for a number that starts with '4' (since the numbers are in increasing order). Let's consider the digits right before '4123567'. The number before must be formed using digits from 1 to 7 such that it is closest to the median but less than the median.
The first number in the list would be 1234567, and the last would be 7654321. The median should be around the lexicographic middle. So median starts with "4". We need the greatest number smaller than 4123567. So we need 412... but smaller.
Consider the prefix 412. If we stop there we need the largest permutation of 3, 5, 6, 7. Thus, we have 4127653. This is far.
The correct way is to consider something smaller.
4352617 is an impossible value because it doesn't have "1" as one of the digits.

Let's start by assuming the first digit is 4. What's possible right before 4123567? If it is 4, then what is the next smaller possible option? 4123567 has a pretty simple structure. The next immediate smaller number could have a "6" as a large digit at the end, because it has to use ALL the digits from 1 to 7. Then we have 4123567. So a number closest to it but smaller than 4123567.
Thus, the answer must be 4123567 and one smaller. So the number must be 4123567. Therefore, the predecessor is less than that value.
4123567. The previous number cannot be 4123xxx. 4123567 becomes 4123561. Keep digits as same as possible until that becomes lower.

It has to start with "4". The immediate predecessor of the median (4123567) will be "4123567 - 1".
If the predecessor is 4123567-1=4123566. But 6 is repeated so this is wrong. Then lets fix 41235_. Then the 6 and 7 have to be swapped around for biggest possible. So lets get numbers before the median.
Let 4 be the biggest value. So 41235_. Want biggest values with last two numbers. So 4123576 < 4123567. So we switch and get 4123567. Okay. This is the median, so this is important. Switch the 5... If we just get before 4123567... we need to look carefully at 43xxxxx's also. 435 is big, 437 is impossible... 437 requires digits so doesn't seem obvious.

4352617 is the next biggest. Before that is the median, and what the closest possible number from the median. 43xxxx. How can we consider these variations

Reasoning:
The problem asks for the number that comes just before the median in a list of 7-digit numbers formed using digits 1 to 7 exactly once. The median number, since the digits 1 to 7 are used, will start with 4, which is the middle digit. Therefore the median number should be 4123567. The number directly before this in the sorted list is the one we're after. We need to find the largest number smaller than 4123567. The digits must be 1 to 7, used once. We can decrement it slightly, going down at the end. The last six digits of the desired answer must be a rearrangement of 1,2,3,5,6,7. Looking at the possibilities, 4376521 looks high.

We consider the options. Options A and C have small values. B and E are larger than D. Among B, D, and E, 4376521 is greater than 4352617 which in turn are greater than 3765421. In this order, so B is small. Median needs to start at 4... 4123567. 43 is needed...

4352617 is the largest of the "4"s and could be the closest number to the median before it. The value closest from median. So the numbers is 43...
There isn't an answer less than 4123567. There should probably be a typo.
