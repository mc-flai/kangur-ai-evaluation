Reasoning: The umbrella has the word KANGAROO written around the edges. We must determine which of the options doesn't have the letters of KANGAROO.
A) has letters G, N, A
B) has letters G, A, R
C) has letters O, K, O
D) has letters A, G, N
E) has letters O, R, A
Looking at the umbrella on the right, we can see the letters of KANGAROO are present in that order going clockwise, or counterclockwise. All of the options A-E do use letters in KANGAROO. However, B has G, A, R in that order clockwise. Option A has G, A, N, which are adjacent in KANGAROO, but in the incorrect order. Option C has K, O, O. Option D has G, A, N, adjacent, but out of order. And option E has O, R, A, adjacent but incorrect order.

Option A has the letters N, G, A which are in the word KANGAROO, but they are not in the correct sequential order that they appear in the word KANGAROO. So option A is incorrect.
Option B has the letters G, A, R, and they are in the correct sequential order. So option B is incorrect.
Option C has the letters O, K, O, they are in the correct sequential order. So option C is incorrect.
Option D has the letters A, G, N, they are not in the correct sequential order. So option D is incorrect.
Option E has the letters R, O, A, they are in the correct sequential order. So option E is incorrect.

The task asks "Which of the following drawings is not from my umbrella?", implying the letters will be out of order. From the original umbrella, we know the letters go in the order KANGAROO.
Option A: GNA. The order of the letters are out of order.
Option B: GAR. The order of the letters are out of order.
Option C: OKO. The order of the letters are out of order.
Option D: AGN. The order of the letters are out of order.
Option E: ROA. The order of the letters are out of order.

Looking closely at the umbrella shown at the top right, the letters are arranged in the order:
G, A, N, ..., A, K, O, ... R, O, ...
Option A: N, ..., G, A (Not in the correct relative positions)
Option B: A, ..., G, R (Not in the correct relative positions)
Option C: O, K, O (These letters are grouped)
Option D: A, G, N (These letters are grouped)
Option E: O, R, A (Not in the correct relative positions)

The option that is not present would be one where the letters are in a significantly different arrangement or order.

Reasoning: Looking at the umbrella from above, the letters are arranged in this cyclical order: G A N G A R O O K.
The option that will NOT be the one from the umbrella will be the one whose letter's order is completely incorrect relative to each other.

A) GNA. We can find these three letters in order: GAN
B) GAR. We can find these three letters in order: GAR
C) OKO. We can find these three letters in order: OKO
D) AGN. We can find these three letters in order: ANG
E) ROA. We cannot find this precise sequence of letters. RO is available but separated.

Reasoning:
The word written is KANGAROO. Thus, the letters on the umbrellas must be in that cyclical order. The only option that contains letters in a different order is Option A which shows the letters N, G, and A but, as you traverse the umbrella clockwise, the letters will appear as G-A-N, which does not match the order displayed on Option A. Thus, the answer must be Option A.

Answer: A)
