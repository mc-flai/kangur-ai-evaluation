Reasoning:
The question states that the sum of three distinct positive integers is 7. We need to find the product of these three integers.
Possible combinations of three distinct positive integers that sum to 7 are:
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
1 + 3 + 3 = 7 (but the integers must be distinct)

Therefore, the only combination that works is 1, 2, and 4.
The product is 1 * 2 * 4 = 8.
