Reasoning:
Let the given equation be
$$f(x) + 2f(\frac{2015}{x}) = 4x$$
We want to find $f(5)$. Substitute $x=5$ into the equation:
$$f(5) + 2f(\frac{2015}{5}) = 4(5)$$
$$f(5) + 2f(403) = 20$$
Now, substitute $x = 403$ into the given equation:
$$f(403) + 2f(\frac{2015}{403}) = 4(403)$$
Since $\frac{2015}{403} = 5$, we have
$$f(403) + 2f(5) = 1612$$
So we have a system of two equations with two unknowns $f(5)$ and $f(403)$:
$$f(5) + 2f(403) = 20$$
$$f(403) + 2f(5) = 1612$$
From the first equation, we have $2f(403) = 20 - f(5)$, so $f(403) = 10 - \frac{1}{2}f(5)$.
Substitute this into the second equation:
$$10 - \frac{1}{2}f(5) + 2f(5) = 1612$$
$$\frac{3}{2}f(5) = 1602$$
$$f(5) = \frac{2}{3}(1602) = 2(534) = 1068$$
