Reasoning: The question asks for the integer part of $\sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20}}}}$.
First, we can approximate $\sqrt{20}$. Since $4^2 = 16$ and $5^2 = 25$, we have $4 < \sqrt{20} < 5$. We can use the approximation $\sqrt{20} \approx 4.5$.
Then $\sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20}} \approx \sqrt{20 + 4.5} = \sqrt{24.5}$. Since $4^2 = 16$ and $5^2 = 25$, we have $4 < \sqrt{24.5} < 5$. More precisely, $\sqrt{24.5} \approx 4.95$.
Next, $\sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20}}} \approx \sqrt{20 + 4.95} = \sqrt{24.95}$. Since $4^2 = 16$ and $5^2 = 25$, we have $4 < \sqrt{24.95} < 5$. And $\sqrt{24.95} \approx 4.995$.
Finally, $\sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20}}}} \approx \sqrt{20 + 4.995} = \sqrt{24.995}$. Since $4^2 = 16$ and $5^2 = 25$, we have $4 < \sqrt{24.995} < 5$. Also $\sqrt{24.995} \approx 4.9995$.
Thus, the integer part is 4.

Alternatively, let $x = \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20}}}}$.
Then $4 < \sqrt{20} < 5$. Thus, $24 < 20 + \sqrt{20} < 25$, and $\sqrt{24} < \sqrt{20+\sqrt{20}} < \sqrt{25} = 5$. Since $\sqrt{24} \approx 4.9$, $4.9 < \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20}} < 5$.
Then $24.9 < 20 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20}} < 25$, and $\sqrt{24.9} < \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20}}} < 5$. Since $\sqrt{24.9} \approx 4.99$, $4.99 < \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20}}} < 5$.
Then $24.99 < 20 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20}}} < 25$, and $\sqrt{24.99} < \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20}}}} < 5$.
Since $\sqrt{24.99} \approx 4.999$, $4.999 < x < 5$. Thus the integer part of $x$ is 4.

Reasoning: The value inside keeps getting closer to 5, but remains lower than 5. This leads to the value of the entire expression being lower than 5. Thus the integer part is 4.
