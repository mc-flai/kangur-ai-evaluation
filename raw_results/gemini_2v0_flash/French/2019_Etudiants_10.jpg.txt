Reasoning:
Let's analyze the possible number of members last year: from 31 to 37. This year, the number of members increased by exactly 20%.

If there were 31 members, then the increase is 31 * 0.2 = 6.2, so the number of members this year is 31 + 6.2 = 37.2, which is not an integer.
If there were 32 members, then the increase is 32 * 0.2 = 6.4, so the number of members this year is 32 + 6.4 = 38.4, which is not an integer.
If there were 33 members, then the increase is 33 * 0.2 = 6.6, so the number of members this year is 33 + 6.6 = 39.6, which is not an integer.
If there were 34 members, then the increase is 34 * 0.2 = 6.8, so the number of members this year is 34 + 6.8 = 40.8, which is not an integer.
If there were 35 members, then the increase is 35 * 0.2 = 7, so the number of members this year is 35 + 7 = 42.
If there were 36 members, then the increase is 36 * 0.2 = 7.2, so the number of members this year is 36 + 7.2 = 43.2, which is not an integer.
If there were 37 members, then the increase is 37 * 0.2 = 7.4, so the number of members this year is 37 + 7.4 = 44.4, which is not an integer.

Since the number of members must be an integer, the only possibility is that there were 35 members last year, and 42 members this year.
