Let $S$ be the purchase price of the sculpture and $T$ be the purchase price of the painting.
The selling price of the sculpture is $1.4S$ and the selling price of the painting is $1.6T$.
The total selling price is $1.4S + 1.6T$, and this is 54% greater than the total purchase price $S + T$.
Therefore, $1.4S + 1.6T = 1.54(S + T)$.
$1.4S + 1.6T = 1.54S + 1.54T$
$1.6T - 1.54T = 1.54S - 1.4S$
$0.06T = 0.14S$
$\frac{S}{T} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} = \frac{6}{14} = \frac{3}{7}$

Reasoning: We set up an equation based on the given information, relating the purchase prices of the sculpture and painting. We then solved for the ratio of the sculpture's price to the painting's price.
Answer: C)
