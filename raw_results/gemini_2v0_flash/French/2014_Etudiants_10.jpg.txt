Reasoning:
The question asks for the ratio of the volume of the combined cylinder to the volume of one of the original cylinders. Since the two original cylinders are identical, when they are combined along the dashed line, the new cylinder has double the volume of either of the originals. Therefore, the ratio of the volume of the large cylinder to one of the original cylinders is 2:1, or simply 2.
