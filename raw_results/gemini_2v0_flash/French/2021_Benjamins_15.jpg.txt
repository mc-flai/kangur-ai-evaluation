Reasoning:
The problem states that Marc folds a piece of paper in half, and then folds it in half again. The final shape is a small right isosceles triangle.
If the initial shape was P, then the first fold would be along the longer side, and the second fold would be along the shorter side to get a shape of triangle. It won't be right triangle.
If the initial shape was Q, then first fold would be along its height, and second fold would be along its width. Finally we will get a triangle that is right isosceles.
If the initial shape was R, which is a right isosceles triangle, then the first fold will be to match the equal edges, and second fold will be along the longer edge of the right isosceles triangle.

Therefore, only Q can produce the final described triangle.

Answer: B)
