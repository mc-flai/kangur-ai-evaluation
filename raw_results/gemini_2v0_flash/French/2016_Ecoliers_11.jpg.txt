Reasoning: The question asks for the next year after 2016 where the sum of its digits is 9. We need to check each of the options:
A) 2007: 2 + 0 + 0 + 7 = 9. But 2007 < 2016, so this is not a valid answer.
B) 2034: 2 + 0 + 3 + 4 = 9. 2034 > 2016, so this could be the answer.
C) 2108: 2 + 1 + 0 + 8 = 11. This is not the answer.
D) 2025: 2 + 0 + 2 + 5 = 9. 2025 > 2016, so this could be the answer.
E) 2134: 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 10. This is not the answer.

Now we need to compare B and D to see which is the smaller year that is greater than 2016. 2025 < 2034, thus 2025 is the next year after 2016 where the sum of the digits is 9.

Answer: D)
