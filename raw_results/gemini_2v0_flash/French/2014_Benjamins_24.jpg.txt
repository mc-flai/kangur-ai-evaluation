Reasoning: Today it's raining. This means yesterday and the day before yesterday were sunny. Also, 5 days after a sunny day, there's another sunny day.
- Today: Rain
- Yesterday: Sun
- Day Before Yesterday: Sun
- Tomorrow: We don't know (it could be sun or rain).
- The day after tomorrow: Since yesterday was sunny, we know that 5 days after that, there'll be a sunny day, which is in 4 days from now.
Therefore, we can only predict the weather with certainty for today.
