Reasoning: The question asks how many dark triangles on the right side of the dotted line will overlap a dark triangle on the left side when the paper is folded.
- Row 1: The dark triangle on the right will not overlap a dark triangle on the left.
- Row 2: The dark triangle on the right will overlap a dark triangle on the left.
- Row 3: The dark triangle on the right will not overlap a dark triangle on the left.
Therefore, only 1 dark triangle from the right will overlap a dark triangle on the left.

Answer: B)
