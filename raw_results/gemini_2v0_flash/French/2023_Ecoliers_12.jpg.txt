Reasoning: The problem states that Rose has five objects with masses 12g, 15g, 27g, 29g, and 56g. She places three objects on one side of the balance and one object on the other, and the balance is in equilibrium. We need to determine the mass of the object that was left out. We can test each of the given masses to see if the remaining four masses can be divided into groups of 3 and 1 that will balance.

If we remove 12g: The remaining masses are 15, 27, 29, 56. 15 + 27 + 29 = 71. 71 != 56
If we remove 15g: The remaining masses are 12, 27, 29, 56. 12 + 27 + 29 = 68. 68 != 56
If we remove 27g: The remaining masses are 12, 15, 29, 56. 12 + 15 + 29 = 56. 56 = 56.

So if the 27g object is left out, the other four objects can be divided into a group of three (12, 15, 29) and a group of one (56) that balance.
