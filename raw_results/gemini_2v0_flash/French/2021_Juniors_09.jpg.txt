Reasoning:
Let 'x' be the number of goals scored by our team after the half-time, and 'y' be the number of goals scored by the opposing team after the half-time.
From the question, we know that x = 2y. We also know that we won by 1 goal.
So, our final score is 9 + x, and the opponent's final score is 14 + y.
Since we won by 1 goal, (9 + x) - (14 + y) = 1
Substituting x = 2y into the equation: 9 + 2y - 14 - y = 1
Simplifying, y - 5 = 1, which gives us y = 6.
Then, x = 2y = 2 * 6 = 12.
Our final score is 9 + x = 9 + 12 = 21.
The opponent's final score is 14 + y = 14 + 6 = 20.
The final result is 21 to 20.
