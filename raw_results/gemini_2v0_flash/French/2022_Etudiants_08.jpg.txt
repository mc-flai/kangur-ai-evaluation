Reasoning: The perimeter of the shaded region consists of three arcs. Each arc is formed by two intersecting circles of radius 1. The angle formed at the center of each circle by the arc is 2π/3 because the intersecting circles are placed such that the centers of the circles form an equilateral triangle. Since the radius is 1, the length of each arc is (2π/3)*1 = 2π/3. There are three arcs so the total perimeter is 3*(2π/3) = 2π. Therefore, w = 2π.

Answer: E)
