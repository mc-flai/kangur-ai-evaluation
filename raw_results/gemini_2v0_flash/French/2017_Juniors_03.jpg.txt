Reasoning:
Margot has 24 euros, and each of her three sisters has 12 euros.
There are four people in total: Margot and her three sisters. The total amount of money they have is 24 + 3 * 12 = 24 + 36 = 60 euros.
To have the same amount of money, each person needs to have 60 / 4 = 15 euros.
Each sister needs 15 - 12 = 3 euros.
Therefore, Margot needs to give 3 euros to each sister.
