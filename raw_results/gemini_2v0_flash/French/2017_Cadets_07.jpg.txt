Reasoning: The problem states that there are four hearts with areas 16, 9, 4, and 1 cm². The hearts are placed on top of each other. The question asks for the area of the visible grey part. In the image, we can observe that the grey part is the difference between the largest heart (16 cm²) and the second largest (9 cm²), plus the difference between the heart with area 4 cm² and the smallest one (1 cm²).

Therefore, the visible grey area is (16 - 9) + (4 - 1) = 7 + 3 = 10 cm².
