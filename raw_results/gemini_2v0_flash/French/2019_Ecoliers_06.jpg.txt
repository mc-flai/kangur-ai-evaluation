Reasoning: The square contains various symbols. We need to find a piece that can be found inside the square. Options A to E are all 1x2 rectangles, so they are 2 squares side by side.
Option A: The piece consists of a clover and a diamond. We can find it in the square in the first column, first and second rows.
Option B: The piece consists of two clovers. This is not a possible piece as the piece consists of a clover and a spade.
Option C: The piece consists of a diamond and a spade. We can find it in the square in the second column, second and third rows.
Option D: The piece consists of a spade and a heart. We can find it in the second row, third column, and third row, second column, respectively.
Option E: The piece consists of two hearts. We can find it in the first row, second column and third row, first column, respectively.

The piece described in the question is two squares joined. From the five options, there is an option that can be formed by joining the club and the diamond together. Option A shows a clover and a diamond, which can be extracted from the top left corner of the larger square (first column, first and second rows).
