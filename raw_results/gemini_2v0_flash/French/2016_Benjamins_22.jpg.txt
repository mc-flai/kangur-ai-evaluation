Reasoning:
The 21st century spans the years 2001-2100. We need to find dates in the form DD.MM.YYYY where all 8 digits are different. The year must start with "20".
So we have DD.MM.20YY.
Since the year starts with "20", we can only have the digits 0 and 2 in the year.
Let's try to create some dates.
Possible months: 01, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 12
Possible years: 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019.
We are looking for dates where all 8 digits are different.
Possible dates:
01.02.2034 - Invalid, month only goes up to 12.
03.04.2015
04.03.2015
05.03.2014
06.03.2014
07.03.2014
08.03.2014
09.03.2014
12.03.2045
13.04.2056
We are restricted to using digits 0, 1, 2 for the year, which severely limits the possible dates.

Let's analyze possible years.
Year = 20XY. We can choose from {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} for X and Y.

Consider the year 2013.
The month must be 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
The date cannot be 2 or 1 or 3 or 0.
DD.MM.2013
Valid month/date combination has to contain 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
Consider the year 2014.
The month must be 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
The date cannot be 2 or 1 or 4 or 0.

Possible dates include 2045, 2046, 2047, 2048, 2049.
We require 8 different digits.

Let us evaluate the dates that can be in the 21st century in the form DD.MM.YYYY such that all the digits are unique.
The century ranges from 2001 to 2100. So the years are of the form 20ab or 21ab.
Since the first two digits are restricted to 20 or 21, there is very little choice to have unique 8 digits.
There are no such dates in the 21st century.
Consider 02.03.2014, 04.03.2015
This means the total number of such dates are 0.

Answer: A)
Reasoning: The 21st century is from 2001 to 2100. A "surprenante" date must have 8 distinct digits when written as DD.MM.YYYY. Since every year in the 21st century begins with either "20" or "21," the dates are constrained to using these digits. There are no dates in the 21st century where all 8 digits are different.
Answer: A)
