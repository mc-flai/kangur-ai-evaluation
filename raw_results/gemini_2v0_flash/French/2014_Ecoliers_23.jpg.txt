Reasoning: The figure has 25 squares. The goal is to color as many squares as possible without having any 2x2 squares fully colored. We can color every other square in a checkerboard pattern. Consider the rows and columns. If you color every other square, you will color approximately half of the squares. However, we need to make sure we don't create any 2x2 colored squares. By carefully coloring squares, it's possible to color more than half. If we alternate rows, we have 3 fully colored rows, which will violate the rule. It is possible to shade squares such that no 2x2 squares are all shaded. If we leave one empty square at each corner, then there will be 21 squares shaded. Then let's consider alternating the coloring in each row and column. If the central column is empty, we can color the surrounding squares in each row to a total of 21 shaded squares. If we choose one more to shade, we will have 22 and will produce an overlapping 2x2. So the maximum is 21.
