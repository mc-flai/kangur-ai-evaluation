Reasoning:
We know that 1 liter of water occupies a volume of 1000 cubic centimeters (cm^3). Also, 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters. Therefore, 1 square meter is equal to (100 cm) * (100 cm) = 10,000 cm^2.
We are given that 15 liters of water fell per square meter. This means that for every 10,000 cm^2, there were 15 * 1000 cm^3 of water.
Let h be the height the water level rose in centimeters. Then, the volume of water is given by the area times the height, so 10,000 cm^2 * h = 15,000 cm^3.
Solving for h:
h = 15,000 cm^3 / 10,000 cm^2 = 1.5 cm.
