Reasoning:
We are asked to find the units digit of the product (5^5 + 1)(5^10 + 1)(5^15 + 1).
Any power of 5 will have a units digit of 5. So, 5^5, 5^10, and 5^15 all have a units digit of 5.
Therefore, 5^5 + 1 has a units digit of 5+1=6.
5^10 + 1 has a units digit of 5+1=6.
5^15 + 1 has a units digit of 5+1=6.
The product of the units digits is 6*6*6 = 36*6 = 216. The units digit of this product is 6.
