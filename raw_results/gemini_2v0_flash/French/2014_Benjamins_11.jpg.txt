Reasoning:
Let's count the number of grey and black squares in the grid.
Grey squares = 4 full squares + 4 half squares = 4 + 2 = 6 squares.
Black squares = 3 full squares + 4 half squares = 3 + 2 = 5 squares.
The number of grey squares is 6 and black squares is 5.
The difference between grey and black areas = 6 - 5 = 1 square.
To make the area of grey squares equal to the area of black squares, we need to add a square that is fully black to the last position.
So adding a fully black square would make the area of black squares equal to 6, which is the area of the grey squares.

Answer: B)
