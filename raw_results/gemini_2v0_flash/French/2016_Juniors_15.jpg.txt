Reasoning:
Let $f(x) = ax$ since $f$ is a linear function.
Let $g(x) = bx + c$ since $g$ is an affine function.
Given $f(2) = g(2) = 4$, we have $2a = 4$, so $a = 2$. Thus $f(x) = 2x$.
Given $f(3) = -g(3)$, we have $2(3) = -g(3)$, so $6 = -(3b+c)$.
Also, $g(2) = 2b + c = 4$.
We have two equations:
$3b + c = -6$
$2b + c = 4$
Subtracting the second equation from the first:
$3b + c - (2b + c) = -6 - 4$
$b = -10$
Substitute $b = -10$ into $2b + c = 4$:
$2(-10) + c = 4$
$-20 + c = 4$
$c = 24$
So $g(x) = -10x + 24$.
Then $g(1) = -10(1) + 24 = -10 + 24 = 14$.
