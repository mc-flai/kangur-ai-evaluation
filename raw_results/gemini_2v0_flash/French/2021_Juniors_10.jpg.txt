Reasoning:
The area of the shaded square is 9 m², so the side length of the square is √9 = 3 m. Let the length and width of the large rectangle be L and W respectively. The perimeter of the large rectangle is 2(L + W) = 30 m, so L + W = 15 m.
The length of rectangle KLMN is L - 3, and the width of rectangle KLMN is W - 3.
The perimeter of rectangle KLMN is 2(L - 3 + W - 3) = 2(L + W - 6) = 2(15 - 6) = 2(9) = 18 m.
