Reasoning:
Let the side length of the equilateral triangle IJK be $s$. Therefore, $3s = p$, or $s = p/3$.
Since triangles IHF, GFH, and FGK are isosceles with equal sides, let the equal sides be $x$.
The four triangles GFK, GFH, IHF, and IJK have the same perimeter $p$.
For triangle IJK, each side is $s = p/3$.
For triangle GFH, sides are $x, x, FH$. Perimeter: $2x + FH = p$.
For triangle IHF, sides are $x, x, IF$. Perimeter: $2x + IF = p$.
For triangle FGK, sides are $x, x, FK$. Perimeter: $2x + FK = p$.
Also $IF=FJ=FK=s = p/3$.
So $2x + s = p$
$2x + p/3 = p$
$2x = 2p/3$
$x = p/3$
The sides of pentagon GHIJK are GH, HI, IJ, JK, KG.
$IJ = JK = KI = p/3$
Since IHF and GFH and FGK are isosceles with equal sides and perimeter p, we have x = p/3, so IH = HG = GK = p/3.
The perimeter of pentagon GHIJK is GH + HI + IJ + JK + KG = x + x + s + s + x = 3x + 2s
= 3(p/3) + 2(p/3)
= p + 2p/3 = 5p/3
