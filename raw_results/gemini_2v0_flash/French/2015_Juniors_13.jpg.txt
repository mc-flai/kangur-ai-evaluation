Reasoning: The question asks which number is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube.

A) 6^13: The exponent is not divisible by 2 or 3, thus it's neither a square nor a cube.
B) 5^12: The exponent is divisible by 2 (12/2=6) and by 3 (12/3=4), so it's both a square and a cube. (5^12 = (5^6)^2 = (5^4)^3).
C) 4^11 = (2^2)^11 = 2^22. The exponent 22 is divisible by 2 (22/2=11) so it is a square.
D) 3^10: The exponent is divisible by 2 (10/2 = 5) so it's a square (3^10 = (3^5)^2).
E) 2^9: The exponent is divisible by 3 (9/3=3) so it's a cube.

The only number that cannot be expressed as either a square or a cube is 6^13.
