Reasoning:
To maximize the result of KAN - GOU - ROU, we need to maximize KAN and minimize GOU and ROU.
The digits available are 1 to 7.
To maximize KAN, we need to assign the highest possible digits to K, A, and N. So, let K = 7, A = 6, N = 5. Then KAN = 765.
To minimize GOU and ROU, we need to assign the lowest possible digits to G, O, U, and R.
The digits left are 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Let G = 1, O = 2, U = 3. Then GOU = 123.
Let R = 4, O = 2, U = 3. Then ROU = 423.
KAN - GOU - ROU = 765 - 123 - 423 = 765 - 546 = 219.
However, if GOU = 132 and ROU = 231, then KAN - GOU - ROU = 765 - 132 - 231 = 765 - 363 = 402. This is already bigger than all options except 407.

Let's try K = 7, A = 6, N = 4. Then KAN = 764.
Let R = 1, O = 2, U = 3, G = 5. Then GOU = 523 and ROU = 123.
KAN - GOU - ROU = 764 - 523 - 123 = 764 - 646 = 118.
If we take the biggest numbers available and make K = 7, A = 5, N = 6 (or another order), then KAN = 756.
To subtract we need the smallest numbers possible assigned to G, R, O and U.
To make the negative part as small as possible we use O =1 and U = 2
If R = 3, then G could be 4 and:
KAN - GOU - ROU = 756 - 412 - 312 = 756 - 724 = 32
So, we can try to maximize KAN - GOU - ROU
The numbers 1 to 7 are allowed.
Let's make A =1.
Let's test the options.
If KAN - GOU - ROU = 407
If K=7 A=6 then N can at most be 5: KAN=765. Now to minimise the other part we must minimise. K=7. A=6
KAN - GOU - ROU
7 6 5 -123 -423 =765- 546=219
Consider the expression KAN-(GOU+ROU). Since "O" and "U" are repeated in both to be subtracted numbers assign them small values.
Set them to O=1 and U =2 Then try values for K,A,N: Then try G and R as needed. This can be an easier technique to reduce calculation than to solve for numbers iteratively.
If K=7; A=5; N=4 then 754- (G12 +R12)=407 G12+R12=347 If we take the least possible number for G (numbering it as 3 since this not available.)
There has to be different letters.

764-523-123=407 is not valid since you'd use 1,2,3,4,5,6,7

Let's try option E: 407
If we get 407 as an answer then 7,0 and something can be numbers assigned. The numbers we can pick from are 1->7. There's no 0 available to assign. Thus 407 is never an option.
Let's consider option D: 397
If K is 7, A is 5, N is 4, KAN=754.
Need to find GOU + ROU to be 754 - 397 = 357
Let's consider option C: 394
If K is 7, A is 5, N is 4, KAN=754.
Need to find GOU + ROU to be 754 - 394 = 360
If O and U are the smallest possible 1 and 2
X12+Y12 =360
X+Y should thus be 348 -> Possible.
After extensive calculations.
A valid combination is 765 - 132-24 = 609. (Not valid since numbers greater than available range.)
If we take K = 7. Thus the starting number of solution has to be in the 700's.

After further review:
Let's maximize KAN by setting K=7, A=6, N=5. So KAN=765.
We want to minimize GOU and ROU. Since U and O are repeated we need small numbers. Let U=1, O=2.
So, R and G will be 3 and 4 in some order.
If G=3 and R=4, then GOU=321 and ROU = 421.
KAN - GOU - ROU = 765 - 321 - 421 = 765 - 742 = 23.
This strategy is failing. Instead we should reduce the negative part (GOU + ROU) using larger numbers since small adjustments in KAN are more impactful on the final value.

To get 407 as an option then one calculation
7- 2 values. We select largest option.

Reasoning: After exhausting other alternatives, and reviewing the strategy. Let the final number we wish to get be 407.
This leaves only the numbers 1 -> 7. K can be any of these except zero. And K must be as great as possible in order to be most close. We thus pick the option nearest.
