Reasoning: To prevent access between the two gray islands, we need to cut the connecting paths. The shortest path between the two islands goes through a chain of bridges. By observing the diagram, we can remove 2 bridges and the islands will be disconnected. For instance, you can remove the bridge that directly connects the top gray island to the upper-right white island, then remove the bridge that connects the bottom gray island to the bottom-left white island. There would be no path between them at this point. Therefore, the answer is B) 2.

Answer: B)
