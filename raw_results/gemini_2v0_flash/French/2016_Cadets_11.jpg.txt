Reasoning:
First, we know that 45 teachers represent 60% of the total number of teachers. Let 'T' be the total number of teachers. So, 0.60 * T = 45.  To find the total number of teachers, we divide 45 by 0.60, which equals 75.
Now we know that 12% of the total teachers come by car. We need to find 12% of 75. So, 0.12 * 75 = 9. Therefore, 9 teachers come by car.
