Reasoning:
The current reading on the water meter is 91.876 m³. We need to find the next reading where all five digits are different. We can start by incrementing the last digit. The next number is 91.877. Since we have two 7s, this doesn't work. We try 91.878. This works since we have two 8s. 91.879 this works. 91.880. This has two 8s. 91.881 has two 8s and one 1.
We need to go to 91.890. Now we have a 9, 1, 8, 0. We need the last digit to be different from these 4. So we can choose any number like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Let's pick 2. So the new reading will be 91.892. The increase will be 91.892 - 91.876 = 0.016. This is not on the options.

Instead of directly choosing, consider the closest value on the meter that has all different digits.
The current reading is 91.876. Let's start incrementing the last digit, until we find the minimum number such that all the five digits are different.
91.876, 91.877(not all digits are different), 91.878(not all digits are different), 91.879(all digits are different)
91.879 - 91.876 = 0.003 m³
Then we continue on checking with our smallest result in mind.

We need a different strategy to find a suitable five-digit reading. Notice that options A, B, C, D and E correspond to increments to the current counter reading. Adding them will lead to the smallest value whose five digits are different.

A) 91.876 + 0.006 = 91.882 (two eights)
B) 91.876 + 0.034 = 91.910 (two ones and two nines)
C) 91.876 + 0.086 = 91.962 (all different)
D) 91.876 + 0.137 = 92.013 (all different)
E) 91.876 + 0.425 = 92.301 (all different)

Between options C, D and E, option C yields the closest reading where the five digits are different. The next occurrence where the five digits are all different is 91.962. Thus 91.962-91.876 = 0.086.

Answer: C)
