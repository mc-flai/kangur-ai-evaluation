Reasoning:
We have three doors and only one statement is true. Let's analyze each door:

*   **Door A:** "The tiger is not behind this door." If this statement is true, the tiger is behind door B or C.
*   **Door B:** "The tiger is behind this door." If this statement is true, then door A and C must be false.
*   **Door C:** "The sum of the three angles of a triangle is 360Â°." This statement is false since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

Since only one statement can be true, Door C is false. Then either Door A or Door B is the correct one.

If door A is true, the tiger is behind Door B or Door C. But since door C is false, then the tiger must be behind Door B. This would mean both Door A and Door B are true, so Door A must be false.

So Door A is false and Door C is false. Therefore, Door B is the correct and only true answer.

Answer: B)
