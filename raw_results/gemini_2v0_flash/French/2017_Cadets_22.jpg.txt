Reasoning:
The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. We want to find three different integer angles that sum to 180, and we want to minimize the sum of the smallest and largest angle.
To minimize the sum of the smallest and largest angle, we should try to make the angles as close as possible to each other.
Let the angles be $a < b < c$, where $a, b, c$ are integers. We want to minimize $a + c$ such that $a + b + c = 180$.
We try to find angles close to $180/3 = 60$. Let's start with $a=1$.
If $a = 1$, we want $b+c=179$ and $1 < b < c$.
$b$ can be $89$, and $c$ can be $90$. Then $a+c = 1 + 90 = 91$.
So, the angles are $1, 89, 90$. This is possible.
We want the smallest possible value for $a + c$, so we look for angles closer to 60.
If $a = 59$, then $b$ must be greater than 59, say $b = 60$. Then $c = 180 - 59 - 60 = 61$.
Then $a+c = 59+61=120$.
Try angles 58, 59, x. Then $58+59+x=180$, $x = 180 - 117 = 63$. So $58 < 59 < 63$, and $58+63 = 121$.
We want to minimize $a+c$, so let's start with small values of $a$. The smallest value for $a$ is 1.
If $a=1$, then $b+c = 179$. Since $a < b < c$, we must have $b \ge 2$.
To minimize $a+c$, we want to minimize $c$. If we take $b$ to be close to $c$, then $c$ will be small.
Let $c=b+1$. Then $2b+1 = 179$, so $2b=178$ and $b=89$. Thus, $c=90$. The angles are $1, 89, 90$. $1+89+90 = 180$. $a+c = 1+90 = 91$.

Consider the integers $59, 60, 61$. These are close to 60.
$59+60+61 = 180$. So $a=59, b=60, c=61$. The sum $a+c=59+61 = 120$.
But we are looking for distinct integer values.
If we have $1, 2, ...$. We need $a+b+c = 180$.
The smallest possible values are $1, 2$. $1+2+c=180$, so $c = 177$. Sum $a+c = 1+177=178$. This isn't among the options.
Try $a=1, b=2$. If we choose $a=1, b=89, c=90$, we get the smallest sum to be $1+90=91$.
Try $a=2, b=3$. $c = 180 - 5 = 175$. Sum = $2+175 = 177$.
Let $x, x+1, x+2$ be close to $180/3=60$. Then $3x+3=180$, $3x = 177$, $x=59$. Then angles are $59, 60, 61$. So $59+60+61=180$. The smallest is 59, the largest is 61. Then the sum is $59+61=120$.

Reasoning:
We are looking for a triangle where all angles are integers and different. We want to minimize the sum of the smallest and largest angles. Let the angles be $a, b, c$ with $a < b < c$. We have $a + b + c = 180$ and we want to minimize $a + c$.
Consider $a = 1, b = 2, \implies c = 177$, so $a + c = 178$.
Consider $a = 1, b = 89, \implies c = 90$, so $a + c = 91$.
Consider $a = 2, b = 3, \implies c = 175$, so $a + c = 177$.
Let's try to find values around 60: $59, 60, 61$. $59 + 60 + 61 = 180$. $59 + 61 = 120$.
So, let $a = 50$, $b = 60$, $c = 70$, $a+b+c=180$, so $a+c = 120$.
Let a, b, c be consecutive integers. $x-1, x, x+1$.
So the integers $59, 60, 61$ are a solution, with angles being different integers, and their sum equal to 180.
The smallest value is 59 and the largest is 61, so the sum is 120.
However, if we choose the angles to be 1, 2, and 177, their sum is 180. In that case, the smallest is 1 and largest is 177, and the total is 178. We need distinct integers.
Consider the triangle $1^\circ, 2^\circ, 177^\circ$, the sum of the smallest and largest angles is $1 + 177 = 178$.

Let the angles be 1, 2, and 177. This is distinct angles, and $1+2+177 = 180$. We want to minimize $a+c$, which is $1+177=178$. But this is not among the options.
Try $1, 60, 119 = 180$. $1+119=120$.

Reasoning:
Let the angles be a, b, c where a < b < c. We want to minimize a+c, such that a+b+c = 180.
To minimize the sum, we want the angles to be close to each other. The closest we can get is 59, 60, 61, which sums up to 180.
Therefore, the smallest angle is 59 and the largest angle is 61, their sum is 120.
Let's try smaller integers, so that the other angles have to become larger to equal to 180.

Reasoning:
We are looking for three distinct integer angles, $a, b, c$ such that $a < b < c$ and $a + b + c = 180$. We want to minimize $a + c$.
If we consider $a=1$, the smallest possible value for an angle, then $b+c = 179$. Since $1 < b < c$, the smallest value $b$ can take is $2$. Thus, $c = 179-2 = 177$. Then $a+c = 1+177 = 178$.
Next smallest we can have is $b=3$, $c = 176$. $a+c = 177$.
We can minimize the sum by making the numbers close together. Thus 59+60+61. Sum is 180.
Smallest is 59. Largest is 61. Then, their sum is 120.

Reasoning:
Let a, b, c be the three angles of the triangle, where a < b < c. We are looking for the smallest value of a+c. Since the angles must be integers and different, the sum is 180.
Let us assume the minimum possible value is 1. Then b+c = 179. In order for b and c to be integers and different, and b < c, the lowest b could be is 2, c=177. In this case, a+c = 178.
We need to search the options for the smallest, which is 61. Let's say a+c = 61. If a = 1, then c = 60. We need a,b,c all be distinct and < 60. b = 180-61 = 119. Not good.
How about 120? To get angles that are close to each other, try to divide by 3. Let's consider angles around 60. 59,60,61 = 180. Since they all have to be distinct, smallest plus largest is 120. This gives the sum of angles be 59+60+61=180.
