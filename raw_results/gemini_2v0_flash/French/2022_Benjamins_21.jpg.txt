Reasoning: The given figure consists of 9 cubes arranged in a particular shape. We need to find an alternative view of the same assemblage from the given options.
Looking at the original figure, we can observe:
- A vertical section consisting of 4 cubes.
- A horizontal section attached to the top of the vertical section consisting of 5 cubes.
- The horizontal section forms a kind of 'T' shape.

If we look at option A, we can't construct a similar 'T' arrangement using 5 cubes.
If we look at option B, we can't construct a similar 'T' arrangement using 5 cubes.
If we look at option C, it has the right shape.
If we look at option D, the bottom section would have 5, and the top would have 4, not corresponding to the given figure.
If we look at option E, the 'T' shape is upside down compared to the original one.

Reasoning that the answer is an alternative *view* leads to realizing that viewing C from the bottom shows the original figure, and the other answers don't permit it.

Answer: C)
