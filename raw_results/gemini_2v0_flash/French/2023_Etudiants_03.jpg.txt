Reasoning: Let $x$ be the number of times Julie obtains a 6. Then the total points are $6x + a + b + c + d$, where $a, b, c, d$ are the scores of the remaining $5-x$ throws. We are given that $6x + a + b + c + d = 19$. We want to find the maximum possible value for $x$.
Since $a, b, c, d$ are the scores of the dice, they must be integers between 1 and 6. Thus, the smallest possible value for $a, b, c, d$ is 1.
If $x=0$, then $a+b+c+d+e=19$, where $1 \le a,b,c,d,e \le 6$. Possible.
If $x=1$, then $6 + a + b + c + d = 19$, so $a + b + c + d = 13$. $a,b,c,d$ must be at least 1 and at most 6. $1+1+1+1 = 4$ and $6+6+6+6 = 24$. So $1 \le a,b,c,d \le 6$ and $a+b+c+d=13$. This is possible.
If $x=2$, then $6(2) + a + b + c = 19$, so $12 + a + b + c = 19$, which means $a + b + c = 7$. Since $a,b,c$ must be at least 1, $a+b+c = 1+1+5$ or $1+2+4$ or $1+3+3$ or $2+2+3$. So it's possible.
If $x=3$, then $6(3) + a + b = 19$, so $18 + a + b = 19$, which means $a + b = 1$. However, $a$ and $b$ must be at least 1, so $a+b \ge 2$. This is not possible. Therefore, the maximum value of $x$ is 2.

With $x=3$, we have three 6's, and two other values, $a,b$.
$6+6+6+a+b=19$
$18+a+b=19$
$a+b=1$
Since $1 \le a,b \le 6$, this is impossible. The smallest possible value for $a+b$ is 2.

With $x=2$, we have two 6's, and three other values, $a,b,c$.
$6+6+a+b+c=19$
$12+a+b+c=19$
$a+b+c=7$
Possible, since each $a,b,c$ can be at least 1. $a=1, b=1, c=5$ is a solution.

The largest integer number of 6's Julie can have is 2. If she had 3, the other two numbers would need to sum to 1, which is not possible since the minimum is 1. So 2 sixes, plus three other numbers is $12 + a+b+c = 19$, $a+b+c=7$. This is easily possible since the lowest value is 1.

Reasoning: We are given that the total is 19 and each die roll is between 1 and 6. We want to maximize the number of 6's rolled. Let $n$ be the number of 6's rolled. Then $19 = 6n + x_1 + \dots + x_{5-n}$, where $1 \le x_i \le 6$.
If $n=3$, then $19 = 18 + x_1 + x_2$. Then $x_1 + x_2 = 1$, which is impossible since $x_i \ge 1$.
If $n=2$, then $19 = 12 + x_1 + x_2 + x_3$. Then $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 7$. We can have $x_1=1, x_2=1, x_3=5$, which are all valid. So 2 is possible.
If $n=1$, then $19 = 6 + x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4$. Then $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 13$. We can have $x_1=1, x_2=3, x_3=4, x_4=5$, which are all valid. So 1 is possible.
If $n=0$, then $19 = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5$. We can have $x_1=2, x_2=3, x_3=4, x_4=5, x_5=5$, which are all valid. So 0 is possible.
The maximum is thus 2.
