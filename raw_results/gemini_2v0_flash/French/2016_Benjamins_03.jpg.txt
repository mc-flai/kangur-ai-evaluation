Reasoning: The question asks how many magnets can be removed without any of the postcards falling. Looking at the image, it shows the postcards attached to the refrigerator with magnets (indicated by the black circles). The postcard with three magnets is supported by 3 magnets. The other postcards are supported by one magnet each.
We can remove any of the single magnets as long as we keep one magnet on each card.
There is a group of 7 magnets in total. One card has 3 magnets; the remaining 4 cards each have one magnet. We can remove one of the 3 magnets on the card held by 3 magnets. That leaves two magnets supporting that card. We can then remove the 4 single magnets that support the 4 cards.
The maximum number of magnets that can be removed is 1 (from the group of 3) + 4 (single magnets) = 5.
