Reasoning: The container has a square base with side 10 cm. The volume of the water is 10 * 10 * h = 100h cm³. When the cube is plunged into the water, the water level rises. The cube has a side of 2 cm, so its volume is 2³ = 8 cm³. This volume of 8 cm³ corresponds to the increase in the water level. Let the height of this increase be x.
Since the base of the container is 10 cm x 10 cm, the volume of the water that corresponds to the increase is 10 * 10 * x = 100x cm³.
Therefore, 100x = 8, which means x = 8/100 = 0.08 cm.
The minimum value of h for the cube to be completely immersed without exceeding the water level is such that h + x = 2 (since the height of the cube is 2 cm).
h + 0.08 = 2
h = 2 - 0.08 = 1.92 cm.

Answer: B)
