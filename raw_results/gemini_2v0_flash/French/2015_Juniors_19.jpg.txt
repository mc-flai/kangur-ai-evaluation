Reasoning:
Let's analyze the statements of the students. Let's consider two scenarios: one where Luc is telling the truth, and another where Luc is lying.

Scenario 1: Luc is telling the truth (1 student was at the school). Then four students are lying.
- Luc says: 1
- Marc says: 0
- Nina says: 2
- Olga says: 3
- Prune says: 4

If Luc is telling the truth, then Marc, Nina, Olga, and Prune are lying. This would mean that 4 students were not at the school yesterday. The students who were not at the school are the ones who lied. So this checks out.

Scenario 2: Luc is lying. Then only Luc is telling the truth. Then 1 student was not at school. Therefore, it's impossible for Luc to lie here as it states that those who do not tell the truth are those who were not at school.

Only the first scenario works. Thus, there are 4 students who were not at the school.
