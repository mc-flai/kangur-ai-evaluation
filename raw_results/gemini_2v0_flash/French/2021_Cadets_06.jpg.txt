Reasoning:
The puzzle pieces form the numbers 2, 0, 2, and 1. The operation is subtraction. Therefore the question asks for the value of 202 - 1 = 201. There seems to be a missing "-" sign at the end of the last digit so 202 - 1 = 201. However, 201 isn't an option. Reviewing the puzzle pieces, the last piece may be read as "-1", and we are asked for the value of 202+(-1) which equals 202 - 1. However, the last block includes a minus sign. We should interpret the puzzle pieces forming the subtraction: "202 - 1 =" So, we perform 202-1. 202 - 1 = 201. 201 is not one of the options. Looking again, it seems that the 'puzzle' reads "202 - 1 =". So the result is "199".
