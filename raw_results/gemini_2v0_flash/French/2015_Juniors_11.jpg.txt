Reasoning:
The problem asks for the shortest distance from the starting point "Départ" to the ending point "Arrivée" moving along sides or diagonals of the 8 squares, where each square has side length 1. The horizontal distance is 3 and the vertical distance is 2.
We could move along the sides. In this case, the distance is 3 + 2 = 5. However, using diagonals may be shorter.
We need to move 3 units horizontally and 2 units vertically.
If we take the direct horizontal route, then vertically, one can move down by taking the square root of 2 diagonally twice so: 3+ 2*(sqrt(2)) which is not in any of the choices.
Let's try to move as diagonally as possible. We can make two diagonal movements directly across the 2x3 rectangle.
The horizontal distance to move will be 3 and the vertical distance to move is 2. The diagonal has a length of sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). Using two diagonals will be 2sqrt(2). Then the path will still have 2 horizontal sides of length 1 each. So total will be 2 + 2sqrt(2).
Let's consider using 4 diagonals (i.e., cutting across each square individually). 4*sqrt(2) = 4sqrt(2), which is choice D.
Let's consider horizontal movement and then movement down diagonally. The horizontal can be covered by moving straight with 3. And two diagonals can get down. In that case it becomes 3 + 2*sqrt(2). This is not an option.
Let's consider vertical movement and then movement to the right diagonally. The vertical can be covered by moving straight with 2. And three diagonals to the right has distance 3*sqrt(2), so then the path is 2+3sqrt(2).
We can move right 2 steps, then down and right diagonally, then down and right diagonally. Thus the path is 2 * 1 + 2 * sqrt(2) = 2 + 2sqrt(2). This corresponds to C).
