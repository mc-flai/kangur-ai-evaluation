Reasoning:
The puzzle is made up of seven pieces with triangles of three sizes: small, medium, and large.
If we look at the square formed by the two small triangles in the upper left corner of the overall square, we can observe the following sizes of triangles:
Two small triangles make a medium-sized triangle. Two medium-sized triangles would form a large-sized triangle. Also, two small triangles can make a small square.

Now consider the largest triangle in the square; it is composed of four small triangles. The medium triangle is composed of two small triangles. Therefore, the total area of the square corresponds to the combination of the areas of 2 small triangles (medium sized) + 4 small triangles (large-sized) + 2 small triangles (2 small triangles) + 2 small triangles (forming a square) + 4 small triangles (large triangle).

Then total area of the square can be expressed as:
2+4+2+2+4= 16 small triangles.

Answer: C)
