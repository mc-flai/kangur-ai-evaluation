Reasoning: The kangaroo in the first triangle is facing to the right. After reflecting it across the first dotted line, it is facing to the left. Reflecting across the second dotted line makes it face to the right again. Therefore, at the triangle with the black dot, the kangaroo is facing right. Also, the kangaroo's head is pointing towards the tip of the triangle. Options A, B, and C point in other directions. Thus, only options D or E are left, but only D points to the left.
Answer: D)
