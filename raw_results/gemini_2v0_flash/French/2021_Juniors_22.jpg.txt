Reasoning:
Let's denote the colors as V, R, J, B. We know that every 5 consecutive tokens contain exactly one R, one J, and one B. Also, the token after a red one is always yellow. The tokens 2, 20, and 202 are green.

Let's look at the pattern modulo 5. Let's assume token 1 is some color X.
Token 2 is V.
Then tokens 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 contain R, J, B, V and X.
The position of R, J, and B are constrained within these 5. Also R must be followed by J.

The tokens are numbered 1 to 2021.
Token 2 is V, token 20 is V, and token 202 is V.
We can deduce that 202 - 20 = 182 and 202 - 2 = 200.
Since 202 = 2 + 200, and 20 is green, and 202 is green, the distance must be a multiple of something that can repeat. Let the repeating length be 'x'. Then
x must divide 182 = 2 * 7 * 13
x must divide 200 = 2^3 * 5^2
The common divisors of 182 and 200 are 1 and 2. Since we have 4 colors, and every 5 consecutive tokens contain 1 R, 1 J, 1 B, the repeating unit cannot be 2, it has to be bigger than 2.
Let's assume there is a pattern which has length of something.
However, since every 5 consecutive tokens contain exactly one of each color R, J, and B, the repeating unit must be 4 or more.
Let n be the repeating unit of length. Token n+2 is V. Token 2n+2 is V.
In general, k*n + 2 is V, where k is integer.
We are interested in 2021, so 2021 = kn + 2 for some integer k. Then kn = 2019.
Factors of 2019 = 3 * 673. So n can be 3 or 673. If n=3, then the sequence is V V V, which violates the condition that every 5 tokens contains R, J, and B.
The length of 5 consecutive is not enough to form the repeating pattern.

Consider a sequence: V R J B.
Since the token after R is always J, we have a sequence like V R J. It repeats.

However, we know that every consecutive 5 tokens will have exactly one red, one yellow and one blue.

2021 = 5 * 404 + 1.
Let's consider a sequence of length 5: G R J B X
If X is green, then this works.
G R J B G
Then the 6th one must be green. 2+5k are all green. 20= 2+ 5*3.6; so 20 is not 2 mod 5. 20 is 0 mod 5. 202 = 2 + 5k; 200 = 5k; 40=k;
Thus token 2 is green, token 20 is green, and token 202 is green.

Let the sequence be V x y z. We need R J B.
The repeating unit must be 4 or 5.
So the colors will be V, R, J, B and the sequence is periodic of length 4.

2021 = 4*505 + 1
Since 2 is V, 6 is V, and so on, any number of the form 4n+2 is V.
2021 = 4(504) + 5 = 4(504)+4+1 = 4(505)+1
Thus, 2021 is V, since 2021 is in the form 4n+1, just before the V.

Reasoning:
The key is to use the given fact that tokens 2, 20, and 202 are green.  This strongly suggests a repeating pattern, since 20-2 = 18 and 202-20 = 182 are both multiples of a potential pattern length.  The requirement of R,J, and B within any 5 tokens is a constraint. 2021 is the 2020th number to calculate.

We know token 2 is Green.
2021-2 = 2019

Reasoning: Let's consider a cycle of 4 V, R, J, B
If token 2 is V then token 1 is either R, J, or B. We need R to be followed by J.

Let us say V R J B V R J B V R J B..
Token 1 is V. Token 2 is V.
Token 20 is V.
Token 202 is V.

2021 divided by 4 is 505 with a remainder of 1. So the 2021st is color 1 which is V.

Reasoning:
Since 2, 20, 202 are green, it suggests periodicity. Let period be n. Then 2+kn is green. 2021 = 2 + k n for some k. Also, 2021-1 is the 2020.
Let's consider x consecutive tokens. The number of Red, yellow, and blue is 1 respectively. So, among 5 consecutive tokens there is 1 red, 1 yellow and 1 blue. Token that follows red is always yellow. Therefore, token 2021 will be either green, red, yellow or blue. We can find repeating sequence.

The differences between 2, 20, and 202 are 18 and 182 respectively. The repeating pattern has to be a factor of 18 and 182. Then, 2021 is color 1, thus green

Reasoning: Given that every 5 consecutive coins, have one Red, Yellow, Blue.

If coin 1 is V, 2 is V, 20 is V, 202 is V
The length of repetition must be 4. If token 2 is V, 20 is V, 202 is V, it will be the nth. Therefore,

Token 2021's color can be calculated based on the periodicity of the length 4.
2021 Mod 4 = 1. Therefore token 2021 will be Green.
1) V, 2) Green.
2021 is congruent to 1 Mod 4
