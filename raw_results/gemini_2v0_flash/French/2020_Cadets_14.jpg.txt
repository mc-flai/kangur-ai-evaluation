Reasoning: Let $x$ be the total number of students in the class.
$\frac{3}{5}x$ students swim and $\frac{3}{5}x$ students dance.
5 students swim and dance.
Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:
Total = Swimmers + Dancers - Both
$x = \frac{3}{5}x + \frac{3}{5}x - 5$
$x = \frac{6}{5}x - 5$
$5 = \frac{6}{5}x - x$
$5 = \frac{1}{5}x$
$x = 5 \times 5$
$x = 25$
Therefore, the total number of students in the class is 25.
