Reasoning:
Let $R$ be the number of red rectangles, $B$ be the number of blue rectangles, $CR$ be the number of red squares, and $CB$ be the number of blue squares.
We are given that the total number of squares is 7, so $CR + CB = 7$.
We are also given that there are three more red rectangles than blue squares, so $R = CB + 3$.
And there are two more red squares than blue rectangles, so $CR = B + 2$.
We want to find the number of blue rectangles, $B$.

Since all rectangles are either red or blue, we have $R + B =$ total number of rectangles.
Substituting $R = CB + 3$ and $CR = B + 2$ into $CR + CB = 7$, we can write $CB = 7 - CR = 7 - (B+2) = 5 - B$.
Then, $R = CB + 3 = (5 - B) + 3 = 8 - B$.
Thus, $R + B = (8 - B) + B = 8$. So there are a total of 8 rectangles.
Now we have $R + B = 8$, $R = CB + 3$, and $CR = B + 2$, and $CR+CB = 7$.
We want to find the number of blue rectangles $B$.
$CB = 7 - CR = 7 - (B+2) = 5 - B$.
$R = CB + 3 = 5 - B + 3 = 8 - B$.
Since $R+B = 8$, we have $8 - B + B = 8$, which is always true.
So, we need more information to determine $B$.

$CR = B + 2 \implies CR = B + 2$. Also, $CB = 5 - B$.
Since $CR$ and $CB$ are non-negative, $B + 2 \geq 0$ and $5 - B \geq 0$.
So, $B \geq -2$ and $B \leq 5$. Since $B$ must be a non-negative integer, $0 \leq B \leq 5$.

We can test the possible values for B:
- If $B = 1$, then $CR = 3$, $CB = 4$, and $R = 7$. So $R+B = 7 + 1 = 8$.
- If $B = 3$, then $CR = 5$, $CB = 2$, and $R = 5$. So $R+B = 5 + 3 = 8$.
- If $B = 5$, then $CR = 7$, $CB = 0$, and $R = 3$. So $R+B = 3 + 5 = 8$.

We know that R = CB + 3. If B=1, then CR = 3 and CB = 4. R= CB + 3=4+3=7. Then R + B = 7+1=8.
If B=3, then CR = 5 and CB = 2. R = CB + 3=2+3=5. Then R + B = 5+3=8.
If B=5, then CR = 7 and CB = 0. R = CB + 3=0+3=3. Then R + B = 3+5=8.

Only B=5 is a possible answer from the choices given.

Reasoning: We set up a system of equations based on the given information. We expressed the number of red rectangles in terms of the number of blue rectangles. Then used the equations to solve for the unknowns, and tested the possible values of B.
