Reasoning:
The problem states that Jules' salary is 20% of his boss's salary. We need to find out how many times Jules' salary is the boss's salary.
Let J be Jules' salary and B be the boss's salary. We have:
J = 0.20 * B
We want to find B in terms of J.
Dividing both sides by 0.20, we get:
B = J / 0.20
B = J / (20/100)
B = J * (100/20)
B = J * 5
So, the boss's salary is 5 times Jules' salary.
