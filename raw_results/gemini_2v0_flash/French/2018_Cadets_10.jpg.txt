Reasoning:
The problem states that a rectangle is divided into rows of small squares. There are 40 identical small squares in total. Andre finds the middle row and colors the squares in that row. We need to find how many squares are not colored.

The number of rows must be a factor of 40. Also, since it talks about the middle row, the number of rows could be odd or even.
Consider the possible number of rows:
1 row: The middle row has 40 squares, so 40 are colored, 40-40 = 0 left.
2 rows: 20 squares in each row, Andre colored 20 squares, leaving 40-20 = 20 left.
4 rows: 10 squares in each row, Andre colored 10 squares, leaving 40-10 = 30 left.
5 rows: 8 squares in each row, Andre colored 8 squares, leaving 40-8 = 32 left.
8 rows: 5 squares in each row, Andre colored 5 squares, leaving 40-5 = 35 left.
10 rows: 4 squares in each row, Andre colored 4 squares, leaving 40-4 = 36 left.
20 rows: 2 squares in each row, Andre colored 2 squares, leaving 40-2 = 38 left.
40 rows: 1 square in each row, Andre colored 1 square, leaving 40-1 = 39 left.

Based on the possible answers, there are two options: B) 30, C) 32, D) 35, E) 39.
If there are 4 rows, then there are 10 squares in the row. When we color the squares in the middle row, we are left with 30 uncolored squares.
If there are 5 rows, then there are 8 squares in the row. When we color the squares in the middle row, we are left with 32 uncolored squares.
If there are 8 rows, then there are 5 squares in the row. When we color the squares in the middle row, we are left with 35 uncolored squares.
If there are 40 rows, then there is 1 square in the row. When we color the squares in the middle row, we are left with 39 uncolored squares.

Therefore, the options can be 30, 32, 35, or 39.

Answer: B)
There appears to be an issue. Let me analyze better and refine the answer.
If the middle row is colored, then we remove squares. We need to find values among the options.
If the rows are arranged in a 4x10 configuration. There are 4 rows and 10 columns. Then the middle rows would actually be two rows, at rows 2 and 3. That's 2*10=20. We are left with 40-10 =30. So 4 rows and 10 columns. The middle row has 10 and 40-10=30.
If we have 5 rows and 8 columns, 5x8 configuration, the middle is row 3. Then we have 8 squares and 40-8=32.
If we have 8 rows and 5 columns, 8x5 configuration. The middle is between row 4 and 5 (if even). If we are saying that there are two middle rows (between 4 and 5), then it wouldn't be a middle row. We can take the average row, so the number colored will be 5. 40-5=35.
If we have 40 rows and 1 columns, 40x1 configuration, the middle is between 20 and 21 (if even). Since we are taking only one middle row, it will be row 20 (rounding down) or 21 (rounding up). The middle row has 1 and 40-1=39.

Answer: B), C), D), or E).
If there are 4 rows and 10 squares in each row. Andre selects a middle row which will be 10 squares. So 40-10=30 squares remaining
Reasoning: Let's reconsider the prompt. It says "Andre finds *the* middle row". This indicates there is a single middle row. This implies that the number of rows is odd. Let the number of rows be r. Then 40/r = an integer k, the number of squares in each row. r must divide 40 and be odd. Possible values for r are 1, 5. If r = 1, there is only 1 row of 40 squares. Then he colors it all, leaving 0 uncolored. If r = 5, then there are 8 squares in each row. Then 5*8 = 40. The middle row is row 3. He colors 8 squares, leaving 40 - 8 = 32 squares. Since we must pick from the given options, and 32 is given, this must be it.
Answer: C)
