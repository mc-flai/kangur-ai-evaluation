Reasoning:
Let's analyze the possible arrangements of the villages V, L, G, and S on the line. We know VG = 75, LS = 45, and LG = 20.
Case 1: L is between V and G. Then VG = VL + LG, so 75 = VL + 20, which means VL = 55. Also, LS = 45.
Subcase 1a: S is between L and V. Then VL = VS + LS, so 55 = VS + 45, which means VS = 10.
Subcase 1b: L is between V and S. Then VS = VL + LS, so VS = 55 + 45 = 100.
Subcase 1c: V is between L and S. Then LS = LV + VS, so 45 = 55 + VS, which means VS = -10, impossible since distances are non-negative.

Case 2: G is between V and L. Then VL = VG + GL, so VL = 75 + 20 = 95. Also, LS = 45.
Subcase 2a: L is between V and S. Then VS = VL + LS, so VS = 95 + 45 = 140.
Subcase 2b: S is between V and L. Then VL = VS + SL, so 95 = VS + 45, which means VS = 50.
Subcase 2c: V is between L and S. Then LS = LV + VS, so 45 = 95 + VS, which means VS = -50, impossible.

Case 3: V is between L and G. Then LG = LV + VG, so 20 = LV + 75, which means LV = -55, impossible.
So possible values for VS are 10, 100, 140, 50.
The distance that isn't surely the distance between V and S is 80 km.
