Reasoning:
The total amount paid for the cakes is 80 + 50 + 20 = 150 centimes.
The question asks how many cakes Anne would have received if the 30 cakes were divided proportionally to the amount each sister paid.  Anne paid 80 centimes, which is 80/150 of the total cost.
Therefore, Anne would have received (80/150) * 30 cakes = (80/5) * 1 cakes = 16 cakes.
