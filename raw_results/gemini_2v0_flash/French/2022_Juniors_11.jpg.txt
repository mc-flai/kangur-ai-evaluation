Reasoning:
The question asks for the area of the shaded region. We have four circles of radius 1, and three larger circles. Let the radius of the larger circles be $R$. Since the centers are aligned, we can see that $2R = 4 \cdot 1$, hence $R=2$. The shaded area consists of two segments in the larger circles. The angle of each segment is $\pi/3$ (60 degrees), and area of segment equals area of sector minus the area of triangle. Area of larger circle equals $A = \pi R^2 = 4\pi$. Each larger circle has an area of $\pi \cdot (2)^2 = 4\pi$. Thus, the shaded region is two circle segments of the larger circles. The sector area is $60^{\circ} / 360^{\circ}$ times the area of a circle with radius 2, which is $(1/6) \cdot 4\pi = (2/3) \cdot 2\pi$. To get the segment we subtract area of triangle with base $2$ and side lengths of $2$. The height is $\sqrt{3}$. The triangle area is $\sqrt{3}$. Then area of segment = $2\pi/3 - \sqrt{3}$. So 2 segments is $4\pi/3 - 2\sqrt{3}$. However the four small circles of radius $1$ have $\pi 1^2 = \pi$. There are 2 half circles that make up the shaded regions between the larger circles and smaller circles. Then it is simply the area of 2 half circles of radius 1. Area = $\pi$.

However, the easier way is to notice that each of the two shaded area is equal to the half of a circle with radius $2$, minus a circle with radius $1$. So the entire area is $2 (0.5 \pi 2^2 - \pi 1^2) = 2(2\pi - \pi) = 2 \pi$.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Each shaded region is half a circle with radius 2, with the circle of radius 1 removed. Thus it is half of 4pi - pi = pi. There are two such regions and the total area is then pi + pi = 2 pi.

Answer: B)
Reasoning: The radius of the bigger circles is 2. Two semi-circles is the shaded area. Total area is $2\pi$.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The big circles have radius 2. The small circles have radius 1. There are two shaded segments. Each shaded segment can be found by taking a semi-circle of radius 2 and removing a full circle of radius 1 from it.
The semi-circle has area (1/2) * pi * 2^2 = 2pi.
The circle has area pi * 1^2 = pi.
So the area of one shaded region is 2pi - pi = pi.
Since there are two, the total area is pi + pi = 2pi.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Each shaded region consists of half of a big circle with radius 2, minus one small circle with radius 1. Thus the area of each shaded region is 1/2*pi*(2^2) - pi*(1^2) = 2pi - pi = pi. There are two such regions. Therefore the total shaded area is pi+pi = 2pi.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let R be the radius of the larger circles and r the radius of the smaller circles. Then R=2 and r=1. The shaded region is composed of two identical "lens" shapes. The area of each "lens" shape is equal to the area of the semi-circle of the larger circle minus the area of the entire smaller circle. Therefore the area of one "lens" is (1/2) * pi * 2^2 - pi * 1^2 = 2pi - pi = pi. Since we have two "lenses" the total shaded area is pi+pi = 2pi.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The radius of the bigger circles is 2, so the semi-circle made by each of them has area 1/2 * pi * 2^2 = 2pi. Then we need to remove a small circle, which has radius 1, so its area is pi * 1^2 = pi. So the shaded area of each half is 2pi - pi = pi. We have two, so the answer is 2pi

Answer: B)
Reasoning: Each shaded region is a semi-circle of radius 2, minus a full circle of radius 1. Thus the area is (1/2) * pi * (2^2) - pi * (1^2) = 2pi - pi = pi. Since there are two such shaded regions, the total area is 2pi.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:

The two larger circles have a radius of 2. The smaller circles have a radius of 1. We are looking for the total shaded area. This is comprised of the two shapes on each end. Each shape is comprised of 1/2 the larger circle area with radius 2, minus the area of 1 smaller circle area with radius 1. This gives us 1/2(pi * 2^2) - (pi * 1^2) = 1/2 * 4pi - pi = 2pi - pi = pi. Since there are two of these shaded areas, the final total is 2 * pi = 2pi.

Answer: B)
Reasoning: The radius of the larger circles is 2. The area of the semi-circle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \pi (2^2) = 2\pi$. The radius of the smaller circles is 1. The area of the circle is $\pi(1^2) = \pi$. Each shaded area is the difference, which is $2\pi - \pi = \pi$. There are two such areas, so the total is $2\pi$.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Each of the shaded areas are formed by taking the semi-circle formed by the large circles with radius 2 and removing one small circle from the area with radius 1. This amounts to finding:

$$ 2 \cdot (\frac{1}{2} \cdot \pi r_{large}^{2} - \pi r_{small}^{2}) = 2 \cdot (\frac{1}{2} \cdot \pi 2^{2} - \pi 1^{2}) = 2 \cdot (2\pi - \pi) = 2 \cdot \pi = 2\pi$$

Answer: B)
