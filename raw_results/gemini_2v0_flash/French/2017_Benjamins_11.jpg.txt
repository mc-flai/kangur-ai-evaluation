Reasoning: The problem states that the 3-seater sofa is 220cm wide, and the 2-seater is 160cm wide. They are composed of the same armrests and cushions. Let's assume the width of one seat (cushion) is x, and the width of the two armrests combined is y.
Then we have:
3x + y = 220
2x + y = 160
Subtracting the second equation from the first gives:
x = 60
Substituting x = 60 into the second equation gives:
2(60) + y = 160
120 + y = 160
y = 40
The armchair has 1 seat and the same two armrests, so its width is x + y = 60 + 40 = 100 cm.
