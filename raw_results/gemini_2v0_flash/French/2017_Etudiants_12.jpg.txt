Reasoning:
Let $S$ be the number of squares and $T$ be the number of triangles. We are given that $S=6$. We are also given that each square is surrounded by 4 triangles, and each triangle is surrounded by 3 squares.
The number of pairs (square, triangle) can be calculated in two ways:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Since each square is surrounded by 4 triangles, the number of (square, triangle) pairs is $4 \times S$.
    \item Since each triangle is surrounded by 3 squares, the number of (square, triangle) pairs is $3 \times T$.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, we have the equation $4S = 3T$.
We are given that $S=6$, so we can substitute this value into the equation:
$4(6) = 3T$
$24 = 3T$
$T = \frac{24}{3} = 8$
So there are 8 triangles.
