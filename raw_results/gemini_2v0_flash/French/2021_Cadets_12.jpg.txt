Let $P$ be the weight of the empty pot, and $C$ be the capacity of the pot.
When the pot is filled to one-fifth of its capacity, the weight is 560g. This can be written as:
$P + \frac{1}{5} \times (\text{weight of water when filled}) = 560$
When the pot is filled to four-fifths of its capacity, the weight is 740g. This can be written as:
$P + \frac{4}{5} \times (\text{weight of water when filled}) = 740$

Let $W$ be the weight of the water when the pot is completely filled. Then the equations are:
$P + \frac{1}{5}W = 560$ (1)
$P + \frac{4}{5}W = 740$ (2)

Subtract (1) from (2):
$(P + \frac{4}{5}W) - (P + \frac{1}{5}W) = 740 - 560$
$\frac{3}{5}W = 180$
$W = \frac{5}{3} \times 180 = 5 \times 60 = 300$

Substitute $W = 300$ into (1):
$P + \frac{1}{5}(300) = 560$
$P + 60 = 560$
$P = 560 - 60 = 500$

Therefore, the weight of the empty pot is 500g.

Reasoning: I set up a system of equations to represent the given information. I defined variables for the weight of the empty pot and the weight of the water when the pot is full. Then I solved for the weight of the empty pot.
