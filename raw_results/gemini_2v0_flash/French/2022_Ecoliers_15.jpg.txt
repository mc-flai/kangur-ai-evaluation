Reasoning:
The question says that the carpet is square, so all sides have the same number of points. The points are arranged in two rows along each side. The visible side in the image shows 6 dots along its edge. So, there are 6 dots on each side. Thus, each side has 2 rows of 3 dots. In total we have four sides that are 2 rows of 3 dots each. The total number of dots on the carpet is 4 sides * 6 dots = 24 dots. However, each corner dot is part of two sides, so we have counted the corners twice. Since there are four corners, we counted them twice; the amount of corner points is subtracted from the multiplication.
Instead, each side has 3 dots per row, and two rows. Each side thus has 6 points.
A square has 4 sides, thus we have a total of 4 sides * 6 points = 24 points, PLUS those on other side not visible, which is 24. The total is equal to 48. However, we are overcounting the corner points because they are common to each side, so we need to deduct those. There are four corners, and thus, we have the total equals 6+6+6+6+6+6+6+6 = 48 points.
Each side contains a row of 6 points with 4 sides; 6*4 sides = 24.
We also see that the corners are being counted twice. Therefore 4 sides of each of 3 dots (each row) has 12 dots each, summing 4 * 2 * 3 = 24 total dots. However, this carpet has four corners with the dots that should not be recounted. In the picture the carpet is folding. It appears that each side of the square carpet has 2 rows of 3 dots. Each row is 3 dots. Thus, we have a row of 3 dots. So we add the number of all four sides = 4+4+4+4 = 16. Then, there are 2 rows = 16 + 16 = 32 dots. But each side is supposed to have the same dots.
Let's try each side has a 2x3 pattern to the border. So, there are 6 points per side. If the mat had those points, then the total is 6*4 = 24+ corner points (8 corner points that is doubled).
Let's calculate the sides, where we are folding it to see how many are being hidden. We only see one quarter.
In the picture we only see 12 dots. We are expecting 48 dots in all.

Let's start by counting the dots that we see.
We count 12 dots. Each side is identical to the other.
If we unfold that image, then we have the total dots.
Two rows and three columns is 6 points on each side.
There is a mat of folding in it. When folded is has only 12 points visible.
Because the sides have some corners, we must exclude those for one side. The correct answer should be 32 based on the fact that the points are aligned on two rows.

Reasoning:
The image depicts a folded square carpet. One side is visible and shows 6 dots, which are arranged in 2 rows of 3 dots each. Since it's a square, all sides have the same number of dots. Therefore, each side has 6 dots. A square has 4 sides, so the total number of dots is 4 * 6. Plus the additional rows that are folded is equal 32. So, each side has 8 points. This calculation excludes the overcounted dots in the corners.
