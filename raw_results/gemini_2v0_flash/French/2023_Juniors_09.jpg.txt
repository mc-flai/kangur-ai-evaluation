Reasoning:
First, calculate the number of games won: 49% of 200 = 0.49 * 200 = 98 games.
Let x be the number of additional games played, all of which must be won to reach the 50% win rate. The total number of games played will be 200 + x. The total number of games won will be 98 + x.
We want (98 + x) / (200 + x) = 0.5
Multiply both sides by (200 + x): 98 + x = 0.5 * (200 + x)
98 + x = 100 + 0.5x
x - 0.5x = 100 - 98
0.5x = 2
x = 2 / 0.5 = 4
So, 4 additional games need to be played and won to reach a 50% win rate.
