Reasoning: Let T, J, and L represent the ages of Tom, Jean, and Léo, respectively. We are given the following equations:
1. T + J = 23
2. J + L = 24
3. T + L = 25

Adding all three equations together, we get:
2T + 2J + 2L = 23 + 24 + 25 = 72
Dividing by 2, we get:
T + J + L = 36

Now we can find the individual ages by subtracting each of the original equations from this total:
L = (T + J + L) - (T + J) = 36 - 23 = 13
T = (T + J + L) - (J + L) = 36 - 24 = 12
J = (T + J + L) - (T + L) = 36 - 25 = 11

Thus, Léo is 13, Tom is 12, and Jean is 11. Therefore, Léo is the oldest.
