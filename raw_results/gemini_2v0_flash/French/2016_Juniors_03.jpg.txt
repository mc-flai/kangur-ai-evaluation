Reasoning:
Let $J$ be the number of correct answers and $F$ be the number of incorrect answers.
We know that the total number of questions is 60, so $J + F = 60$.
Also, the number of correct answers is twice the number of incorrect answers, so $J = 2F$.
We can substitute $J = 2F$ into the first equation: $2F + F = 60$, which means $3F = 60$.
Dividing both sides by 3, we get $F = 20$.
Now we can find $J$ using the equation $J = 2F$, so $J = 2(20) = 40$.
Therefore, the number of questions answered correctly is 40.
