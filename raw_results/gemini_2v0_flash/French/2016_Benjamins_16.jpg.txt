Reasoning:
The number BENJAMIN is odd, so N can be 1, 3, 5, or 7. The number is divisible by 3, which means the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 in some order and are assigned to B, E, N, J, A, M, and I. Since the digits 1 to 7 are used, their sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28.
Let S be the sum of the digits B, E, J, A, M, and I. Then the sum of the digits of the number BENJAMIN is S + 2N, where N represents the digit represented by the letter N. This sum must be divisible by 3. Since S + N + N = 28, S = 28 - N. Therefore (28 - N) + N must be divisible by 3. So (28 + N) must be divisible by 3. Thus N can be 1, 3, 5, or 7.
Let's test the possible values of N.
- If N = 1, the sum is 28 + 1 = 29 which is not divisible by 3.
- If N = 3, the sum is 28 + 3 = 31 which is not divisible by 3.
- If N = 5, the sum is 28 + 5 = 33 which is divisible by 3.
- If N = 7, the sum is 28 + 7 = 35 which is not divisible by 3.
So the only possible value for N is 5.
