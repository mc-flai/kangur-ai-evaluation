Reasoning: The card is first rotated along its left edge. This reverses the left and right portions. Then it's rotated along its top edge, reversing the top and bottom portions.
In the original figure, the black semi-circle is on the right side.
First rotation along the left edge: the black semi-circle moves to the left side.
Second rotation along the top edge: the black semi-circle remains on the left side and it moves to the top. This matches option B.

Answer: B)
