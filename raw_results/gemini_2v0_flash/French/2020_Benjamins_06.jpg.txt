Reasoning:
Manon starts with 10 sheets of paper. After cutting some of the sheets in two, she ends up with 16 sheets. This means she has 6 more sheets than she started with. Each sheet she cuts in two adds one additional sheet (1 sheet becomes 2). Therefore, the number of sheets she cut is equal to the increase in the number of sheets, which is 16 - 10 = 6.
