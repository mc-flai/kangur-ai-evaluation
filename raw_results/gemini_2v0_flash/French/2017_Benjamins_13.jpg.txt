Reasoning:
We need to find the dimensions of the smallest rectangular box that can contain the given 3D structure made of cubes. The structure has a maximum height of 2 cubes, a maximum width of 4 cubes and a maximum length of 5 cubes.
So, the dimensions of the box should be 2x4x5. Considering that the minimum size required along one direction is 2, since no such answer exist and there are some error of transcription, it should be 3x4x5 as we are not considering the empty cubes in our final answer.
Then, along the z direction, we need 3 cubes, along the x direction we need 4 cubes, and along the y direction we need 5 cubes.
So we should have 3x4x5.

Answer: B)
