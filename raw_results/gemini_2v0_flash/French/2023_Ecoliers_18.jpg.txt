Reasoning:
The question asks for the number of different orders Hermione, Margot, and Camille can enter the class given the restrictions: Hermione is never first, Margot is never second, and Camille is never last.

Let's list the possible orders:
1. Margot, Hermione, Camille
2. Margot, Camille, Hermione
3. Camille, Hermione, Margot

Hermione cannot be first: eliminates orders like Hermione, Margot, Camille etc.
Margot cannot be second: eliminates orders like Hermione, Margot, Camille etc.
Camille cannot be last: eliminates orders like Margot, Hermione, Camille etc.

Let's enumerate the possible orders without restrictions:
1. Hermione, Margot, Camille
2. Hermione, Camille, Margot
3. Margot, Hermione, Camille
4. Margot, Camille, Hermione
5. Camille, Hermione, Margot
6. Camille, Margot, Hermione

Now apply the restrictions:
1. Hermione, Margot, Camille - Hermione cannot be first. Eliminate
2. Hermione, Camille, Margot - Hermione cannot be first. Eliminate
3. Margot, Hermione, Camille - Camille cannot be last. Eliminate
4. Margot, Camille, Hermione - Valid
5. Camille, Hermione, Margot - Valid
6. Camille, Margot, Hermione - Margot cannot be second. Eliminate

Remaining valid orders are:
1. Margot, Camille, Hermione
2. Camille, Hermione, Margot

However, let's consider the condition of Margot not being second, which leaves us with the possibility (C, H, M).
Consider the cases when Hermione isn't first.
(M, C, H), (C, H, M), (C, M, H), (M,H,C) are valid.

Then Margot not second allows: (C, H, M), (H,C,M)
Then, Camille not last gives: (M, C, H)
(C, H, M)
(C, M, H)
(M,H,C)
So, with H not first, we need to eliminate the other options that break the other 2 rules. 
If M is first, we get (M,C,H), which follows all rules. If C is first, we get (C,H,M), which follows all rules.
If H is first, we should disregard since H is not first.
If M is first, M cannot be second, so (M,C,H) is the option, so (C,H,M) has Camille first then.
Let Hermione be last. Then the options are: (M,C,H) and (C,M,H). Camille is not last, so we should not end here with C last. Margot second does not work, H should be last. 

Final:
Margot, Camille, Hermione
Camille, Hermione, Margot

Therefore, there are 2 possible orders.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
1. List all 6 possible orders: HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
2. Apply the first restriction (H not first): MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
3. Apply the second restriction (M not second): MHC, CHM
4. Apply the third restriction (C not last): MHC
Only 2 orders that satisfy are : MCH and CHM. The only one that is valid is CHM.

The valid options are MHC, CHM and MCH.
Consider the order: MCH = Margot, Camille, Hermione
Consider the order: CHM = Camille, Hermione, Margot
Consider the order: MHC = Margot, Hermione, Camille (does not comply to C can't be last rule, not valid).
So, valid orders are CHM and MCH.

Reasoning:

Total possible orders without restriction are 3! = 6.

Hermione cannot be first. This means the first position can only be filled by Margot or Camille.
Margot cannot be second.
Camille cannot be last.

Let's enumerate the possibilities:
1. Margot is first: M _ _ : Since Margot cannot be second, we can only have M C H. This order meets all the requirements.
2. Camille is first: C _ _ : Since Camille cannot be last, we have C H M or C M H. But Margot cannot be second, so we can have C H M. This also works.
Let's say Hermione is first. This violates the first rule.
3. Hermione is in the middle: C H M and M H C. We already have C H M.
4. H last: C M H and M C H. (Margot cannot be second, meaning C is the second person. Invalid.
5. Let Hermione be second. We will see whether the other cases meet the restrictions
We can have only C H M or M H C
Total combinations possible: C H M and M C H
Since H is never first, this rules out 3!/3 = 2
Since M is never second, then there can be: X H X, where X X X represents the people. so this gets ruled by 2! = 2 orders and not that big for rule to exist on Hermione/Margot/Camille

Therefore, 2 valid orders exists. Margot, Camille, Hermione.

Final Answer:
Reasoning:
Let's enumerate all possibilities and eliminate based on the given constraints:
Total possibilities = 3! = 6
1. Hermione, Margot, Camille (HMC) - Hermione cannot be first. Invalid.
2. Hermione, Camille, Margot (HCM) - Hermione cannot be first. Invalid.
3. Margot, Hermione, Camille (MHC) - Camille cannot be last. Invalid.
4. Margot, Camille, Hermione (MCH) - Valid.
5. Camille, Hermione, Margot (CHM) - Valid.
6. Camille, Margot, Hermione (CMH) - Margot cannot be second. Invalid.

Therefore, only two orders are valid: Margot, Camille, Hermione (MCH) and Camille, Hermione, Margot (CHM).

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let's analyze each condition:
1. Hermione not first: Possible combinations - M**, C**
2. Margot not second: Possible combinations - H** , C**
3. Camille not last: Possible combinations - **H, **M

Now combine the conditions:
Possible orders:
1. MCH (Margot, Camille, Hermione) : Fulfills all conditions
2. CHM (Camille, Hermione, Margot) : Fulfills all conditions

Therefore there are 2 orders

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let's list all possible permutations and eliminate based on the rules:
1. HMC - Hermione can't be first.
2. HCM - Hermione can't be first.
3. MHC - Camille can't be last.
4. MCH - Valid.
5. CHM - Valid.
6. CMH - Margot can't be second.

So we have two valid permutations: MCH and CHM.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
List all 6 permutations: HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH.
- Hermione not first: eliminate HMC and HCM leaving MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH.
- Margot not second: eliminate CMH leaving MHC, MCH, CHM.
- Camille not last: eliminate MHC leaving MCH, CHM.

Thus, two orders are possible: MCH and CHM.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There are a total of 3! = 6 permutations of the three people.
1. Hermione can't be first.
2. Margot can't be second.
3. Camille can't be last.
Let's enumerate the 6 possibilities and eliminate based on these rules:
1. HMC - invalid (Hermione is first)
2. HCM - invalid (Hermione is first)
3. MHC - invalid (Camille is last)
4. MCH - valid
5. CHM - valid
6. CMH - invalid (Margot is second)

Therefore there are only 2 possible orders

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total permutations = 3! = 6
HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH

Rules:
Hermione cannot be first
Margot cannot be second
Camille cannot be last

HMC = Invalid (Hermione first)
HCM = Invalid (Hermione first)
MHC = Invalid (Camille last)
MCH = Valid
CHM = Valid
CMH = Invalid (Margot second)

Therefore, only 2 possible orders.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Possible orderings are:
HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH

Hermione can't be first eliminates HMC, HCM
Margot can't be second eliminates CMH
Camille can't be last eliminates MHC

This leaves us with MCH and CHM or 2 possible orderings

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There are 3! = 6 possible orderings. We can remove orderings that break one of the three conditions to get our answer.

1. Hermione can't be first: eliminates HMC, HCM
2. Margot can't be second: eliminates CMH
3. Camille can't be last: eliminates MHC

What is left are MCH and CHM.

Therefore there are 2 valid orderings.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
First list all permutations:
Hermione, Margot, Camille (HMC)
Hermione, Camille, Margot (HCM)
Margot, Hermione, Camille (MHC)
Margot, Camille, Hermione (MCH)
Camille, Hermione, Margot (CHM)
Camille, Margot, Hermione (CMH)

Then filter based on the rules:
Hermione never first, so HMC and HCM are not possible.
Margot never second, so CMH is not possible.
Camille never last, so MHC is not possible.

The possible combinations are therefore MCH and CHM. So there are 2.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let us represent the 3 persons as H, M, C
The total possible arrangement of people without restriction is 3! = 6
The first restriction is that H cannot be the first one
The second restriction is that M cannot be the second one
The third restriction is that C cannot be the last one

Let's list the arrangements:
HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH

Apply 1st restriction, we are left with : MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
Apply 2nd restriction, we are left with : MHC, CHM
The valid permutations are {MCH, CHM}

There are only 2 possible orders

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There are 3! = 6 possible orderings, these are: HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH.
We know:
1. Hermione can't be first. This eliminates HMC and HCM.
2. Margot can't be second. This eliminates CMH.
3. Camille can't be last. This eliminates MHC.

The only orderings left are MCH and CHM.
Therefore, there are 2 orderings.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The total possible permutations are 3! = 6
HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH

Hermione is never first:  eliminate HMC and HCM, leaving MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
Margot is never second: eliminate CMH, leaving MHC, MCH, CHM
Camille is never last: eliminate MHC, leaving MCH, CHM

The possible orders are MCH and CHM, hence 2.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There are 3! = 6 permutations.
1. HMC - H can't be first
2. HCM - H can't be first
3. MHC - C can't be last
4. MCH - Valid
5. CHM - Valid
6. CMH - M can't be second

Therefore only 2

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The three conditions are: H cant be first. M cant be 2nd. C cant be last. The possible orders are: 
HMC
HCM
MHC
MCH
CHM
CMH
So we eliminate all options which break the conditions. 
H cant be first: HMC is invalid. HCM is invalid. 
M cant be 2nd: CMH is invalid.
C cant be last: MHC is invalid. 
MCH is valid. CHM is valid. 
So the only valid options are: MCH and CHM. 
There are 2 possible orderings

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
List the permutations of the three names.
HMC
HCM
MHC
MCH
CHM
CMH

Now apply the constraints
H not first. So no HMC, no HCM
M not second. So no CMH
C not last. So no MHC

Only MCH and CHM are remaining.
Therefore, the answer is 2.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total permutations = 3! = 6

HMC (Hermione, Margot, Camille) - invalid, H first
HCM (Hermione, Camille, Margot) - invalid, H first
MHC (Margot, Hermione, Camille) - invalid, C last
MCH (Margot, Camille, Hermione) - valid
CHM (Camille, Hermione, Margot) - valid
CMH (Camille, Margot, Hermione) - invalid, M second

The answer is 2.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total possible permutations = 3! = 6
HMC
HCM
MHC
MCH
CHM
CMH

1. Hermione not first => MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
2. Margot not second => MHC, CHM
3. Camille not last => CHM
Possible errors in process/ thought. start from fresh

Since M and C have positions in question, we have:
MC...
MH
CM...
CH
.HC
.MC

M** C cannot be last, MCH
C** can't be second H. => CH. M then CHM

So MCH and CHM, hence 2

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There are six permutations total of the order in which the three people can enter. These are HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, and CMH.
We know:
Hermione cannot be first: This eliminates HMC and HCM. We are left with MHC, MCH, CHM, and CMH.
Margot cannot be second: This eliminates CMH. We are left with MHC, MCH, and CHM.
Camille cannot be last: This eliminates MHC. We are left with MCH and CHM.
Therefore there are two possible orders: MCH and CHM

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
We have three people, Hermione (H), Margot (M), and Camille (C).
The total possible arrangements without any restrictions is 3! = 6
They are: HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
1. Hermione cannot be first. This eliminates HMC and HCM. Remaining orders are MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH.
2. Margot cannot be second. This eliminates CMH. Remaining orders are MHC, MCH, CHM.
3. Camille cannot be last. This eliminates MHC. Remaining orders are MCH, CHM.

The possible orders are Margot, Camille, Hermione (MCH) and Camille, Hermione, Margot (CHM).
Therefore the number of different orders is 2.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:

Let the total possible orders be 3! = 6
HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH

1. H cannot be first. - Removes HMC and HCM
Remaining are: MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH

2. M cannot be second - Removes CMH
Remaining are: MHC, MCH, CHM

3. C cannot be last - Removes MHC
Remaining are: MCH, CHM

There are two possible arrangements that satisfies the given conditions.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total possible combinations without constraint = 3! = 6
These are:
HMC
HCM
MHC
MCH
CHM
CMH

Now applying constraints
1. H cannot be first
2. M cannot be second
3. C cannot be last

Eliminating all invalid entries we get
1. HMC = invalid (H first)
2. HCM = invalid (H first)
3. MHC = invalid (C last)
4. MCH = valid
5. CHM = valid
6. CMH = invalid (M second)

Valid combinations = MCH and CHM
Total valid combinations = 2

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let's list all possible permutations of the three girls:

HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH

Now apply the restrictions.

H can't be first: This eliminates HMC, HCM

M can't be second: This eliminates CMH

C can't be last: This eliminates MHC

So, we are left with MCH and CHM, a total of 2 possible orderings.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let's list all the possible combinations of the orders :
HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH.
Now applying the constraints to the above listed orders :
H can't be first : Thus HMC, HCM is invalid. We are left with MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
M can't be second : Thus CMH is invalid. We are left with MHC, MCH, CHM
C can't be last : Thus MHC is invalid. We are left with MCH, CHM
Therefore there are two possible orders i.e. MCH and CHM

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total Possible Orders: HMC HCM MHC MCH CHM CMH
Conditions: H can not be first; M can not be second; C can not be last
Applying Conditions:
HMC not valid
HCM not valid
MHC not valid
MCH valid
CHM valid
CMH not valid
The remaining valid orders: MCH CHM
There are 2 valid orders.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total number of arrangements = 3! = 6
Let us list them down
HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH

Condition 1: H cannot be first, that implies: MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH

Condition 2: M cannot be second, that implies: MHC, CHM

Condition 3: C cannot be last, that implies: MHC

By going by each step there are 2 ways by considering C cannot be last in the other 3 orders. Therefore only B remains.

Lets consider the conditions as following:
Hermione can not be first.
Margot can not be second.
Camille can not be last.

Now these are MCH, CHM

Therefore Answer = 2

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total combinations 3! = 6

HMC
HCM
MHC
MCH
CHM
CMH

Now use conditions:
1: Hermione cant be first: Eliminate HMC & HCM.
Remaining: MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH

2: Margot cant be second: Eliminate CMH
Remaining: MHC, MCH, CHM

3: Camille cant be last: Eliminate MHC
Remaining: MCH, CHM

Possible combinations are 2:

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There are 3! = 6 total possible orderings:
HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH

1.  H cannot be first. This eliminates HMC and HCM.  Leaves MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH.
2.  M cannot be second. This eliminates CMH.  Leaves MHC, MCH, CHM.
3.  C cannot be last. This eliminates MHC. Leaves MCH, CHM.

There are two valid orderings, therefore the answer is B.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The 3 names can be ordered in 3! = 6 different ways.

1) Hermione, Margot, Camille (HMC) - invalid, Hermione is first
2) Hermione, Camille, Margot (HCM) - invalid, Hermione is first
3) Margot, Hermione, Camille (MHC) - invalid, Camille is last
4) Margot, Camille, Hermione (MCH) - valid
5) Camille, Hermione, Margot (CHM) - valid
6) Camille, Margot, Hermione (CMH) - invalid, Margot is second

Therefore, only MCH and CHM satisfy all the rules, so there are 2 possible orders.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Possible arrangements: HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH.

Eliminate Hermione being first:
MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH

Eliminate Margot being second:
MHC, CHM

Eliminate Camille being last:
MCH, CHM

Therefore there are 2 possible orders.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total permutations are 3! = 6
Permutations: HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH

Restrictions:
Hermione (H) can't be first: eliminate HMC, HCM
Margot (M) can't be second: eliminate CMH
Camille (C) can't be last: eliminate MHC

Therefore the possible orderings are MCH and CHM. Total = 2.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The total arrangements are: 3!= 6 arrangements. They are HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH.

1. Restrictions: H cannot be first, thus eliminate HMC and HCM leaving: MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
2. M can not be second, thus eliminate CMH leaving: MHC, MCH, CHM
3. C can not be last, thus eliminate MHC leaving: MCH, CHM

Therefore, the answer is 2.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
We can find the number of valid permutations by listing all permutations and eliminating the invalid ones.
There are 3! = 6 total permutations:
1. HMC: Hermione cannot be first. Invalid.
2. HCM: Hermione cannot be first. Invalid.
3. MHC: Camille cannot be last. Invalid.
4. MCH: Valid.
5. CHM: Valid.
6. CMH: Margot cannot be second. Invalid.

The only valid permutations are MCH and CHM. Therefore, there are 2 possible orderings.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
All possible orders of entering are:
HMC
HCM
MHC
MCH
CHM
CMH

Now we apply the conditions:
Hermione isn't first: -> MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
Margot isn't second: -> MHC, CHM
Camille isn't last: -> MCH, CHM

Possible: MCH and CHM: There are two.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total permutations = 3! = 6
Possible permutations: HMC HCM MHC MCH CHM CMH

Hermione not first: MHC MCH CHM CMH (remove HMC HCM)
Margot not second: MHC CHM (remove CMH)
Camille not last: MCH CHM (remove MHC)

Possible answers: MCH CHM

Therefore 2 possible arrangements

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
List all permutations: HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
-H can't be first: removes HMC, HCM. Remaining: MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
-M can't be second: removes CMH. Remaining: MHC, MCH, CHM
-C can't be last: removes MHC. Remaining: MCH, CHM

Therefore, the final answer is 2.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let H, M, and C represent Hermione, Margot, and Camille respectively.
Total possible permutations of the three girls is 3! = 6: HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH

Now, we apply the restrictions:
1. Hermione cannot be first. So, we eliminate HMC and HCM. This leaves: MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH.
2. Margot cannot be second. So, we eliminate CMH. This leaves: MHC, MCH, CHM.
3. Camille cannot be last. So, we eliminate MHC. This leaves: MCH, CHM.

The possible orders are MCH and CHM, which gives us a total of 2.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total number of ways the 3 people can enter is 3! = 6
Permutations are: HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH

Restrictions are: H cannot be first. M cannot be second. C cannot be last
Applying the restrictions one by one:
1. H cannot be first. This removes HMC and HCM giving MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
2. M cannot be second. This removes CMH from the list, leaving MHC, MCH, CHM
3. C cannot be last. This removes MHC from the list, leaving MCH, CHM
So, the total possible ways of entering are just 2

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total Permutations: 3! = 6

HMC
HCM
MHC
MCH
CHM
CMH

- H can't be first
Remaining: MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
- M can't be second
Remaining: MHC, CHM
- C can't be last
Remaining: MCH, CHM - Oops... I messed that up
Okay restart... list total number of ways it could happen without considering restrictions.
3 ways to pick first element. 2 ways to pick second. 1 way to pick last
Total arrangements (no restriction) = 6
Restrictions
H cant be first
M cant be second
C cant be last
1. What are arrangements where Hermione isn't first?
MCH, CHM, MHC, CMH
2. Remove all that have Margot in second
MCH, CHM
3. Remove all that have Camille in last
MCH, CHM

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total permutations: 3! = 6
They are: HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH.

1. H not first: 6 permutations drop to 4 i.e. MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
2. M not second: 4 permutations drop to 3: MHC, CHM (CMH is invalid for above)
3. C not last: 3 permutations drop to 2: MCH, CHM (MHC is invalid)

Hence, only 2 permutations are valid.
The combinations are 2.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
3!=6 possible outcomes, HMC HCM MHC MCH CHM CMH
1. H not first: MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
2. M not second: MHC, CHM, MCH, CHM
3. C not last: MCH CHM

So, the possible outcomes are 2

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
First, consider all possible orderings of the three people:
HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH

Next, consider that H cannot be first. This means we can eliminate HMC and HCM. This leaves:
MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH

Now, consider that M cannot be second. This means we can eliminate CMH. This leaves:
MHC, MCH, CHM

Finally, consider that C cannot be last. This means we can eliminate MHC. This leaves:
MCH, CHM

Therefore, there are 2 possible orderings that satisfy these conditions.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let us list down all the possible orders without any restrictions.
Hermione, Margot, Camille (HMC)
Hermione, Camille, Margot (HCM)
Margot, Hermione, Camille (MHC)
Margot, Camille, Hermione (MCH)
Camille, Hermione, Margot (CHM)
Camille, Margot, Hermione (CMH)

Condition 1: Hermione cannot be first. This eliminates HMC and HCM.
Remaining options are: MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
Condition 2: Margot cannot be second. This eliminates CMH.
Remaining options are: MHC, MCH, CHM
Condition 3: Camille cannot be last. This eliminates MHC.
Remaining options are: MCH, CHM
The possible combinations = 2

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total possible permutations are 3! = 6.
These are: HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
1.  H can't be first -> Remove HMC and HCM. The remaining orders are: MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
2.  M can't be second -> Remove CMH. The remaining orders are: MHC, MCH, CHM
3.  C can't be last -> Remove MHC. The remaining orders are: MCH, CHM
Thus, the remaining combinations = 2

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Here are all possible scenarios:

Hermione, Margot, Camille (HMC)
Hermione, Camille, Margot (HCM)
Margot, Hermione, Camille (MHC)
Margot, Camille, Hermione (MCH)
Camille, Hermione, Margot (CHM)
Camille, Margot, Hermione (CMH)

Here are the constraints:
Hermione cannot be the first, which leaves us with:
Margot, Hermione, Camille (MHC)
Margot, Camille, Hermione (MCH)
Camille, Hermione, Margot (CHM)
Camille, Margot, Hermione (CMH)

Margot cannot be second, which leaves us with:
Margot, Hermione, Camille (MHC)
Camille, Hermione, Margot (CHM)

Camille cannot be last, which leaves us with:
Margot, Camille, Hermione (MCH)
Camille, Hermione, Margot (CHM)

Therefore, the two possible scenarios are: MCH and CHM
So the answer is 2.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There are 3! = 6 possible orderings, let's denote them by HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH.
- H can't be first, so HMC and HCM are not possible. Then, possible orderings are MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH.
- M can't be second, so CMH is not possible. Then, possible orderings are MHC, MCH, CHM.
- C can't be last, so MHC is not possible. Then, possible orderings are MCH, CHM.
So there are 2 possibilities.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
1. Total orders without restriction: 3! = 6
HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH.
2. H cannot be first: MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
3. M cannot be second: MHC, CHM
4. C cannot be last: MHC

So the answer is 2

Reasoning: 
There are 6 ways to arrange the 3 people. We must eliminate all scenarios that violate any of the rules, so let’s start listing the orders: HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH 

- Hermione cannot be first: this removes HMC and HCM leaving MHC MCH CHM CMH
- Margot cannot be second: this removes CMH leaving MHC MCH CHM
- Camille cannot be last: this removes MHC leaving MCH CHM
The answer is 2 

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let us analyze each permutation of the 3 names one by one and see what survives

HMC - Invalid since Hermione enters first
HCM - Invalid since Hermione enters first
MHC - Invalid since Camille enters last
MCH - Valid
CHM - Valid
CMH - Invalid since Margot enters second

Only MCH and CHM are valid. Therefore there are 2 valid permutations.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The total permutations are: HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
Hermione cannot be first => MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
Margot cannot be second => MHC, CHM
Camille cannot be last => MCH, CHM

Hence, there are two possible permutations (MCH, CHM).

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
First list out the possible combinations of entrants.
HMC
HCM
MHC
MCH
CHM
CMH

Next we consider each of the constraints:
H cannot be first. This cancels HMC and HCM.
M cannot be second. This cancels CMH.
C cannot be last. This cancels MHC.

This leaves MCH and CHM which gives us 2.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total number of possible arrangements=3!=6
HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
Restriction 1: H can't be first - MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
Restriction 2: M can't be second -MHC, CHM
Restriction 3: C can't be last -MCH CHM.

So 2 ways

Answer: B)
Reasoning:

There are 3! = 6 total permutations for the order in which they enter the class:

HMC - H can't be first
HCM - H can't be first
MHC - C can't be last
MCH - Possible
CHM - Possible
CMH - M can't be second

Thus, the only 2 that work are MCH and CHM. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
1.  Total possible arrangements are 3! = 6
2.  Listing them are:
HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
3.  Apply the constraints:
    * Hermione is never the first, so, HMC, and HCM are invalidated
    * Margot is never the second, so CMH is invalidated
    * Camille is never the last, so MHC is invalidated
4.  Remaining are MCH, CHM
So the answer is 2

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let's start with the basic permutations of the three girls (H = Hermione, M = Margot, C = Camille)
Total possible permutations = 3! = 6
These are:
HMC
HCM
MHC
MCH
CHM
CMH

Now we have the following restrictions:
1. Hermione (H) cannot be first. This eliminates HMC and HCM.
2. Margot (M) cannot be second. This eliminates CMH.
3. Camille (C) cannot be last. This eliminates MHC.

Thus, only MCH and CHM fulfill all the requirements.
Hence, the answer is 2.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
First, list all possible permutations:
1. HMC
2. HCM
3. MHC
4. MCH
5. CHM
6. CMH

Restrictions:
1. H can't be first: exclude 1, 2 --> MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
2. M can't be second: exclude 6 --> MHC, MCH, CHM
3. C can't be last: exclude 3 --> MCH, CHM

So only two are valid.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The possible arrangements are as follows:
HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
Condition 1: Hermione is not the first to enter (remove HMC and HCM):
MHC, MCH, CHM, CMH
Condition 2: Margot is not the second to enter (remove CMH):
MHC, MCH, CHM
Condition 3: Camille is not the last to enter (remove MHC):
MCH, CHM

There are 2 arrangements remaining.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total possible orders without constraints: 3! = 6
HMC, HCM, MHC, MCH, CHM,
