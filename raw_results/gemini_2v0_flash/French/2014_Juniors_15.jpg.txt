Reasoning:
The sum of the angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees. In the quadrilateral shown, we have angles x, y, z and α.
Therefore, x + y + z + α = 360. We are given x = 22, y = 39, and z = 23.
So, 22 + 39 + 23 + α = 360, which means 84 + α = 360.
Therefore, α = 360 - 84 = 276.
However, α is an interior angle. The sum of angles of the triangle at the top left of the quadrilateral is 180, so the angle that meets α is 180-(22+39)=180-61=119
And the sum of angles of the triangle at the bottom right is 180 so the angle that meets α is 180-(23+y') where y' is the angle next to y. The sum of the exterior angles are 360. So we have 360-(x+z+y+a). From the diagram we see x, y, z, and a make up the angles inside the quadrilateral. 22 + 39 + 23 + α = 360, 84 + α = 360, α = 360 - 84. Now we can see 360 -84 = 276. But α is one angle in the quadrilateral so we must deduct this value from 360 to get the internal angle of α. 360-276 does not exist from the option.
Let's assume the shape is actually quadrilateral. sum of x, y, z, and angle alpha should be 360. x+y+z = 22 + 39 + 23 = 84. So alpha = 360-84 = 276. Looking at the diagram, alpha cannot be that big. So let's analyze this in a different way.
Let the two missing angles of the triangles adjacent to alpha be A and B. The angles of the larger triangle on the left will be 22, 39, and A. Therefore 22 + 39 + A = 180. 61 + A = 180. A = 180 - 61 = 119. The angles of the smaller triangle on the right will be 23 and B. Therefore 23 + B + y' = 180. 23+ B + y'= 180, where y' is the angle to y and on the same line as z. Since y and y' are on a line, y' + y = 180, and y = 39, therefore y' = 180 - 39 = 141. 23 + 141 +B =180
Since we do not know all internal angles, nor can derive. Let try assuming the two lines next to y and z are parallel, which makes x and alpha supplementary angles. that means the angles add to 180. this make alpha equal to 158. This does not seem to be the correct way.
Let us reconsider the fact that the diagram presents a quadrilateral whose angles are x, y, z and α. Thus x+y+z+α = 360, as before x+y+z = 84 and α=360-84 = 276.
From here if we take the external angles in the diagram, y' = 180-39=141. z' = 180-23 = 157. x' = 180-22 = 158 and alpha' = 360-a

Let consider the sum of the internal angles of the two triangles that share an angle with alpha in the original question. triangle 1 : 180 = 22+39+a' where a' is the angle that share edge with alpha, which is angle alpha.
Triangle 2. Internal angle sum = z + y + alpha = 360
Considering external angle on line connecting z to alpha, the external angle is 180-y
Sum of external angles formula. Let's forget it.
Based on x+y+z+alpha=360. The image shows that its not.
It is likely that the problem is testing if we know sum of angles of quadrilateral is 360. And we have angles x, y, z, and α. Then
x+y+z+alpha = 360
22+39+23+alpha = 360
84+alpha=360
alpha = 276. However, the choices show it might not be an external angle.
Upon reviewing similar problems, I remembered a rule regarding exterior angles. The exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles. By drawing a line at alpha to create triangle with x and y and use it on the small angle created by Z. this does not appear to be correct way.

Let's think about this as two triangles sharing an adjacent angle alpha. Therefore, considering angles in a triangle are 180, x=22 y=39, 180-22-39= 119. This implies there exist an angle with is 119 degree from alpha. This means angle next to Z = 180-119 = 61. If Z angle is 23, we have another triangle. Then
alpha = 119-39. This cannot work. I will guess alpha as D)84

Reasoning:
The sum of the angles around a point is 360 degrees. Looking at the angles around the vertex at angle α, we see angles x, y, and z contribute to defining the angle around that point. The interior angle α completes that 360 degrees. In the two triangles and the shape we create:
x + y + z + α = 360 degrees. Given the values, α = 360 - (x + y + z) = 360 - (22 + 39 + 23) = 360 - 84 = 276. However, the interior angle α is very likely to be 84 as exterior and interior must complete 360 degree circle, not an actual physical vertex. So
If we draw imaginary lines inside angles the triangles and quadrilateral we do not have many clues and no solution to resolve. But since it is the first Geometry problem it must simple.

Let's explore a special case: if we pretend alpha equals 90 angle.
Looking back at the answers, let us see which numbers that may close to forming a shape around alpha.
Then alpha = 360-x-y-z is equivalent to interior angle a'= 360 - x - y -z where this angle in the quadrilateral is around 276
Let us pretend 276 -90 is equal to 186 which does make a quadrilateral, since it is the remainder 186 + 22+ 39+ 23 is 270.

So how to do it is we draw an imaginary line,
After reviewing the diagram and the numbers, what are the angle addition or subtraction relationships in the shapes?
22, 39 and 23 are related to alpha.
Since total angles = 360. Then alpha = (90)+ (60)/2 =84?

However I will try to derive what happens on a shape.
sum_angles triangle + sum angle triagnle and quadrilateral = x-y-alpha

Let consider the answer,
A) = 94 this is a high number compared to x, y, z.
B) = 90 similar to above
C) = 88 similar to above
D) = 84 x+y+z should equal 84
E) = 82 similar

So what relationships exist? We can't derive

Answer: D)
