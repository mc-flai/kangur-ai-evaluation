Reasoning:
The available digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Each must be used exactly once. The sum of the digits in the units place must equal the digit in the units place of the answer. Let's denote the two digits in the units place of the addends by x and y, and the digit in the units place of the answer by z. Then x + y = z. From the options, we need to find which of these numbers can occupy the z position.

We have:
A) If z=2, then x+y=2. Possible values are 0+2, 1+1, 2+0. Since all digits must be different, we can have 0+2. This means that 0 and 2 are used.
B) If z=3, then x+y=3. Possible values are 0+3, 1+2, 2+1, 3+0. Since all digits must be different, we can have 0+3 or 1+2.
C) If z=4, then x+y=4. Possible values are 0+4, 1+3, 2+2, 3+1, 4+0. Since all digits must be different, we can have 0+4 or 1+3.
D) If z=5, then x+y=5. Possible values are 0+5, 1+4, 2+3, 3+2, 4+1, 5+0. Since all digits must be different, we can have 0+5, 1+4, 2+3.
E) If z=6, then x+y=6. Possible values are 0+6, 1+5, 2+4, 3+3, 4+2, 5+1, 6+0. Since all digits must be different, we can have 0+6, 1+5, 2+4.

Let's analyze using the remaining digits to complete the sums and see if we can find a working addition problem:
Let the sum be AB + CD = EFz. We've already used digits x, y, z.
A=1, B=0. C=5, D=4. Sum = 60 + 40 = 100
Case D: z=5, x=1, y=4. Possible combinations: A, B, C, D = {0, 2, 3, 6}.
Let's attempt to find a valid set. 23 + 01 = 24. Invalid since it includes numbers we used.
If A = 23 + 61. z=5. It could equal 84 = invalid since we used 4 as the first number.
It's impossible to complete an addition that uses 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

However, if the problem implies that *only* the numbers 0 to 6 are allowed in *any* of the squares, then the problem is not possible, and we have to infer that at least two numbers in the addition sum to the number in the shaded box.
So, let's consider z=3.
The smallest possible addition that adds to 3 will be 0 + 3. Then the other digits could be, for example, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. We are missing digits to fill the two numbers for a proper addition.
Let's consider z=5.
The smallest possible addition that adds to 5 will be 0 + 5. Then the other digits could be, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Still missing.
Let's consider z=4. Then 1 + 3 = 4. Then the other digits could be, for example, 0, 2, 5, 6. Still missing.
With these restrictions, the only possible sum we can achieve is 1 + 2 = 3. Then the remaining digits are 0, 4, 5, 6.

So, let us test out the addition 10+2 =12. Using these numbers: 0,1,2 the only option is 1+2=3
Let's try 0 + 4 = 4: Using numbers 0, 4. Possible digits: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6.

It will be 3, because 0+3.
1+2=3.

Reasoning:
Let's try to find the correct answer by trying each option. Suppose the last digit of the result is 'z'. Since we are adding two numbers, we can say x + y = z, where x and y are the last digits of the addends. Also, all the digits used in the addition problem must be distinct.
A) z = 2. Then we can have x = 0 and y = 2 or x = 1 and y = 1. But we must have distinct digits, so we take x=0, y=2. Then the numbers available for the other positions are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6.
B) z = 3. Then we can have x = 0 and y = 3 or x = 1 and y = 2. Then the numbers available for the other positions are 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 or 0, 3, 4, 5, 6.
C) z = 4. Then we can have x = 0 and y = 4 or x = 1 and y = 3. Then the numbers available for the other positions are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 or 0, 2, 4, 5, 6.
D) z = 5. Then we can have x = 0 and y = 5 or x = 1 and y = 4 or x = 2 and y = 3. Then the numbers available for the other positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 0, 2, 3, 5, 6.
E) z = 6. Then we can have x = 0 and y = 6 or x = 1 and y = 5 or x = 2 and y = 4. Then the numbers available for the other positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 0, 2, 3, 5, 6.

Let's take B, where the numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. and z=3. x=1, y=2 or x=0, y=3. We have the addition problem AB + CD = EF3, where A, B, C, D, E, F are from the set {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6}. Try 41 + 02 = 43.

Answer: B)
