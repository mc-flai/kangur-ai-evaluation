Reasoning:
We need to find which number is closest to the square root of 2021. We can estimate the square root of 2021 by considering the squares of the given options.
$35^2 = 1225$
$40^2 = 1600$
$45^2 = 2025$
$50^2 = 2500$
$55^2 = 3025$
Since 2025 is closest to 2021, the square root of 2021 is closest to 45.
