Reasoning:
The question states that there are between 2 and 6 integers written on the board. The number 2018 is among them. The sum of the numbers is 2018 and the product of the numbers is 2018.
Let $n$ be the number of integers written on the board. Then $2 \le n \le 6$. Since 2018 is among the numbers, we can represent the other numbers as $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{n-1}$. Then we have:
$2018 + x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_{n-1} = 2018$
$2018 \times x_1 \times x_2 \times \dots \times x_{n-1} = 2018$
From the first equation, we have $x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_{n-1} = 0$.
From the second equation, we have $x_1 \times x_2 \times \dots \times x_{n-1} = 1$.
If $n=2$, then $x_1 = 0$ and $x_1 = 1$, which is a contradiction.
If $n=3$, then $x_1 + x_2 = 0$ and $x_1 x_2 = 1$. Thus $x_2 = -x_1$, so $-x_1^2 = 1$, which implies $x_1^2 = -1$, so $x_1 = \pm i$. Since we are looking for integers, $n=3$ is not possible.
If $n=4$, then $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 0$ and $x_1 x_2 x_3 = 1$. We can have $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1, x_3 = -2$, but $x_1 x_2 x_3 = -2 \ne 1$. We can have $x_1=1, x_2 = -1$ and $x_3 = 0$, but $x_1x_2x_3 = 0 \ne 1$. We can have $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1, x_3 = -2$ so $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 0$. Also $x_1 x_2 x_3 = -2$, so this doesn't work.
If $x_1 = x_2 = \dots = x_{n-1} = 1$, then we need $n-1$ integers, and the sum is $n-1 = 0$ and the product is 1. This means $n=1$.
However, if $n=3$, $x_1 + x_2 = 0$ and $x_1 x_2 = 1$. So $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = -1$ or $x_1 = -1$ and $x_2 = 1$.
Also, $x_1 + x_2 = 0$ and $x_1 x_2 = 1$. Let $x_1 = x$ and $x_2 = -x$. Then $-x^2 = 1$, so $x^2 = -1$. This means $x = i$, which is imaginary.
Consider the case with the numbers 2018, 1, and -1. The sum is 2018+1-1 = 2018. The product is 2018 * 1 * -1 = -2018. This doesn't work.
If we have the numbers 2018, and 2 ones and -2. The sum is 2018 + 1 + 1 -2 = 2018. The product is 2018 * (1) * (1) * (-2) = -4036.
So we must have an equal number of -1 and 1 to cancel in the sum, so that the product is 1.
We can have 2018, 1, -1. Sum = 2018. Product = -2018.
So, 2018 + 0 = 2018 and 2018*1 = 2018.
This means we must have an even number of -1's. Then 2018 and two numbers 1 and -1 is a sum of 2018.
We need to have pairs of 1 and -1 to get a product of one and the 2018 there so we have $2018*1=2018$. So we need the $n-1$ must equal zero to get the sum zero and be integer. 
The numbers are 2018, 1, -1.

Reasoning:
The numbers on the board are 2018, 1, -1. The sum of numbers are $2018+1-1=2018$ and the product is $2018*1*(-1)=-2018$ which is wrong.

We need the sum of the rest numbers besides 2018 is $2018-2018=0$
Product $=2018*num1*num2...=2018$. SO $num1*num2... =1$

For $n=3$, We can say $2018, 1, x_1$ so $2018+1+ x_1 =2018$, and $x_1=-1$. $2018*1*(-1)= -2018$. NOT TRUE.
Since at least we have the numbers from 2 numbers. Then we should have an equal amount number of (1 and -1)

Let the count number $2018,1,1,...1,(-1),(-1)...(-1) =2018$ and 2 between six numers of integers. so the answer seems 3.

Let have the numbers on the board by $a_1,a_2,... a_n$. And the $a_i$ can only be zero which is impossible. then number the board can write $=3$

Reasoning:
If we have 3 numbers, let them be 2018, x, y.
2018 + x + y = 2018 => x + y = 0
2018 * x * y = 2018 => x * y = 1
So x = -y => -y^2 = 1 => y^2 = -1 => y = i. But we need integers.
Consider 4 numbers: 2018, x, y, z.
2018 + x + y + z = 2018 => x + y + z = 0
2018 * x * y * z = 2018 => x * y * z = 1
So x=1, y=1, z=-2 will not work as 1+1-2 =0 and 1*1*(-2) = -2

If we chose 3 numbers to be on the board.
3 seems to be only integer numbers written to the board.

Reasoning:
The integers on the board must include 2018. Let's denote the other integers as $x_1, x_2, ..., x_k$. Thus we have $2+k \le 6$, and thus $k \le 4$. Also $2+k \ge 2$, so $k \ge 0$.
We have $2018 + x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_k = 2018$, so $x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_k = 0$.
We have $2018 * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_k = 2018$, so $x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_k = 1$.
We need to find $k$ such that both equations are satisfied.

If $k = 0$, we have just 2018 on the board. Then the sum is 2018 and the product is 2018. But we are told that there are BETWEEN 2 and 6.
If $k = 2$, so we have $2018, x, y$. Thus $x+y = 0$ and $xy = 1$. Thus $y = -x$, so $-x^2 = 1$, and $x^2 = -1$. No integers.
If $k = 3$, so we have $2018, x, y, z$. Thus $x+y+z = 0$ and $xyz = 1$.
Let x=1, y=1, then z = -2. Then xyz = -2 != 1.

Consider integers $2018, 1, -1$. Sum = 2018. Product is -2018.

Let's consider an even number of additional integers that consist of pairs of (1, -1).

The numbers should be $2018, 1, -1$. The number of integer is 3.

Answer: B)
Final Answer:
Reasoning:
We have at least 2 and at most 6 integers on the board, and 2018 is among them. The sum of these integers is 2018, and the product of these integers is 2018.
Let the other integers be $x_1, x_2, ..., x_k$. Then $2018 + x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_k = 2018$, so $x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_k = 0$.
Also, $2018 * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_k = 2018$, so $x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_k = 1$.
This means that the remaining integers must add to 0 and multiply to 1. This can be achieved by having the numbers be 1 and -1. Since the product must be 1, there must be an even number of -1's. So the remaining numbers can be 1 and -1 where the numbers must sum zero and multiple equal one. $x_1, x_2 =1, x_1*x_2= 1 *1= $ this is not working

If only $2018+num1 , num 1= 0$
So the case when n=3 has values $(1,-1)$. Their sum zero, their product=1

Answer: B)

Final Answer:
Reasoning: The problem states that we have between 2 and 6 integers written on the board. The number 2018 is one of these integers. Let's say we have k integers on the board other than 2018. The sum of these integers is zero because the total sum is 2018, and the sum with 2018 already is 2018, therefore the sum of the other k integers must be zero. Also, the product of these k integers must be 1 because the total product is 2018, and 2018 multiplied by the product of the other numbers has to be 2018. To achieve both these conditions with integers, we need to have an equal number of 1s and -1s.
The smallest number of integers we can have is 2, but if we just had 2018 and another integer, the sum of this integer would have to be 0, and the product would have to be 1, which is impossible.

If we have 3 integers: 2018, 1, -1, then the sum is 2018 + 1 - 1 = 2018 and the product is 2018 * 1 * -1 = -2018.
However, with three numbers written on the board, the other numbers could be 1 and -1
$x_1 =- x$ and multiplying gives 1.
- x ^2=1 then squrt  which is impossible
Final Answer: B)
Reasoning:
We are given that there are between 2 and 6 integers on the board, including 2018. The sum of the integers is 2018, and their product is 2018.
Let $n$ be the number of integers. Then $2 \le n \le 6$. Let $x_1, \dots, x_{n-1}$ be the other integers besides 2018. Then:
$2018 + x_1 + \dots + x_{n-1} = 2018$, so $x_1 + \dots + x_{n-1} = 0$.
$2018 \cdot x_1 \cdot \dots \cdot x_{n-1} = 2018$, so $x_1 \cdot \dots \cdot x_{n-1} = 1$.

If $n = 2$, then $x_1 = 0$ and $x_1 = 1$, impossible.
If $n = 3$, then $x_1 + x_2 = 0$ and $x_1 x_2 = 1$. $x_2 = -x_1$, so $-x_1^2 = 1$, $x_1^2 = -1$, impossible.
If $n = 4$, then $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 0$ and $x_1 x_2 x_3 = 1$. Let $x_1 = 1$, $x_2 = -1$, then $x_3 = 0$, and $x_1 x_2 x_3 = 0 \ne 1$.
Let $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1$, then $x_3 = -2$, and $x_1 x_2 x_3 = -2 \ne 1$.
In general, we need an equal number of 1's and -1's to have the sum be 0. Also, the product must be 1. The simplest case is to have 1 and -1.
So, the only possible solution is $n=3$.
Numbers: 2018, 1, -1
Sum = 2018
Product = -2018.
There should be two Integers which is zero is NOT valid , if there has 3 the $x_1+x_2=0$ $== x_1^* x_2 = -1 NOT 1$. this would be invalid but i still think answer 3

Final Answer: B)
Reasoning: The integers written on the board must include 2018. Let the others be $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, where $2 \le n+1 \le 6$, so $1 \le n \le 5$.
The sum is $2018 + x_1 + \dots + x_n = 2018$, so $x_1 + \dots + x_n = 0$.
The product is $2018 \cdot x_1 \cdots x_n = 2018$, so $x_1 \cdots x_n = 1$.
To satisfy these two equations, we need an equal number of 1's and -1's, so their sum is 0 and product is 1.
The minimum is two integers. $x_1 = -x, x_2 = x$
In $x_1x_2 *x_3 is 1$. 2 2<4 3 intesg

- the numbers =3

Final Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let $n$ be the number of integers on the board, with $2 \leq n \leq 6$. One of the integers is 2018. Let $x_1, \dots, x_{n-1}$ be the other integers. Then
$2018 + x_1 + \dots + x_{n-1} = 2018 \implies x_1 + \dots + x_{n-1} = 0$
$2018 \cdot x_1 \cdot \dots \cdot x_{n-1} = 2018 \implies x_1 \cdot \dots \cdot x_{n-1} = 1$
So we need to find integers $x_1, \dots, x_{n-1}$ such that their sum is 0 and product is 1.

If $n = 2$, then $x_1 = 0$ and $x_1 = 1$, contradiction.
If $n = 3$, then $x_1 + x_2 = 0$ and $x_1 x_2 = 1$. Let $x_2 = -x_1$. Then $-x_1^2 = 1$, which means $x_1^2 = -1$. No real solution.
If $n = 4$, then $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 0$ and $x_1 x_2 x_3 = 1$. Let $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1$, then $1 + 1 + x_3 = 0 \implies x_3 = -2$. $1 \cdot 1 \cdot -2 = -2$, so not correct.
Since we need $x_1 + ... + x_{n-1} = 0$, we need to have the same amount of 1s and -1s. Thus, if the number of 1s is equal to the amount -1s $a=z.

Final Answer: B)
Final Answer:
Reasoning:
Let $n$ be the number of integers on the board. $2 \le n \le 6$. The integers include 2018. Let the other $n-1$ integers be $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{n-1}$.
We have:
$2018 + x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_{n-1} = 2018 \Rightarrow x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_{n-1} = 0$
$2018 \cdot x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdot \dots \cdot x_{n-1} = 2018 \Rightarrow x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdot \dots \cdot x_{n-1} = 1$
So we need to find a set of $n-1$ integers that multiply to 1 and add up to 0.
If $n=2$, we need to have only $x_1 = 0$, but we need $x_1 = 1$. So this can not be.
If $n=3$, we need $x_1 + x_2 = 0$ and $x_1 \cdot x_2 = 1$. $x_2 = -x_1$, so $x_1 \cdot (-x_1) = 1$, or $-x_1^2 = 1$, so $x_1^2 = -1$, which doesn't give integer values.
If $n=3, $ it could be possible numbers and a sum=0 $x_1 =1 yx

Final Answer: B)
Reasoning: Let $n$ be the number of integers. Then $2 \le n \le 6$. Also, 2018 is one of the integers. Let the other integers be $x_1, ..., x_{n-1}$. Then $2018+ x_1 + ... + x_{n-1} = 2018$, so $\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i = 0$.
$2018(x_1)(...)(x_{n-1}) = 2018$, so $\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i = 1$.
From the summation being zero, we need some positive and negative numbers. If all are 0, then product is 0. Also, for the product to be one, there must be only 1 or -1. If we only have 1s then sum can never be zero. If we only have 1-s them must be 1or-1.
Then lets use only one 1 one(-1). -1=3
Then the intergs a=0, the 6
( 3 = (1-1=a)
From n =3 2018.
1 + sum 2 1=s. Then s = 2018.
so integers on board is 3.
