Reasoning:
The histogram shows three bars representing three species of trees. The heights of the bars (representing the numbers of trees) are different.
- The first bar (grey) has the highest height, representing the largest number of trees.
- The second bar (white) is lower than the first, representing a smaller number of trees than the first one.
- The third bar (black) has the lowest height, representing the least number of trees.
The pie chart must have sections representing these ratios/proportions. Thus the first/grey section should be the largest, the second/white section is intermediate, and the third/black section is the smallest.

Examining the options, we see that:
- A) has the black section larger than the white one.
- B) has the white section larger than the black one.
- C) has the white section larger than the black one.
- D) has the white section larger than the black one.
- E) has the black section larger than the white one.

Only diagrams B), C) and D) have the black section smaller than the white section, so the answer must be either B), C) or D).
The area of grey is larger than the sum of the areas of the other two. The only diagram which satisfies this is B).
The answer is B.

Answer: B)
