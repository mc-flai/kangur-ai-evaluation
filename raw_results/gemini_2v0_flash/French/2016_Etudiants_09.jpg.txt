Reasoning:
Let $n$ be the number of pieces, and $x$ be the length of each piece.
Then $2 = a \cdot x$ and $1 = b \cdot x$ for some integers $a$ and $b$.
Thus, $x = 2/a = 1/b$, which implies $a = 2b$.
Also, the total number of pieces is $n = a+b$. Substituting $a = 2b$, we have $n = 2b + b = 3b$.
This means $n$ must be a multiple of 3.

Now, we check the options:
A) 6 is a multiple of 3.  $6 = 3 \cdot 2$, so $b=2$, $a = 2b = 4$, and $x = 1/2$.
B) 8 is not a multiple of 3.
C) 9 is a multiple of 3.  $9 = 3 \cdot 3$, so $b=3$, $a=6$, and $x = 1/3$.
D) 12 is a multiple of 3. $12 = 3 \cdot 4$, so $b=4$, $a=8$, and $x = 1/4$.
E) 15 is a multiple of 3. $15 = 3 \cdot 5$, so $b=5$, $a=10$, and $x = 1/5$.

Therefore, the number of pieces cannot be 8.

Answer: B)
