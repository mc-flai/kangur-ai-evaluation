Reasoning:
Question 3 asks to find the minimum number of tiles that need to be changed so that no two adjacent tiles have the same color. The current tile arrangement has 9 tiles. The tiles are arranged in a 3x3 grid. Let's denote the colors as G for gray and W for white. The current arrangement can be written as:
G G W
G W G
W G G
We can re-arrange to
G W G
W G W
G W G
In the re-arranged grid no two adjacent tiles have the same color. To convert from the existing tile arrangements to the re-arranged tile arrangement, we can count how many tiles match their location and how many do not.
G G W -> G W G (2 changes)
G W G -> W G W (2 changes)
W G G -> G W G (2 changes)
Total changes = 2+2+2 = 6. This is not an efficient arrangement.
We can try a checkerboard-like pattern.
G W G
W G W
G W G
We can rearrange the existing to a checkerboard arrangement. We want to minimize changes to the existing grid.
Current:
G G W
G W G
W G G

Checkerboard:
G W G
W G W
G W G

Comparing the grids tile-by-tile:
(1,1) G G
(1,2) G W (change)
(1,3) W G (change)
(2,1) G W (change)
(2,2) W G (change)
(2,3) G W (change)
(3,1) W G (change)
(3,2) G W (change)
(3,3) G G
Total changes = 6

Checkerboard:
W G W
G W G
W G W
Current
G G W
G W G
W G G

Comparing the grids tile-by-tile:
(1,1) W G (change)
(1,2) G G (change)
(1,3) W W
(2,1) G G (change)
(2,2) W W
(2,3) G G (change)
(3,1) W W
(3,2) G G (change)
(3,3) W G (change)
Total changes = 6

Let's look for smaller alternatives:
We can try to keep the corner colors the same.
We can alternate the colors in the first row from G G W to G W G (2 changes)
In the 2nd row we alternate G W G to W G W (2 changes)
In the 3rd row we alternate W G G to G W G (2 changes)
Minimum number of changes possible must be greater than 2.
Let us start by assuming there is a solution with 1 change. This cannot give the required condition.
Let us try a solution with 2 changes.
If we change G to W in the 1st row, we get W G W. However, no changes can fix the 2nd and 3rd rows such that no tiles are the same color as their adjacent counterparts.

Consider changing 3 tiles. Start by switching first three tiles to W,G,W. W G W. Then alternate subsequent ones

After observation, we note that minimum number of flips needed is 3.
