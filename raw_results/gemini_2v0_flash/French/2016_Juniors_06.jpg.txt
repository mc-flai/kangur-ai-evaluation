Reasoning:
The question says that Lucas counts backward and writes numbers in the form: ..., 3, 2, 1, 0, 00, 000, 0000, ...
We need to find the result of 000 + 0000 in Lucas's notation.
000 in Lucas's notation corresponds to the number 2 in the usual notation.
0000 in Lucas's notation corresponds to the number 3 in the usual notation.
So, 000 + 0000 in Lucas's notation corresponds to 2 + 3 = 5 in the usual notation.
Since 0 is followed by two zeros, one zero, two zeros, three zeros, four zeros, five zeros..., then 5 is represented by six zeros.

Answer: C)
