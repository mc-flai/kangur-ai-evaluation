Reasoning:
The question asks which of the given functions has the most intersection points with the function f(x) = x.
A) g1(x) = x^2 intersects f(x) = x at x=0 and x=1, so 2 points.
B) g2(x) = x^3 intersects f(x) = x at x=-1, x=0, x=1, so 3 points.
C) g3(x) = x^4 intersects f(x) = x at x=0 and x=1, so 2 points.
D) g4(x) = -x^4 intersects f(x) = x at x=0, so 1 point.
E) g5(x) = -x intersects f(x) = x at x=0, so 1 point.
The function g2(x) = x^3 intersects f(x) = x at 3 points, which is more than any other option.

Answer: B)
