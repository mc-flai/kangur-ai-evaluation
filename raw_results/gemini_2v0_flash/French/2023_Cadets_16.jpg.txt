Reasoning:
The question states that Rita wrote three consecutive integers using symbols. The integers are: "square XX", "heart triangle triangle", "heart triangle square". We need to find the next integer.

Let's analyze the sequence. Since the integers are consecutive, we can deduce the following:
- "square" represents a digit.
- "XX" represents an integer
- "heart" represents a digit
- "triangle triangle" represents an integer
- "heart triangle square" represents an integer.

Since they are consecutive, "heart triangle square" comes after "heart triangle triangle", so "square" must be the next number after "triangle." Also, "heart triangle triangle" comes after "square XX". Therefore, "heart triangle triangle" is larger than "square XX".

Let's analyze the last digit. The last digit increments from "XX" to "triangle triangle" to "triangle square." If "square" comes after "triangle", then adding 1 to "heart triangle square" should produce "heart something something." Thus, the next consecutive integer should have the form "heart something something". Since "square", "XX", "triangle", and "heart" represent different digits, and the numbers are consecutive, we are looking for a case where incrementing the last number means that the ones digit increments and also leads to a carry-over, since "triangle" must increment to "square".

Since "square XX", "heart triangle triangle", and "heart triangle square" are consecutive integers, the integer after that would be formed by incrementing "square". Based on the options, we need to find which one of the options would make the sequence still make sense.
The sequence of last digits is XX, triangle triangle, triangle square. If we increase this by 1, we would get something of the form XX + 1 = triangle triangle, and triangle triangle + 1 = triangle square, etc.
The next digit has to change, so "square" + 1 should be a different number, which implies it has to rollover. The numbers in the given options are heart, triangle, square and X. Also notice that since the consecutive integers involve three digits.

The current sequence is Square XX, Heart Triangle Triangle, Heart Triangle Square.
The next in the sequence should be Heart Square.... Since the 'unit's digits' are 'XX', 'Triangle', 'Square', it must be that Square = XX + 2, and Triangle = XX + 1. The number after 'Square' in the unit's position must be XX (because 9+1 means a roll over). Hence we must have Heart Square XX. But 'XX' is not any of the remaining available digits.
Also note that square equals XX + 2. Let's use option A - Heart Heart XX.

A) ♥♥X - If that's true then we must have two hearts. If we increase the last value Square we must have that "Square+1" gives us XX again, implying that square = 9, and that XX = 0. If square =9, it suggests heart increments to the next digit. If we increase Heart Triangle Square, we must have to add one more, so that Square changes to XX, and we're rolling over.
We would have Heart Triangle Square to Heart Square XX. That suggests a change to heart and a return to XX in the unit's place.
The answer is then: Heart Heart XX.

The only viable one must therefore be A) ♥♥X

Reasoning:
The question states Rita wrote three consecutive integers using symbols for each digit:
1. square XX
2. heart triangle triangle
3. heart triangle square
We're asked to determine the next integer in the sequence
The unit's place digits, from sequence 1, 2, 3 are XX, triangle, square
It makes sense that the next number is A) heart heart XX

Answer: A)
