Reasoning: The problem states that the two cylindrical reservoirs have the same volume of water. One is upright, and the other is tilted so that the water level just reaches the highest point of its base. Also, the water level is the same for both. Let h be the height of the water in the upright cylinder. Then the volume of water in the upright cylinder is given by the area of the circular base times the height, which is πr^2h = π(1)^2h = πh. Since the tilted cylinder has the same volume of water, and the water level is the same, the water in the tilted cylinder fills exactly half of the cylinder. The volume of the entire tilted cylinder up to the level h is πh. Thus, the volume of water is half of this, which is (πh)/2. So we have πh = π.  Since the height of the water level is h, the volume is πh. So the answer is π. The height of the water level is 1. Volume is then π(1)^2(1) = π.
