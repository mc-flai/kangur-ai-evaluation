Reasoning: The four angles are located at four vertices of the cube. The lines defining the angles are segments in bold. Each of these angles are the angles of an equilateral triangle. An equilateral triangle has angles equal to 60 degrees. Thus, the sum of the four angles is 4 * 90 degrees = 360 degrees.
