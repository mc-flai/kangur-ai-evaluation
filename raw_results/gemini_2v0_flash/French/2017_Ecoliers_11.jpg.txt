Reasoning: Question 11 states that balloons are sold in packets of 5, 10, and 25. Marius wants to buy 70 balloons exactly, using the fewest number of packets possible.
We want to maximize the use of 25-balloon packets.
Two packets of 25 give 50 balloons. We need 20 more. Two packets of 10 will make up the additional 20.
Total packets will be 2 (25-balloons) + 2 (10-balloons) = 4 packets.
This is the fewest possible packets to get exactly 70 balloons.

Answer: B)
