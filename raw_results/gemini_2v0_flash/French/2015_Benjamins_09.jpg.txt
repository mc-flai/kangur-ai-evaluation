Reasoning:
Each small square has an area of 4 cm², which means each side of a square has a length of √4 = 2 cm.
Now, we count the number of sides of the squares that make up the thick black line.
Horizontal segments: 3 segments of 1 side each, so 3 * 1 = 3 sides
Vertical segments: 5 segments of 1 side each, so 5 * 1 = 5 sides
In total, there are 3 + 5 = 8 sides of squares. Since each side is 2cm, the total length of the thick black line is 8 * 2 = 16 cm.
