Reasoning:
The question says that F is a linear function, thus F(x) = ax + b, for constants a and b. F(2) = 1342. We want to find the value of F(3).
Assume the linear function is of the form F(x) = kx where k is some constant.
Then F(2) = 2k = 1342, which implies k = 671.
So F(x) = 671x and then F(3) = 671 * 3 = 2013.
Alternative approach.
Since F is linear, let F(x) = ax + b.
F(2) = 2a + b = 1342.
Then F(3) = 3a + b.
F(3) - F(2) = 3a + b - (2a + b) = a.
So F(3) = F(2) + a.
Without knowing a or b, we can only assume that F(x) = ax.
If we say that F(0) = 0 then b = 0.
2a = 1342 so a = 671.
Thus F(3) = 3a = 3(671) = 2013.
