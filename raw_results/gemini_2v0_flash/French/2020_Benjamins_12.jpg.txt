Reasoning: The large cube is made of 10 white cubes, 9 grey cubes and 8 black cubes, so it's made of 10+9+8 = 27 cubes. A cube with 27 small cubes is a 3x3x3 cube.
A) Appears to have alternating colors and it's not possible with this number of cubes.
B) Appears to have the top row and bottom row as white and grey, respectively. From what we can see it follows a pattern like this, but it's not guaranteed to follow. Also it may have a mix of other colors if the top row is white.
C) This option has the first layer as white, the second as gray, the third one appears to contain black ones. This is correct.
D) Has black squares, white squares and grey squares. But more black squares can be seen and less white squares.
E) Appears to have more grey than white.

Reasoning: The question states that Mathis has 10 white, 9 grey, and 8 black cubes.
Since the options are only showing the outside of the cubes and not inside, and the large cubes are 3x3x3 in each option. We can only see 3 sides.
Option C shows what we can see, two of white, one row grey and mixed colors. This is the best answer.

Answer: C)
