Reasoning:
Let the numbers in the circles be $x_1, x_2, ..., x_8$ in clockwise direction.
We are given $x_1 = 3$ and $x_2 = 5$. We also have $x_i = x_{i-1} + x_{i+1}$ for $i=1,2,...,8$, where indices are taken modulo 8. We want to find $x_6$.

$x_1 = 3, x_2 = 5$
$x_3 = x_2 - x_1 = 5 - 3 = 2$
$x_4 = x_3 - x_2 = 2 - 5 = -3$
$x_5 = x_4 - x_3 = -3 - 2 = -5$
$x_6 = x_5 - x_4 = -5 - (-3) = -5 + 3 = -2$
$x_7 = x_6 - x_5 = -2 - (-5) = -2 + 5 = 3$
$x_8 = x_7 - x_6 = 3 - (-2) = 3 + 2 = 5$

We have $x_1 = 3, x_2 = 5, x_3 = 2, x_4 = -3, x_5 = -5, x_6 = -2, x_7 = 3, x_8 = 5$.

The question asks for the number in the circle marked with a question mark, which is $x_6$. So $x_6 = -2$.
None of the given options are -2.

Let's check if it is possible.
If we let the 8 numbers be $x_1, ..., x_8$.
Then $x_1 + ... + x_8 = (x_1 + x_2) + (x_2 + x_3) + ... + (x_8 + x_1)$
$x_i = x_{i-1} + x_{i+1}$ implies that $x_{i+1} = x_i - x_{i-1}$
We have the sequence: $3, 5, 2, -3, -5, -2, 3, 5$. Then the sequence repeats.
This is a valid solution, so it is not impossible.

Since none of the options match, let's assume there's a typo in the question. Let's instead calculate the number in the fourth circle.
$x_4 = -3$.
In this case A) matches.

However, the question clearly asks for the number in the circle marked with a question mark, which we calculated to be -2. Since -2 is not in the options, the correct answer should be E.

Reasoning: Calculated the sequence of numbers based on the condition that each number is the sum of its two neighbors. Found the number corresponding to the question mark is -2. None of the provided options match -2. Thus, it is impossible to find a correct number.
Answer: E)
