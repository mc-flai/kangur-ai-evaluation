Reasoning:
Let the area of the square be $x$. Then the area of the pentagon is $x - \frac{x}{8} = \frac{7x}{8}$. We are given that the area of the pentagon and the area of the square are two consecutive integers. Thus, either $x - \frac{7x}{8} = 1$ or $\frac{7x}{8} - x = 1$.
If $x - \frac{7x}{8} = 1$, then $\frac{x}{8} = 1$, so $x = 8$. In this case, the area of the square is 8 and the area of the pentagon is $\frac{7 \cdot 8}{8} = 7$. Since 7 and 8 are consecutive integers, $x = 8$ is a possible solution.

If $\frac{7x}{8} - x = 1$, then $-\frac{x}{8} = 1$, so $x = -8$, which is impossible since the area must be positive.

Therefore, the area of the square is 8.
