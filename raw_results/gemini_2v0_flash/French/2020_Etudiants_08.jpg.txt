Reasoning:
The question states that $c$ dogs weigh $k$ kilograms, and $e$ elephants weigh the same as $m$ dogs. We want to find the weight of one elephant.
The weight of one dog is $k/c$ kg.
The weight of $m$ dogs is $m(k/c) = mk/c$ kg.
Since $e$ elephants weigh the same as $m$ dogs, $e$ elephants weigh $mk/c$ kg.
Therefore, the weight of one elephant is $(mk/c) / e = mk/(ce)$ kg.

Answer: D)
