Reasoning: I need to count the number of cubes in the figure that will have exactly 4 faces painted when the whole figure is submerged in paint. These are cubes that have two adjacent faces hidden inside the structure.
Looking at the figure, there are 8 such cubes: the two cubes in the middle row of the "H" shape. These are:
- The top left cube.
- The top right cube.
- The bottom left cube.
- The bottom right cube.
- And four cubes that are in the middle, and the bottom of those faces are connected to each other.

Answer: E)
