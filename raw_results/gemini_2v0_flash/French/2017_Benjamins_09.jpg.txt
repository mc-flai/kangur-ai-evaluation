Reasoning:
Let $p$ be the number of questions Pierre solves, and $m$ be the number of questions Marie solves. For every 2 questions Pierre solves, Marie solves 3. So $m = \frac{3}{2}p$.
Together they solve 50 questions. $p + m = 50$.
Substitute $m = \frac{3}{2}p$ into $p + m = 50$:
$p + \frac{3}{2}p = 50$
$\frac{2}{2}p + \frac{3}{2}p = 50$
$\frac{5}{2}p = 50$
$p = 50 \times \frac{2}{5} = 10 \times 2 = 20$
$m = 50 - p = 50 - 20 = 30$
Marie solves $m = 30$ questions, and Pierre solves $p = 20$ questions.
The difference is $m - p = 30 - 20 = 10$. Marie solved 10 more questions than Pierre.
