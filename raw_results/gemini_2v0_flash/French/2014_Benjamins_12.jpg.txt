Reasoning:
We are given that points P, Q, R, and S are aligned in that order. We are given the lengths PR = 15 cm, QS = 12 cm, and PS = 20 cm. We want to find the length of QR.
Since P, Q, R, and S are aligned in that order, we can write PS = PQ + QS. We are given PS = 20 cm and QS = 12 cm, so we have 20 = PQ + 12, which implies PQ = 20 - 12 = 8 cm.
Also, we can write PR = PQ + QR. We are given PR = 15 cm and we found PQ = 8 cm, so we have 15 = 8 + QR, which implies QR = 15 - 8 = 7 cm.
