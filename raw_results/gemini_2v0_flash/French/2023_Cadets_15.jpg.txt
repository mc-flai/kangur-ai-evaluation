Reasoning: The figure is formed by a combination of thin and thick rhombuses. We are asked to find the measure of the larger angle of a large rhombus. Observing the arrangement, we see that 5 of the larger angles of the thick rhombus seem to meet at a point. Thus, if we assume they meet at the center, then the large angle = 360 degrees / 3 = 120 degrees. Another way to look at the figure is to consider the smaller rhombuses forming a regular pentagon shape when we zoom in.

Reasoning:
If you were to look closely at the arrangement of the larger angles of the "gros" losange, the large rhombuses, you will notice that 3 of the vertices (the obtuse angle) meet at one point, not 5. Therefore, 360/3 = 120 degrees.

If you look at the way that the large angles fit together in the rosette figure, there are three obtuse angles in each vertex. Therefore, 360° / 3 ≈ 120°

Reasoning: Notice that the rosette shape has pentagons and larger angle vertices touching a point, which can give an approximate angle of 108 degrees.

Reasoning: The "thin" rhombuses have a small interior angle of 36 degrees (180/5) and a large interior angle 144 degrees. The "gross" rhombuses, which means 'larger', must have an interior angle related to those "thin" rhombuses.

Reasoning: Three large angles of the large rhombuses meet at one vertex. Therefore, the largest angle is 360/3 = 120 degrees.
