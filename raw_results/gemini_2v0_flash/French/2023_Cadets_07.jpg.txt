Reasoning: Let the four unknown numbers at the vertices of the rhombus be a, b, c, and d, starting from the top-left vertex and proceeding clockwise. We are given the sums of the numbers on each side:
a + b = 8
b + c = 9
c + d = 13
We need to find a + d.
We can express a + d as follows:
a + d = (a + b) + (c + d) - (b + c)
Substituting the given values:
a + d = 8 + 13 - 9
a + d = 21 - 9
a + d = 12
Therefore, the sum of the numbers on the fourth side is 12.

Answer: B)
