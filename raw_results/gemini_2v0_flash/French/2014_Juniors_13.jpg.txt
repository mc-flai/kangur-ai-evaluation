Reasoning:
The question asks in which expression (b+1) cannot be factored. We will examine each expression.
A) 2b + 2 = 2(b + 1).
B) b^2 - 1 = (b - 1)(b + 1).
C) b^2 + b = b(b + 1).
D) -1 - b = -(1 + b) = -(b + 1).
E) b^2 + 1. This expression cannot be factored using real numbers and cannot have (b+1) as a factor.

Answer: E)
