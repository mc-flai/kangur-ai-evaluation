Reasoning: The question asks which tile pattern, when used to tile a plane, will NOT form a closed loop. Visualizing repeating the pattern, we see that A, B, D, and E will create repeating closed loops. In C, there are two straight lines on the top right side, so when tiling this pattern, the lines will never connect, creating no closed loops.
Answer: C)
