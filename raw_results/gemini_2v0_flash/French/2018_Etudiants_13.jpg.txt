Reasoning: The graph shows that the height of the water increases rapidly at the beginning and then slows down as time goes on. This means that the vase is wider at the top than at the bottom.
A) A cylinder would have a constant rate of height increase.
B) This vase has an hourglass shape; therefore, the rate of height increase will decrease and then increase, and then decrease again.
C) This vase has a large bottom and then a thin neck. This could work.
D) A cone would have the water rising quickly when near the bottom and then more and more slowly as the cone gets wider and wider. This shape's water height increase would be a decreasing function.
E) This is a sphere with a hole on top.

Since the graph shows a steep increase in water height initially, followed by a gradually decreasing rate, the vase must be narrower at the bottom and wider at the top. Shape D is the only shape that satisfies these constraints.

Answer: D)
