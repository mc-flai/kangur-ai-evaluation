Reasoning:
We are given three views of a triangular pyramid made of 10 balls. We know that there are two balls for each letter A, B, C, D, and E. We need to find the letter on the ball marked with a question mark.

Let's analyze the three views:
1. View 1: A on top, B and C in the middle, ? and E on the bottom.
2. View 2: A on top, E and B in the middle, D and B and D on the bottom.
3. View 3: A on top, C and E in the middle, E and C and D on the bottom.

From View 1, we know that the bottom row contains letters from the set {A, B, C, D, E}.
From View 2, the bottom row contains D, B, and D.
From View 3, the bottom row contains E, C, and D.

The letters on the bottom row are arranged differently in each view. We are looking for the ball in the bottom row that is next to the E in the first view.

We know each view has 4 balls at the bottom layer, therefore it must be a triangular pyramid, with layer sizes of 1, 2, 3, and 4 balls.
In the first view, the bottom layer shows '? E'.
In the second view, the bottom layer shows 'D B D'.
In the third view, the bottom layer shows 'E C D'.

We can look at the letters present in each view.
View 1 has A, B, C, ?, E. This uses up 5 distinct letters.
View 2 has A, E, B, D.
View 3 has A, C, E, D.
We know there are two of each letter A, B, C, D, E.
Combining the three views, we have A, B, C, D, E. So the only possibilities for the question mark are A, B, C, D, or E.

Let us examine what we know from the bottom row. View 1: ? E; View 2: D B D; View 3: E C D.
We have the following letters in each view:
View 1: A, B, C, ?, E (can contain D)
View 2: A, B, D, E (can contain C)
View 3: A, C, D, E (can contain B)

Each view shows one side of the pyramid. So we need to find a consistent letter to place in the '?'.
Looking at the bottom row, we have ? E, D B D, and E C D. Since each letter appears twice, if ? is D, then we will have 3 Ds which is not allowed. If ? is A, then we are unable to form consistent letters.

By carefully examining the arrangements, the question mark should be 'D'.
So, we have the first layer as A, the second layer as B,C, and the third layer as D, E, and D, and the last layer as 'D E'.

Reasoning: By analyzing the three views of the triangular pyramid and considering the constraint that there are exactly two balls of each letter (A, B, C, D, E), we can deduce the letter on the ball marked with a question mark. By examining the adjacent views, it can be concluded that D is the most compatible response.

Answer: D)
