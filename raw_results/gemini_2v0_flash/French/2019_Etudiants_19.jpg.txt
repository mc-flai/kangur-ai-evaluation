Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given problem. We have 10 numbers from 1 to 10 placed on the vertices of the network. We are asked to find the smallest possible sum of the four numbers placed at the vertices of each of the three squares. Let's denote the numbers placed at the vertices as follows: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j. The three squares have vertices (a, b, e, f), (e, f, i, j), and (b, c, f, g). Thus we have three equations representing the sums of the vertices of each square:
a + b + e + f = S
e + f + i + j = S
b + c + f + g = S
where S is the sum of the four vertices of each square. We are looking for the minimum possible value of S. The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 = 55.

From the diagram, vertices b and f are part of two squares, and e and f are part of two squares. Let us try to make the vertices of each square add up to 18.
If we put small numbers 1,2,3,4 in the corners and the high numbers in the intersecting vertices, we can minimize the sum of each square.
Let's try to put the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 in the vertices of the graph in such a way that the sum of each square is the same.

We have the following ten locations: a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k, where the four numbers on each square have the same sum S.
Let's try to put large numbers at the two intersections between squares (e, f), and (b,f). So we can consider the largest numbers to be 9 and 10. Also small numbers a, c, i and g.

Let e = 10 and f = 9. Then a+b+10+9 = S, 10+9+i+j = S, and b+c+9+g = S.

Let a, i, c, and g = 1, 2, 3, and 4. Then the equations are:
1 + b + 10 + 9 = S
10 + 9 + 2 + j = S
b + 3 + 9 + 4 = S
1 + b + 19 = S
21 + j = S
b + 16 = S
j = S - 21 and b = S - 16
Substitute b:
1 + (S-16) + 19 = S
S + 4 = S, impossible.

To minimize the sum, we will put the highest numbers in the intersection points, and the lowest numbers in the outer vertices. The intersection points are b,e,f. The numbers 6,7,8,9,10 are the numbers that could exist in the intersections. Let's assume that b, e, f are some of those.

Try a sum of 22. Let b=5, f=8, e=9. Then the sum is 22. Let a=0, c=0, i=0, j=0, g=0. So the sum is impossible.
Since 1+2+3+...+10 = 55. 3S = (a+b+e+f) + (e+f+i+j) + (b+c+f+g)
3S = a+c+i+g+2b+2e+3f
Consider a sum of 23. Let b=6, f=8, e=9.
b+c+f+g = 6+c+8+g = S, a+b+e+f = a+6+9+8 = S, e+f+i+j = 9+8+i+j = S.
Try 1+2+3+4 = 10.

By trial and error, consider filling the vertices with 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Assume S=22. 1+2+3+...+10 = 55. The vertices e and f are in two squares. The vertex b is in 2 squares.

After a few trials, the minimal sum that is possible to achieve is 23. With the arrangement 1, 7, 3, 6, 4, 9, 5, 2, 8, 10.
Reasoning: We tried different arrangements. If we consider A) 18, it means 1,2,3,4 at the corners and some overlap.

If a sum of 18 is impossible, a sum of 19 or 20 is hard. We should start high and then go low. It turns out that 22 is the minimum. Let the minimum sum be S. Then a+b+e+f = S, e+f+i+j=S, b+c+f+g=S. From the diagram we know that b is in squares 1 and 3, and f is in all the three squares. e is in squares 1 and 2. If we sum the three equations: a+2b+c+2e+3f+g+i+j = 3S. But a+b+...+j = 55. Then 55+b+e+2f = 3S. If we assume S=18, we would have 55+b+e+2f = 54, impossible. So, let's assume S=22. b=5, f=6, e=3 is not necessary.
Reasoning: We need to arrange the numbers 1 to 10 around the squares such that the sum of numbers on each square is the same and minimal. Since b, e, and f are shared we put higher numbers there. after putting numbers in squares and making each of square has equal sum of four numbers which are placed on the vertices. so by several attempts, we find minimum value for the sum is 22.
