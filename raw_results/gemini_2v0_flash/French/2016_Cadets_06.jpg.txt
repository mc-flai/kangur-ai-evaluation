Reasoning:
The question asks how many swaps (interversions) between knives and forks are necessary to ensure that each of the four settings has the knife on the right and the fork on the left of the plate.
Looking at the image, two settings are correct (top left, bottom right). The top right setting has them reversed. The bottom left setting has them reversed as well. So to fix the placements, we only need to swap the cutlery on the upper right with the correct order (1 swap) and the cutlery on the bottom left with the correct order (1 swap). So that makes a total of 2 swaps.

Answer: B)
