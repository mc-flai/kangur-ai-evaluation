Reasoning:
The question asks for the *maximum* number of black squares that can be seen when the three transparent sheets are superimposed.
Each sheet has 3 black squares, so the maximum possible is 3 * 3 = 9. Let's try to achieve 9.
Sheet 1: blocks (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)
Sheet 2: blocks (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)
Sheet 3: blocks (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)
If we rotate the second and third sheets 90 degrees clockwise, we get:
Sheet 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)
Sheet 2 rotated: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)
Sheet 3 rotated: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)

Now let's keep Sheet 1 and rotate the other two sheets. Place sheet 1 as given.
Sheet 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)
Sheet 2 rotated 90 degrees clockwise: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)
Sheet 3 rotated 90 degrees anticlockwise: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)

Let's consider the case where we overlay all squares. Sheet 1 and Sheet 2 have only 1 square in common.
There are 9 squares, so theoretically, all 9 could be black. To maximize, we need to ensure that the black squares from different sheets cover distinct squares as much as possible.

By placing each sheet in the same orientation, we get the initial arrangement:
Sheet 1: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1)
Sheet 2: (1,1), (2,3), (3,2)
Sheet 3: (1,2), (2,3), (3,3)

Combining:
(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3) - 6 squares. But we want to maximize, so let's investigate.

If we rotate the first and second sheets by 180 degrees.
Sheet 1: (3,3), (3,2), (2,3)
Sheet 2: (3,3), (2,1), (1,2)
Sheet 3: (1,2), (2,3), (3,3)
Squares (1,2), (2,3) and (3,3) appear twice in the above combinations. So we get:
(1,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3), (2,1).
Let's try to make each of the nine squares black. We know the minimum is 5, based on just adding the sheets together.

After trying various combinations, it seems difficult to get all 9 squares black.
However, we can obtain 7 black squares.

Reasoning: By visualizing different rotations and arrangements, we can see that it is possible to cover more than 6 squares but difficult to achieve all 9.
Consider that there is only a limited number of squares.
We need to estimate and consider the cases provided. In order for a square to be white after we overlay all three sheets, all of the three sheets must be clear.
Since each sheet has 3 black squares and there are 9 squares total, this looks difficult to make 8 or 9.
7 is the most plausible answer out of the given conditions.
