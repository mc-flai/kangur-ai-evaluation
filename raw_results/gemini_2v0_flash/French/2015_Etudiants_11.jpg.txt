Reasoning:
We are given that $a, b, c, d, e$ are distinct positive integers.
Also, we have the relations $\frac{c}{e} = b$, $a+b = d$, and $e-d = a$.
From $\frac{c}{e} = b$, we can write $c = be$. Since $b$ and $e$ are positive integers, we know that $c$ is also a positive integer.
From $e-d = a$, we have $e = a+d$. Since $a$ and $d$ are positive integers, we know that $e > d$.
From $a+b = d$, we have $d > a$ and $d > b$.
Therefore, $e > d > a$ and $e > d > b$.
Since $c = be$, and all variables are positive integers, $c > e$ if $b > 1$, and $c < e$ if $b < 1$.
We have $a+b = d$ and $e-d = a$, so $e = d+a = a+b+a = 2a+b$.
Since $c = be$, we have $e > \frac{c}{b}$. If $b=1$, then $c=e$. Since all integers are distinct, $b \neq 1$.
Since $e = 2a+b > a, e > b$.
If $e=1$, $a$ and $d$ are not positive. Thus, $e>1$. Then $c = be > b$.
If $b=1$, then $c=e$, which is not possible.
If $b=2$, then $c=2e$, which is the largest. $c > e > d > a,b$.
If $b=3$, then $c=3e$.

We have $e = a+d = a+(a+b) = 2a+b$.
$d=a+b$.
$c=be=b(2a+b) = 2ab+b^2$.
We can see that if $2ab+b^2>e$, then $c$ is the largest.
For example, if $a=1$ and $b=2$, then $d=3$ and $e=4$. $c=be = 2(4)=8$.
So the order is $a=1$, $b=2$, $d=3$, $e=4$, $c=8$.
In this case, $c$ is the largest integer.
Let $a=2$ and $b=1$, then $d=3$ and $e=a+d=2+3=5$, $c=be=1*5=5$, which is not distinct from $e$.
In general, let $e=5$. If $b=1$, $c=5=e$. If $a=1$, $b=2$, then $d=3$, $e=a+d=1+3=4$, contradiction.
If $b=3$, $a=1$, $e-d=1$, $a+b=d=4$, $e=5$. $c/e = b = 3$, so $c=3*5=15$. In this case, $c$ is the largest.
Since $d=a+b$, and $e=d+a$, $e = a+b+a = 2a+b$. Then $c = be = b(2a+b) = 2ab+b^2$.
We want to find the largest of $a, b, 2ab+b^2, a+b, 2a+b$.

Consider $c$. If $b > a$, we have $2ab+b^2 > 2a^2 + b^2 > 2a > a$ and $2ab+b^2>2b>b$.
When $b=1$, $c=2a+1 = e$. We need $b>1$, therefore. If $a=1, b=2$, then $d=3, e=4, c=8$. Here c is the largest.
If $a=2, b=1$, we get $d=3, e=4+1=5$, $c=b*e=5$, not distinct from e.
$c$ is probably the largest value.
