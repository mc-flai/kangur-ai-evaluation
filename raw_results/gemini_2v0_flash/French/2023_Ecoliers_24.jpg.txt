Reasoning:
Since one person has the correct image, and the other four have 4 correct and 1 incorrect, the correct one will have multiple people making the same error. I will compare the images to look for overlapping errors.

Comparing Anna and Emma:
Anna and Emma both have the top right square filled.
Anna has the square above the bottom-left square filled
Emma has the square to the right of the top-left square filled.
Anna has the square to the left of the top-left square filled.
Emma has the bottom-left square filled.

Comparing Bea to Anna and Emma:
Bea has the top-right square filled, same as Anna and Emma
Bea also has the square to the right of the top-left square filled. (same as Emma)
Bea has a square in the middle.
Bea has the bottom-right square filled.
Bea has the bottom-left square filled, same as Emma.

Comparing Clara and Doria to the other three
Clara and Doria do not have the top-right filled so are very unlikely to be the correct answer.
Since Bea and Emma have 2 matches of filled spots (top-right and bottom-left), it is likely one of these is the correct one. The person making a mistake is the one without the central square filled (Emma). So Bea is the correct answer.

Answer: B)
