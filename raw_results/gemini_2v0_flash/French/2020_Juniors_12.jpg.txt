Reasoning: The problem states that when traveling from Maville to Chétoy, you first encounter the sign on the left, and later the sign on the right. The sign on the left shows that Issy is 1 km away and Maville is 3 km away. Thus, the distance from Maville to Issy is 3-1=2km. The sign on the right shows that Maville is 6 km away and Chétoy is 6 km away. Since we are on the way from Maville to Chétoy and we see the sign with Maville = 6km, this indicates that the place of the right signpost is a distance of 6km from Maville. From Maville to Issy, we have 2km (3-1=2). So, the distance of the right signpost from Issy must be 6-2=4 km. Therefore, the distance from Issy to the right signpost is 4 km. Therefore, the broken distance is 4 km.
