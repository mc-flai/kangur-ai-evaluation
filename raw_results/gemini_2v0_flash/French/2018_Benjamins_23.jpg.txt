Reasoning:
Let the numbers in the outer circles be a, b, c, d, e, f and the number in the center circle be x.
The numbers to be placed are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
The sum of the numbers is 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 42.
The condition given is that the three sums of three numbers aligned are equal. Let that sum be S.
S = a + x + d = b + x + e = c + x + f.
Since the three sums are equal, the sum of these three sums is 3S = a + b + c + d + e + f + 3x.
Also, a + b + c + d + e + f = 42 - x.
So, 3S = 42 - x + 3x = 42 + 2x.
Since 3S is divisible by 3, 42 + 2x must be divisible by 3.
42 is divisible by 3, so 2x must also be divisible by 3. This means x must be divisible by 3.
From the given numbers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, the numbers divisible by 3 are 3, 6 and 9.
If x = 3, 3S = 42 + 2(3) = 48. S = 16. The other numbers are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. We can arrange them such that the sum is 16.
If x = 6, 3S = 42 + 2(6) = 54. S = 18. The other numbers are 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9. We can arrange them such that the sum is 18.
If x = 9, 3S = 42 + 2(9) = 60. S = 20. The other numbers are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. We can arrange them such that the sum is 20.
The possible numbers that can be placed in the center are 3, 6 and 9.
The question asks for the sum of the numbers that can be placed in the central circle. The sum is 3 + 6 + 9 = 18.

Answer: E)
Reasoning: We determine the numbers that can be placed in the center are 3, 6, and 9, whose sum is 18.
Answer: E)
Reasoning: Let x be the number in the center. The numbers to be placed are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
Let S be the sum of numbers in each line. We have three such lines. Then, 3S is the sum of all the numbers plus twice the number in the center circle.
3S = (3+4+5+6+7+8+9) + 2x = 42 + 2x. Since the LHS is divisible by 3, the RHS must also be divisible by 3.
42 is divisible by 3, so 2x must be divisible by 3, implying x must be divisible by 3. Thus x can be 3, 6 or 9.
If x = 3, then 3S = 42 + 6 = 48, so S = 16. Remaining numbers are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. We can arrange them.
If x = 6, then 3S = 42 + 12 = 54, so S = 18. Remaining numbers are 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9. We can arrange them.
If x = 9, then 3S = 42 + 18 = 60, so S = 20. Remaining numbers are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. We can arrange them.
So, the sum of the numbers that can be placed in the center is 3 + 6 + 9 = 18.
Answer: E)
Reasoning: The question asks for the sum of all numbers that can occupy the center.
We derived that only numbers divisible by 3 can be placed in the center.
That means only 3, 6 and 9 are possible candidates.
3 + 6 + 9 = 18
Answer: E)
Reasoning: Let 'x' be the number in the center. The sum of all the numbers (3 to 9) is 42. Since all the sums of the three lines are the same, let the sum be S. Therefore, 3S = (sum of all numbers) + 2x = 42 + 2x. This means that 3S = 42 + 2x. Since the left-hand side (3S) is divisible by 3, the right-hand side (42 + 2x) must also be divisible by 3. Since 42 is divisible by 3, 2x must also be divisible by 3. Therefore, x must be divisible by 3. The multiples of 3 available are 3, 6 and 9. We need to find the sum of the numbers which can be in the center.
3 + 6 + 9 = 18.
Answer: E)
Reasoning: The question asks for the sum of all the possible numbers that can be placed in the central circle. We know from previous steps that x must be divisible by 3 and can therefore be 3, 6 or 9. 3+6+9 = 18.
Answer: E)
Reasoning: As determined in previous steps the possible values for the center number are 3, 6 and 9. The question asks for the sum of these, so 3+6+9=18.
Answer: E)
Reasoning: We have shown the central number can only be 3, 6, or 9. The question asks the sum of the numbers that can be placed in the central circle, therefore we calculate 3 + 6 + 9 = 18.
Answer: E)
Reasoning: The numbers that can be in the center are 3, 6, and 9. Therefore, the sum is 3+6+9 = 18.
Answer: E)
Reasoning: As worked out earlier, the possible values for the centre circle are 3, 6 and 9. Summing them yields 18.
Answer: E)
Reasoning: From the previous reasoning steps, we determined that only the numbers 3, 6, and 9 can be placed in the central circle. The sum is 3 + 6 + 9 = 18.
Answer: E)
Reasoning: From the previous steps, we know the possible numbers that can be placed in the center circle are 3, 6, and 9. The sum of these numbers is 3+6+9 = 18.
