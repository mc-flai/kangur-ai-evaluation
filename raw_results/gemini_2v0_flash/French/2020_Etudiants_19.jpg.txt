Reasoning:
Let's analyze the sequence to find a pattern of even and odd numbers.
u1 = 1 (odd)
u2 = 3 (odd)
u3 = u1 + u2 = 1 + 3 = 4 (even)
u4 = u2 + u3 = 3 + 4 = 7 (odd)
u5 = u3 + u4 = 4 + 7 = 11 (odd)
u6 = u4 + u5 = 7 + 11 = 18 (even)
u7 = u5 + u6 = 11 + 18 = 29 (odd)
u8 = u6 + u7 = 18 + 29 = 47 (odd)
u9 = u7 + u8 = 29 + 47 = 76 (even)
u10 = u8 + u9 = 47 + 76 = 123 (odd)
u11 = u9 + u10 = 76 + 123 = 199 (odd)
u12 = u10 + u11 = 123 + 199 = 322 (even)

The sequence of parities is: odd, odd, even, odd, odd, even, odd, odd, even, odd, odd, even...
The pattern repeats every 3 terms: odd, odd, even.
The number of full cycles in 2020 terms is 2020 / 3 = 673.333...
So there are 673 complete cycles of (odd, odd, even).
In each cycle, there is 1 even number.
So there are 673 * 1 = 673 even numbers in the first 673 * 3 = 2019 terms.
The 2020th term will have the same parity as the 1st term since 2020 mod 3 is 1. Thus, it's odd.
Therefore, there are 673 even numbers in the first 2020 terms.
