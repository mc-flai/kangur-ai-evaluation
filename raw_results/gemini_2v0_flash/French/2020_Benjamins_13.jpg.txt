Reasoning: The question asks which path from point X to the center is the shortest. We can visually compare the paths. A, C, and E all have one straight line segment and one curved segment on the outer most ring, but C is the closest to the center point. B and D have smaller curved segment and a longer vertical distance. Compared to path C, B and D also include two straight line segments to reach the end point, thus making C the shortest distance in total.

Answer: C)
