Reasoning:
The question asks us to find three single-digit numbers that multiply to 135. Then, we need to add those three numbers together and choose the correct sum from the given options.
We can find the prime factorization of 135: 135 = 3 * 45 = 3 * 3 * 15 = 3 * 3 * 3 * 5.
So, the three single-digit numbers are 3, 3, and 5.
Since 3 * 3 * 15 = 3 * 5 * 9 and 3 * 5 * 9 = 135, the numbers are 3, 5 and 9.
Now, we add these three numbers: 3 + 5 + 9 = 17.
So, the correct answer is 17.
