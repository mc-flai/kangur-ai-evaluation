Reasoning: The question provides two conditional statements:
1. If Alex doesn't wear a hat, then Bob wears one.
2. If Bob doesn't wear a hat, then Clément wears one.

We are told that Bob doesn't wear a hat today. According to the second statement, this means that Clément wears a hat. The question doesn't say whether Alex is wearing one, so we cannot be sure who else is wearing a hat.
The only person we can definitively say is wearing a hat is Clément.

Answer: C)
