Reasoning: The question asks which river shape would result in the shortest bridge having varying lengths, depending on where the bridge is built.
A) The shortest distance between two sides will always have the same length.
B) If the river is straight, no matter what part of the bank you choose the distance will always be the same.
C) The shortest distance between two sides will always have the same length.
D) The shortest distance between two sides will always have the same length.
E) The shortest distance between two sides will always have the same length.

Therefore, all of the figures, A, C, D, and E will always have the same distance.

The only option that gives the shortest distance between two points, which changes, is B.

Answer: B)
