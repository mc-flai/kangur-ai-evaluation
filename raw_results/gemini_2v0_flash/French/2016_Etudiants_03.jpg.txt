Reasoning:
Question 3 states that Manon gets 2 kg of dried figs from 10 kg of fresh figs. The question asks how many kg of fresh figs are needed to obtain 5 kg of dried figs.
We can set up a proportion:
(kg of fresh figs) / (kg of dried figs) = 10 / 2
Let x be the kg of fresh figs needed for 5 kg of dried figs. Then:
x / 5 = 10 / 2
x = 5 * (10/2)
x = 5 * 5
x = 25
So, 25 kg of fresh figs are needed to obtain 5 kg of dried figs.
