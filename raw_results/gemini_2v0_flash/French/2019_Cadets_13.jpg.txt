Reasoning:
We need to find the pattern that cannot be formed by combining the two given shapes. Let's analyze each option:
A) By rotating the first shape by 90 degrees counterclockwise and placing it in the top right, we can complete this pattern.
B) By rotating the first shape by 90 degrees clockwise and placing it in the top right, we can complete this pattern.
C) By rotating the first shape by 180 degrees and placing it in the top right, we can complete this pattern.
D) There is no way to arrange the two given shapes to form pattern D.
E) By rotating the first shape by 270 degrees and placing it in the bottom left, we can complete this pattern.
