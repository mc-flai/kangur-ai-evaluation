Reasoning: The product of the 10 digits of an integer is 15. We need to find the sum of the digits. Since 15 = 3 * 5 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1, we have two non-one digits 3 and 5. So, the sum of the digits is 3 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 + 5 + 8*1 = 8 + 8 = 16.
So, the sum of the digits is 16.
