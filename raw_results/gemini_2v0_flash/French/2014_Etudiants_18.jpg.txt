Reasoning:
We are given the function f(x) = ax + b, where f: R -> R.
We also have two equations:
f(f(1)) = 21
f(f(0)) = 5

Let's evaluate f(1) and f(0):
f(1) = a(1) + b = a + b
f(0) = a(0) + b = b

Now we can substitute these into the given equations:
f(f(1)) = f(a+b) = a(a+b) + b = a^2 + ab + b = 21
f(f(0)) = f(b) = a(b) + b = ab + b = 5

We now have a system of two equations:
1) a^2 + ab + b = 21
2) ab + b = 5

Substitute equation (2) into equation (1):
a^2 + 5 = 21
a^2 = 21 - 5
a^2 = 16
a = +/- 4

Since the function f(x) is increasing, a must be positive. Therefore, a = 4.
