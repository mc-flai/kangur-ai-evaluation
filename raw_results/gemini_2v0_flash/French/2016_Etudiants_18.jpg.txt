Reasoning: The question asks which of the given numbers cannot be the sum of three 3-digit numbers formed by using the digits 1 to 9 exactly once. The smallest possible sum would be 123 + 456 + 789 = 1368. The largest possible sum would be 987 + 654 + 321 = 1962. Therefore, we need to check if the given values fall between this range, if not then, that could be an answer.

A) 1500: Possible
B) 1512: Possible
C) 1521: Possible
D) 1575: Possible
E) 2016: This is outside the range.

Reasoning: The smallest possible sum of three three-digit numbers using digits 1 to 9 exactly once is 123 + 456 + 789 = 1368. The largest possible sum is 987 + 654 + 321 = 1962. Among the given choices, 2016 is larger than 1962, so it can't be the sum of the three numbers.

Answer: E)
