Reasoning:
Let the perimeter of rectangle KLMN be P(KLMN) = 30 cm.
Let the sum of the perimeters of the three small rectangles be S = 20 cm.
We are asked to find the length of the thick line.
The thick line consists of the perimeter of rectangle KLMN plus the parts of the small rectangles that are added to the perimeter.
Let the lengths of the sides of the rectangle at K that are added to KLMN be x and y. Its perimeter is 2(x+y). We are adding x and y each, so we add x+y to the sides KL and KN.
Similarly, for the rectangle at L, we add a length and width (say, u and v, its perimeter is 2(u+v)), so we add u+v to the sides KL and LM.
For the rectangle at N, we add a length and width (say, a and b, its perimeter is 2(a+b)), so we add a+b to the sides KN and NM.
The sum of the perimeters of these three rectangles is 2(x+y) + 2(u+v) + 2(a+b) = 20 cm, which simplifies to x+y+u+v+a+b = 10 cm.
The total length of the thick line is the perimeter of KLMN + (x+y) + (u+v) + (a+b) = 30 cm + 10 cm = 40 cm.
