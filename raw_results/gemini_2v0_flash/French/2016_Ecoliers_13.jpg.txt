Reasoning: The mouse wants to reach the cheese without going twice in the same path. We can analyze the paths:
1. Top path - Top - Top
2. Top path - Top - Bottom
3. Top path - Bottom - Top
4. Top path - Bottom - Bottom
5. Bottom path - Top - Top
6. Bottom path - Top - Bottom
7. Bottom path - Bottom - Top
8. Bottom path - Bottom - Bottom
However, each path can be simplified, for example 1 and 5 are the same path (Top - Top - Top). In addition, it is important to note that between each path, there are connections at the top and at the bottom, which increases the combinations. Let's carefully count each possible path:

1. Upper path - straight - upper path (Top-Top-Top)
2. Upper path - straight - lower path (Top-Top-Bottom)
3. Upper path - crossed - upper path (Top-Bottom-Top)
4. Upper path - crossed - lower path (Top-Bottom-Bottom)
5. Lower path - straight - upper path (Bottom-Top-Top)
6. Lower path - straight - lower path (Bottom-Top-Bottom)
7. Lower path - crossed - upper path (Bottom-Bottom-Top)
8. Lower path - crossed - lower path (Bottom-Bottom-Bottom)
We need to remove duplicated paths. Specifically:
- Path 1 = Top - Top - Top
- Path 2 = Top - Top - Bottom
- Path 3 = Top - Bottom - Top
- Path 4 = Top - Bottom - Bottom
- Path 5 = Bottom - Top - Top
- Path 6 = Bottom - Top - Bottom
- Path 7 = Bottom - Bottom - Top
- Path 8 = Bottom - Bottom - Bottom
Let's trace these paths on the diagram, and count them without repeats:
1. Upper, straight, upper
2. Upper, straight, lower
3. Upper, crossed, upper
4. Upper, crossed, lower
5. Lower, straight, upper
6. Lower, straight, lower

We can simplify the paths to:
1. Top - Straight - Top
2. Top - Straight - Bottom
3. Top - Cross - Top
4. Top - Cross - Bottom
5. Bottom - Straight - Top
6. Bottom - Straight - Bottom
But this is not correct. Let us check systematically, noting down each path to avoid repetition. We can call the junction in the middle "M" for middle, U for Upper, and L for Lower.
- U, straight M, U, to cheese
- U, straight M, L, to cheese
- U, crossed M, U, to cheese
- U, crossed M, L, to cheese
- L, straight M, U, to cheese
- L, straight M, L, to cheese

So we have 6 paths in total.
