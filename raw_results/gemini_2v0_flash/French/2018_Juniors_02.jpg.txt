Reasoning:
The question asks for the minimum number of children in a family where each child has at least two brothers and one sister.
Let 'b' be the number of boys and 'g' be the number of girls.
Each boy has at least two brothers, which means b >= 3.
Each girl has at least one sister, which means g >= 2.
Therefore, the minimum number of children is b + g = 3 + 2 = 5.
