Reasoning: To minimize the number, we want as few digits as possible. We achieve this by using as many 9's as possible. 2019 / 9 = 224 with a remainder of 3. Thus, the number will consist of 224 nines and a 3. To minimize the number, we place the 3 in the leftmost digit, followed by the 224 nines. Therefore, the leftmost digit is 3.
Answer: B)
