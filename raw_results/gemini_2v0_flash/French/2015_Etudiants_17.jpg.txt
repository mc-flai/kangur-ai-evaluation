Reasoning:
The problem asks which of the axes a, b, c, or d is the y-axis (axis of ordinates).
From the image, it appears that axis 'a' is the y-axis. Also, axis 'c' seems to be the x-axis. The equation given describes a curve in the coordinate plane. The problem wants to know which line is the y-axis. By visual inspection, the line labeled 'a' is the y-axis, and the line labeled 'c' is the x-axis.

Answer: A)
