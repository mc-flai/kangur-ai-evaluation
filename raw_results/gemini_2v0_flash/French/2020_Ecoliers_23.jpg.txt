Reasoning: The numbers 1 to 8 are hidden behind shapes.
The sum of the 4 triangle numbers is 10.
The sum of the 3 square numbers is 20.
The sum of all the numbers from 1 to 8 is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 36
There are 4 triangles, 3 squares, and 1 circle. So there are 8 numbers.
Let the sum of the triangle numbers be T, the sum of the square numbers be S, and the circle number be C.
T = 10
S = 20
T + S + C = 36
10 + 20 + C = 36
30 + C = 36
C = 36 - 30
C = 6

Answer: D)
