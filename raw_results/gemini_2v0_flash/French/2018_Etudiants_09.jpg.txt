Reasoning:
Let the dimensions of the rectangular brick be $x, y, z$.
Then, the areas of the faces are given by $S = xy, T = xz, U = yz$.
The volume of the brick is $V = xyz$.
We want to find an expression for $V$ in terms of $S, T, U$.
We have $STU = (xy)(xz)(yz) = x^2y^2z^2 = (xyz)^2 = V^2$.
Therefore, $V = \sqrt{STU}$.

Answer: B)
