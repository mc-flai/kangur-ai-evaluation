Reasoning:
The problem states that one ice cream cone costs 1 euro. There is a promotion for 6 cones for 5 euros. The question asks how many cones can be purchased with 36 euros.

First, find out how many sets of 6 cones can be purchased with 36 euros.
36 / 5 = 7.2
Since you can only buy whole sets, you can buy 7 sets of 6 cones.
7 * 6 = 42 cones.
This costs 7 * 5 = 35 euros.
You have 36 - 35 = 1 euro remaining.
With the remaining 1 euro, you can buy one more cone.
Therefore, the total number of cones you can buy is 42 + 1 = 43.
