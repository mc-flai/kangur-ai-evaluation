Reasoning:
The question asks which two houses use exactly the same shapes.
House 1 uses triangles and a rectangle.
House 2 uses a rectangle and a smaller house.
House 3 uses triangles and a rectangle.
House 4 uses a square and a rectangle.
House 5 uses a square and a rectangle.

House 3 and house 5 looks most alike, let's check:
House 3: Triangle for roof, Rectangle for door.
House 5: Square for roof, rectangle for door.
Therefore they are not the same.

House 3 and House 4 are NOT the same.
House 3: Triangle for roof, Rectangle for door.
House 4: Square for roof, rectangle for door.
Therefore they are not the same.

Looking closely, house 3 uses triangles on top of a rectange. House 5 uses a rectangle on top of a square. Hence, 3 and 5 does not use the same exact shapes.

Now, check other options:
House 1 and 4, the roof and door are different
House 2 and 4, the roof and door are different
House 2 and 5, the roof and door are different

Going through the choices again...House 3 and 5, no they don't have the same shape
House 3: Triangles, rectangle
House 5: Square, rectangle
Therefore House 3 and 4 is incorrect.

However the other houses do not seem to be as closely related either.
House 1: Triangle, rectangle
House 4: Square, rectangle
Same Shapes: 1 and 4 are not the same shape.

I made mistake by focusing on roofs as the shapes.
House 3 and 5
Both have same 1 roof, Rectangle as base

The roof on House 3 is triangles and the roof on House 5 is the square. And the base is the rectangle.

However, both 3 and 5 have a 1 roof shapes as triangles, while the lower shape rectangle. So, House 3 has 2 Triangle. Also they both use the rectangle.

Reasoning:
I examine each house to determine the shapes used.
House 1: Triangle roof, rectangle door
House 2: Rectangle roof/window, smaller house roof/window, rectangle door
House 3: Triangle roof, rectangle door
House 4: Square roof, rectangle door
House 5: Square roof, rectangle door

Houses 3 and 5 both have roofs that are approximately square with a rectangular door. House 3 is composed of 2 triangles and a rectangular door. House 4 is composed of a square and a rectangular door. And House 5 composed of rectangle and door

The shapes used in Houses 4 and 5 are identical: a square and a rectangle.

Answer: B)
