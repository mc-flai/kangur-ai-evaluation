Reasoning: From the first image, we see that F, A, and C are adjacent. From the second image, we see that F, A, and D are adjacent. Therefore, A is adjacent to F, C, and D. Since there are 6 letters A, B, C, D, E, and F, the letter opposite to F must be either B or E. We can see that E is adjacent to F and D, so the letter opposite to F must be B.
Answer: B)
