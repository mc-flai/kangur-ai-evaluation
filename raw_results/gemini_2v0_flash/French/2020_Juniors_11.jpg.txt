Reasoning:
We are given that pq = 2rs. We want to find which of the options cannot be equal to pqrs.
Since pq = 2rs, we can rewrite pqrs as (pq)rs = (2rs)rs = 2(rs)^2 = 2r^2s^2.
So we are looking for a number in the options that cannot be written in the form 2r^2s^2, where r and s are integers.

A) 50 = 2 * 25 = 2 * 5^2.  Here, r = 1, s = 5 or r = 5, s = 1.
B) 100 = 2 * 50 = 2 * (5 * sqrt(2))^2. Here, r = 5, s = sqrt(2), which are not integers. However, 100 = 2 * 50 = 2(5 * sqrt(2))^2 doesn't work. Let's try r = s.  If r = s, we have 2r^4.  The fourth root of 50 would need to be an integer. 100/2 = 50 = r^2s^2. We could have r=5 and s= sqrt(2) which doesn't work. So, 100 might be the answer.

If we say r = s, then we have 2r^4, then we must have r^4 = 25, 50, 100, 225 or 400. This is only possible when r^2 = 5, sqrt(50), 10, 15 or 20. So r can't be an integer.
C) 200 = 2 * 100 = 2 * 10^2.  Here, r = 1, s = 10 or r = 10, s = 1.
D) 450 = 2 * 225 = 2 * 15^2.  Here, r = 1, s = 15 or r = 15, s = 1.
E) 800 = 2 * 400 = 2 * 20^2.  Here, r = 1, s = 20 or r = 20, s = 1.

Let's test B=100.  We need to solve pqrs=100 and pq=2rs. From this, we get 2(rs)^2 = 100. So, (rs)^2 = 50, rs = sqrt(50) = 5sqrt(2), so rs is not an integer, so this is the most likely candidate.

Reasoning:
We established that pqrs = 2(rs)^2. Thus, we look for a value that cannot be written in that form.
We test each one:
A) 50 = 2*(5^2). rs=5. So p=2, q=1, r=1, s=5 (pq=2rs=10). pqrs=2*1*1*5=10 != 50.  If r=5 s=1. p=2, q=1, pq=2rs=10. 2*1*5*1=10 !=50...
B) 100 = 2*50 = 2*5*sqrt(2)...  But we need something that CAN'T be equal to it.  If rs = sqrt(50), then r and s are not integers.  We see if there are integer values of p, q, r, and s that satisfy it.
C) 200 = 2*(10^2). rs = 10. If r=1, s=10.  2rs=20. p=2, q=10.  pqrs = 2*10*1*10 = 200.
D) 450 = 2*(15^2). rs=15. If r=1, s=15.  2rs=30. p=2, q=15.  pqrs = 2*15*1*15 = 450.
E) 800 = 2*(20^2). rs=20. If r=1, s=20.  2rs=40. p=2, q=20.  pqrs = 2*20*1*20 = 800.

For A: 50 = pqrs and pq=2rs. We can try p=5, q=5, and then pq=25=2rs and rs=12.5. We'd need sqrt(12.5) which is not an integer.

Reasoning:
The given condition is pq = 2rs. The question asks which of the given numbers cannot be equal to the product pqrs.
Since pq = 2rs, pqrs can be written as (pq)rs = (2rs)rs = 2(rs)^2. Therefore, we need to check which of the given numbers cannot be written in the form 2 * (integer)^2.
A) 50 = 2 * 25 = 2 * 5^2.
B) 100. If 100 = 2(rs)^2, then (rs)^2 = 50, so rs = sqrt(50), which is not an integer.  This is looking likely!
C) 200 = 2 * 100 = 2 * 10^2.
D) 450 = 2 * 225 = 2 * 15^2.
E) 800 = 2 * 400 = 2 * 20^2.
The only one that cannot be written in the form 2 * (integer)^2 is 100.

Answer: B)
