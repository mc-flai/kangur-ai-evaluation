Reasoning:
To find the smallest possible 12-digit number formed by rearranging the 7 cartons, we need to arrange the cartons in increasing order. The cartons are: 4, 69, 113, 9, 51, 5, 67.
Arranging them in increasing order (based on their numerical value) yields: 4, 5, 9, 51, 67, 69, 113.
There are 7 cartons, so the middle carton will be the 4th one. In the ordered list, the 4th carton is 51.
