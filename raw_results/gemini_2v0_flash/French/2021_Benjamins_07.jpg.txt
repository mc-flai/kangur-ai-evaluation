Reasoning: The question states that Romeo has been waiting almost 1000 seconds for Juliette's reply. We need to determine the closest time estimate from the options.
A) A quarter of an hour is 15 minutes, which is 15 * 60 = 900 seconds.
B) One hour is 60 minutes, which is 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds.
C) Half a day is 12 hours, which is 12 * 60 * 60 = 43200 seconds.
D) One day is 24 hours, which is 24 * 60 * 60 = 86400 seconds.
E) One week is 7 days, which is 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 = 604800 seconds.

Since Romeo has been waiting for almost 1000 seconds, and a quarter of an hour is 900 seconds, option A is the closest estimate.

Answer: A)
