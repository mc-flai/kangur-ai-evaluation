Reasoning: We need to find the smallest possible result when multiplying three distinct numbers from the set {-5, -3, -1, 2, 4, 6}. Since we want the smallest result (most negative), we want to either multiply three positive numbers and then make the result negative, or we multiply two positive numbers with one negative number. Or, multiply three negative numbers to get a negative result.

First case: two large positive numbers times a small negative number: 6 * 4 * -5 = -120
Second case: two small positive numbers times a large negative number: 2 * 4 * -5 = -40
Third case: three largest positive numbers: 6 * 4 * 2 = 48.
Fourth case: three negative numbers: -5 * -3 * -1 = -15
Fifth case: two negative and one positive: -5 * -3 * 6 = 90.
Sixth case: largest positive number * two smallest negative numbers: 6 * -5 * -3 = 90
The product of the largest two positive numbers (6 and 4) and the most negative number (-5) is 6 * 4 * -5 = -120. Let's see if we can obtain anything smaller. Another product is -5 * 6 * 2 = -60. If we take the product of the three most negative numbers: -5 * -3 * -1 = -15, which is not small.

Consider multiplying the numbers with the largest absolute values:
-5, 6, 4. Their product is -120.
Now, we need to check other cases.
-5 * -3 * 6 = 90
-5 * -3 * 4 = 60
-5 * -3 * 2 = 30
-5 * -1 * 6 = 30
-5 * -1 * 4 = 20
-5 * -1 * 2 = 10
-3 * -1 * 6 = 18
-3 * -1 * 4 = 12
-3 * -1 * 2 = 6

6 * 4 * -5 = -120
6 * 2 * -5 = -60
4 * 2 * -5 = -40
6 * 4 * -3 = -72
6 * 2 * -3 = -36
4 * 2 * -3 = -24
6 * 4 * -1 = -24
6 * 2 * -1 = -12
4 * 2 * -1 = -8
Then consider, 6 * 4 * -5 = -120
The smallest product is -120.

Reasoning: By multiplying the two largest positive numbers and the most negative number, we can get a large negative number. 6 * 4 * (-5) = -120. Let's try to use (-5), (-3), 6. Their product will be a positive number, which is not the answer. Then we will examine all the possible options. 6 * 4 * -5 = -120; 6 * 2 * -5 = -60; 4 * 2 * -5 = -40; 6 * 4 * -3 = -72; 6 * 2 * -3 = -36; 4 * 2 * -3 = -24; 6 * 4 * -1 = -24; 6 * 2 * -1 = -12; 4 * 2 * -1 = -8; -5 * -3 * -1 = -15. It seems that -120 is the smallest.
