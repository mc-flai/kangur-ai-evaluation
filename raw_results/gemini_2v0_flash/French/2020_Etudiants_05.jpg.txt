Reasoning:
The question asks which point (A, B, C, D, or E) has an abscissa equal to the product of p and q (pq). From the number line, we see that p and q are both between 0 and 1. When you multiply two numbers between 0 and 1, the result is smaller than both of the original numbers. Therefore, pq will be smaller than both p and q. Looking at the number line, the only point that has an abscissa smaller than both p and q is point B.
Answer: B)
