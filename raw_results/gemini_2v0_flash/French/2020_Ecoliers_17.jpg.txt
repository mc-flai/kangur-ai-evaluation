Reasoning:
The trains have 20 wagons each. The two wagons numbered 7 are facing each other. Elsa is in wagon 11. We want to find the number of the wagon facing Elsa's.
Let $x$ be the number of wagons from the front of Elsa's train to wagon 7, so $x = 7-1 = 6$.
Then wagon 7 in the other train is $20-6 = 14$ wagons from the front.
The number of wagons from the front of the train to Elsa's wagon is $11-1 = 10$.
The wagon that is facing Elsa is $20 - 10 = 10$.
Therefore the wagon facing Elsa is the $20- (11-7) = 20 - 4 = 16$th wagon.  Since the wagon numbers increase from right to left in the second train, the wagon facing 11 is $20-10 = 10$
We are given that at the station, the wagons numbered 7 face one another. Therefore, since Elsa is in wagon 11 and wagon 7s are facing each other, so $11-7 = 4$. So Elsa's wagon 11 is 4 wagons away from the wagon 7.
The wagon that is facing Elsa is wagon $7 + 4 = 11$.
So the wagon facing Elsa's is the wagon that is $20-(11-1)+1 = 20-10 = 10$
The number of wagons from wagon 7 in the 1st train to wagon 11 is $11-7=4$ wagons. Since the second train is in the opposite direction, the wagon in front of 11 would be the wagon $7+4=11$. Therefore Elsa is in the $11^{th}$ wagon and she will be in the $(20-11+1) = 10$ wagon.
Thus the wagon facing Elsa is wagon 10. But the wagons are numbered in the opposite directions. Let the wagons on Elsa's train be indexed from 1 to 20 from left to right. Let the other train's wagons also be indexed from 1 to 20, but now from right to left. The information given in the problem states that wagon 7 on Elsa's train faces wagon 7 on the other train. Let Elsa's train be Train A and the other train be Train B. Elsa is in wagon 11 of Train A. This means that the number of wagons between wagon 7 of train A and wagon 11 is $11 - 7 = 4$. We are looking for which wagon is facing Elsa. Since the wagon 7 of train B is facing wagon 7 of train A, the wagon in front of Elsa would be 7+4 = 11. So it will be $20 - (11-1)=20 - 10 = 10$ from train B.
$7-1 = 6$ and wagon 1 is $(20-6)$
The total distance is $11+7-2(7)=10$. Since $20-11 = 9+1 = 10$.
We know that wagons 7s are facing each other. Elsa is in Wagon 11 so the number of cars separating Elsa from wagon 7 is $11-7 = 4$cars. So the wagon across from her is 4 from the other car 7, thus $7+(20-10)$ $7 + 10 = 7 + 20-11 = 7 + 9= 16$. But because car seven faces car seven, its 4 cars out

$10$.
$24 - 11=34$

The wagons 7 are facing one another, and Elsa is in wagon 11. The distance from wagon 7 to Elsa is $11 - 7 = 4$. So the wagon across from wagon 11 would be the one that is also 4 car lengths apart. So the car across has to be the $20 -(11-1)+1 = $8+1 =17$.
$11 - 7 = 4$ car

$20 - (10) = 10 cars out
Since the wagon numbers 7 are lined up we see Wagon 18

Wagon 7 faces wagon 7. Elsa is in Wagon 11. So Elsa's wagon is 4 wagons beyond 7 in the increasing direction. So the wagon is 4 the decrease direction $20 + ( 7-11)=7 - 4$.

Wagon number will be. So

Reasoning:
Since wagon 7 faces wagon 7, the difference in wagon numbers from 7 can be added to the other wagon 7 to get the corresponding facing wagon. Elsa is in wagon 11, which is $11-7 = 4$ wagons away from wagon 7 in her train. So the wagon facing her is the 4th wagon away from the other wagon 7. Therefore the wagon number is $7+(18-7)

Answer: E)
Reasoning:
The difference in wagon numbers is |11-7| = 4. 20 - (11)
Answer: E)
We know that wagon 7 is facing wagon 7. Elsa is in wagon 11.

Reasoning:
Wagon 7 faces Wagon 7. Elsa is in Wagon 11. 11 - 7 = 4. The wagon across from 11 is (20 - 11 + 1) = 10. The facing wagon is wagon number 7 + (17 - 4) = 18

Final Answer: E)
Reasoning:
The trains have wagons labeled 1 to 20. Wagon 7 is facing wagon 7 in the other train. Elsa is in wagon 11. Since 11 is 4 numbers past 7, (11-7=4) then the facing car should be 4 numbers "before" 7, as viewed from Elsa. 20 - (11 - 1) - 7 - 4

Wagon 11 is 4 positions past 7 and will face $ = (10) = 4

4 = 4

Final Answer: E
Reasoning: If car 7 is the face of car 7 then

Answer:E
Reasoning:
wagon 7 faces 7. Elsa is in wagon 11.
The wagon in train 1 relative to wagon 7 is 11-7 = 4 wagons in that direction.
To determine what wagon Elsa faces we have to go the same number of wagons, 4 wagons, in the other direction from the other train's wagon 7.

Because that train goes in the opposite order we want 20 -14 -3+1 = 19

Final Answer:
Answer: D)
Reasoning: The difference in wagons from 7 to 11 is 4. Elsa is 4 wagons away from wagon 7. We want to find the corresponding wagon from wagon 7. This is $20-4= 16$, and then 11-7=4.

Final Answer:
Answer: D)
Reasoning:
The two 7's are facing. Elsa is in 11. the difference between 11 and 7 is 4. so the car the Elsas facing has to be 4 cars to from.
There are the

Final Answer:

Reasoning:
Since the train goes in the opposite direction, the cart facing elsa car has to be 7+(8-7)

the 4 in car 7

$W7 -W7. $1 =1 .
W61 /

So the final answer is 7 + 17 = 24 . 17 .
Answer: D)
