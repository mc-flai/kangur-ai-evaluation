Reasoning:
Let the vertices of the prism be numbered from 1 to 6. The sum of the numbers on the four vertices of each square is the same. Let's denote this sum by S. The numbers 1 and 5 are already marked on the vertices.
Let the numbers at the vertices of the top triangle be x, a, and 1. Let the numbers at the vertices of the bottom triangle be 5, b, and c. The numbers are from 1 to 6.
The three squares have vertices (x, 1, b, 5), (1, a, c, 5), and (x, a, b, c).
So we have the following equations:
x + 1 + b + 5 = S
1 + a + c + 5 = S
x + a + b + c = S
From the first two equations, we get:
x + b + 6 = a + c + 6
x + b = a + c
Substitute this into the third equation:
x + a + b + c = S
x + (x + b) + b = S
2x + 2b = S
But we know that x + b + 6 = S. So,
2x + 2b = x + b + 6
x + b = 6
Since the numbers from 1 to 6 are used and 1 and 5 are used, the possible values for x and b are pairs from {2, 3, 4, 6} that sum to 6.
Possible pairs for (x, b) are (2, 4) and (4, 2).

If (x, b) = (2, 4), then a + c = x + b = 6. Possible values for a and c from the remaining numbers {3, 6} are a=3, c=6 or a=6, c=3. The numbers on the vertices are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The sum of the numbers on the vertices is 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21.
Then x + 1 + b + 5 = 2 + 1 + 4 + 5 = 12.
1 + a + c + 5 = 1 + 3 + 6 + 5 = 15. This case doesn't work since the sums should be the same.
If (x, b) = (4, 2), then a + c = x + b = 6. Possible values for a and c from the remaining numbers {3, 6} are a=3, c=6 or a=6, c=3.
Then x + 1 + b + 5 = 4 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 12.
1 + a + c + 5 = 1 + 3 + 6 + 5 = 15. This case doesn't work either.

However, suppose x=3. Then b = 6-3 = 3, which is impossible because each number is unique.
Then we can test other combinations, but it seems likely that the situation is impossible.

Let's see if we can express the equation:
3S = (x+1+b+5) + (1+a+c+5) + (x+a+b+c)
3S = 2x+2a+2b+2c + 12
3S = 2(x+a+b+c) + 12
S = (2/3)(x+a+b+c) + 4
x, a, b, c take distinct values from {2, 3, 4, 6}.

The sum 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21
x+a+b+c+1+5 = 21
x+a+b+c = 15
S = (2/3)(15) + 4 = 10+4 = 14
x+1+b+5 = 14
x+b = 8
1+a+c+5 = 14
a+c = 8
But since x,a,b,c are unique, x,b must be two distinct integers that sum to 8.
Likewise, a,c must be two distinct integers that sum to 8.
So we need to select four distinct integers from {2,3,4,6} such that two of them add up to 8 and the other two add up to 8.
There are no such integers. So, the situation is impossible.

Reasoning: By analyzing the given information about the prism and the numbering constraints, we deduce the relationship between the numbers on the vertices of the squares. Then through substitution and elimination, it leads to the conclusion that there is no possible value for x based on the constraints, suggesting the situation is impossible.
