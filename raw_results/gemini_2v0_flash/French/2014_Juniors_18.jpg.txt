Reasoning:
Let $x$ be the number of problems solved by both Lisa and Marie.
Lisa solved 60 problems. Marie solved 60 problems. Total points are 312.
If they both solved $x$ problems, then the number of problems solved only by Lisa is $60-x$ and the number of problems solved only by Marie is $60-x$.
For the $x$ problems solved by both, one person gets 4 points and the other gets 1 point. So total points are $5x$.
For the problems solved only by Lisa, Lisa gets 4 points and Marie gets 0. Points are $4(60-x)$.
For the problems solved only by Marie, Marie gets 4 points and Lisa gets 0. Points are $4(60-x)$.
Thus we have the following points breakdown:
If Lisa solves it first (60 - x) times and Marie solves it second, we have: 4(60-x) + (60-x) + 5x = 312.
Then, if Marie solves it first (60-x) times and Lisa solves it second, we have: (60 - x) + 4(60 - x) + 5x = 312.
In either case, the points will be the same.
The total score is $312$, and the total number of problems solved is $x + (60-x) + (60-x) = 120 - x$.
We have: $5x + 4(60-x) + 1(0) = 312$
Let $c$ be the number of problems solved by both.
Let $a$ be the number of problems solved by Lisa only. $a = 60 - c$
Let $b$ be the number of problems solved by Marie only. $b = 60 - c$
Total score = $4a + b + a + 4b = 312$.
The first person to solve the problems gets 4 points and the second person gets 1 point. Together the problems solved jointly are worth 5 points each, so total is $5c$.
Total score is $4(60) + 1(0)$ and the total score is $1(0) + 4(60) = 240$.
Total problems solved is $x + (60 - x) + (60 - x) = 60 + 60 - x = 120 - x$.
We have $a + c = 60$ and $b + c = 60$. Thus $a = b = 60 - c$.

The total points is 312 = $4a + c + a + 4c$. Lisa gets first $a$ problems and Marie gets first $c$ problems.
So $4(60-x) + x + (60 - x) = 312$. If Marie solves it first we have $a$ problems and $b$ problems. Marie gets $a$ and Lisa gets $4c$. Lisa's problems are only $a$ so $4c + a$.
The total points equation is:
$4a+b=x$ if person A and $b+4a$ by person B.
$x$ problems are solved by both Lisa and Marie so it gives $5x$ to $x*1+1$
$5x + 4(60-x) + (60-x) = 312$. Total points are $5c + 4(60 - c)$. Then $x = a$.
Let number of problems solved by both be $x$.
Then number of problems solved only by Lisa = $60-x$. These contribute $4(60-x)$ points to total score.
Number of problems solved only by Marie = $60-x$. These contribute $4(60-x)$.
Together they solved x problems, giving x* (4+1) points.
Therefore, 5x+ 4(60 - x) + (60 - x).
Total points = $5x = 312$ so, $(60-x) + (60 - c$
$5x + 5(0)$ points from shared problems.
Then Total problems = $x = a + (60 - x) a*4(60 x)$. Let number of common problems be c so they get $x c$.
Equation is  $4(c + 4b) or (x * 1 *4)$  The point of this equation where Lisa and Marie solve are not 0.
$312 = (x * (60-x)) = 312. There should be a way to formulate $x$.

$5c + 4(60 - c) = 312$. Thus x

From all the equations,
Lisa 60 points = $A = 60. $
So $x$ is shared between Lisa and Mario so Lisa got it first (240 - 4x*number problems )

Let $n$ be the common problems solved between them so the total numbers will be total_problems_solved = $(A x + (60 x

Reasoning:
Let x be the number of problems solved by both. Lisa solved 60 and Marie solved 60. Each problem solved by both gives a total of 5 points. Therefore, those solved by one of them only must give a result of $312-5x$. Lisa and Marie must then solve (60 - x) alone. This equals the points from problems they solved alone or the total of $312 = (Number they all all = or Total points = .5 * + ( 4 * solve1 ) = 312)$.

Reasoning:
Let $c$ be the number of problems solved correctly by both Lisa and Marie. Then Lisa solved $60 - c$ problems alone and Marie solved $60 - c$ problems alone. For the $c$ problems, they get $5c$ points. For each of the $60-c$ problems Lisa solved alone, she gets 4 points. For each of the $60-c$ problems Marie solved alone, she gets 4 points. So the total points are $5c + 4(60-c)$ + $(60-c)$.

However this method makes no sense at all as points from one.

Reasoning: Let $x$ = the number of problems that both Marie and Lisa solved. Then, Marie solved $60 - x$ problems that Lisa didn't and Lisa solved $60 - x$ problems that Marie didn't. So the points can be expressed as the equation below: $4(60-x) + 1(60-x) + 5x = 312$ $240-4x + 60 -x +5x = 312$ $300 = 312$ (This equation is not accurate).

Reasoning:
Let $x$ be the number of problems both Lisa and Marie solved. Then $60-x$ is the number of problems only Lisa solved and $60-x$ is the number of problems only Marie solved. The score for problems solved by both is $5x$. The score for Lisa is $4(60-x) = 240-4x$. The score for Marie is $(60-x)$. But the total points cannot split to be Lisa's and Marie's because they contribute.
