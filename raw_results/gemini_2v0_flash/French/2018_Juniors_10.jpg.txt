Reasoning:
To get from K to L, we can analyze the possible paths:
1. K to top vertex: 1 path. Then from top vertex to L: 1 path. Total = 1*1 = 1.
2. K to bottom vertex: 1 path. Then from bottom vertex to L: 1 path. Total = 1*1 = 1.
3. K to middle vertex via top route: 1 path. Then from middle vertex to top vertex of L: 1 path, to bottom vertex: 1 path, and to direct path to L = 1 path. Hence total 3. Total = 1*3 = 3.
4. K to middle vertex via bottom route: 1 path. Then from middle vertex to top vertex of L: 1 path, to bottom vertex: 1 path, and to direct path to L = 1 path. Hence total 3. Total = 1*3 = 3.
5. K to middle vertex directly. Then from middle vertex to top vertex of L: 1 path, to bottom vertex: 1 path, and to direct path to L = 1 path. Hence total 3. Total = 1*3 = 3.
Adding all the combinations, 1+1+3+3+3=11. This is none of the given options.

Let's try another method.

K to middle node gives 3 paths.
From middle node: 1 path to upper node connected to L
From middle node: 1 path to lower node connected to L
From middle node: 1 path straight to L
Then from upper node to L gives 1 path
Then from lower node to L gives 1 path

Path 1: straight up from K, straight to L. = 1
Path 2: straight down from K, straight to L. = 1
Path 3: go up to middle, then up to L = 1
Path 4: go up to middle, then down to L = 1
Path 5: go up to middle, then right to L = 1
Path 6: go down to middle, then up to L = 1
Path 7: go down to middle, then down to L = 1
Path 8: go down to middle, then right to L = 1
Path 9: go straight up from K to middle, then up to L = 1
Path 10: go straight up from K to middle, then down to L = 1
Path 11: go straight up from K to middle, then right to L = 1

Total = 11. Also, none of the options are close. Is there a mistake? Upon review, K does not go straight up it goes to the split junction first, so there is no third option to go directly up from K!
Paths: from K, you must go through the center junction. This is the first split!

First, you must choose path up to middle, path down to middle, or direct to middle (3 options). From the middle, there are 3 options to go to L as well -- up, down, and direct to L.

Path 1: Up to middle, then up to L.
Path 2: Up to middle, then down to L.
Path 3: Up to middle, then direct to L.
Path 4: Down to middle, then up to L.
Path 5: Down to middle, then down to L.
Path 6: Down to middle, then direct to L.
Path 7: Direct to middle, then up to L.
Path 8: Direct to middle, then down to L.
Path 9: Direct to middle, then direct to L.

Therefore there are a total of 9 ways.
