Reasoning:
The question asks in how many ways can 1001 be written as the sum of two prime numbers.
Since 1001 is an odd number, one of the prime numbers must be 2.
If one of the prime numbers is 2, then the other number is 1001 - 2 = 999.
Since the sum of the digits of 999 is 9 + 9 + 9 = 27, which is divisible by 3, 999 is divisible by 3. Thus, 999 is not a prime number.
Therefore, there are no two prime numbers whose sum is 1001.
