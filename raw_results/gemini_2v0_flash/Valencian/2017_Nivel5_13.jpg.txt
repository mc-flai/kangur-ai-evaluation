Raonament: The bridge has a height of 300 meters and a weight of 8,000,000 kg. The model has a weight of 1 kg and it's made of the same material. The ratio of the weights is 8,000,000:1. Since the volume (and hence weight) scales with the cube of the height, the height scales with the cube root of the weight ratio. So the scaling factor is $\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{8000000}} = \frac{1}{200}$.
The height of the model will be 300 meters * (1/200) = 1.5 meters.
