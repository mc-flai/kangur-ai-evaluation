Raonament: La peça que falta és la peça inferior esquerra. Observant les altres peces de la figura, podem veure que dins dels triangles hi ha la descomposició en factors primers del nombre que hi ha a l'interior del triangle. La peça que falta té els nombres 3, 5 i 7 dins de cercles, per tant el número de dins del triangle ha de ser 3 * 5 * 7 = 105. Però cap de les opcions té el 105. Hi ha un error en la pregunta. Anul·laré la pregunta.

Raonament: The empty space should have 3, 5 and 7 as factors. The number that the product of these factors results in, is 3 x 5 x 7 = 105. None of the options are correct, because they don't equal to 105. In this case it is more likely that this triangle should be composed of the factors 3, 5 and 7. But based on the other pieces, it appears the factors are placed on the vertices of each triangle. Looking at the triangle with "15", its factors are "3" and "5". Likewise, in triangle "21" with factors of "3" and "7" are placed in vertices. In the missing piece, 3, 5, and 7 are in the vertices of the triangle and it would be equal to their multiplication: 3x5x7 = 105. Therefore we need the triangle with the factors 3, 5 and 7. Checking options A, B, C, D and E - the factors in the diagram are inside circles in each of the triangle corners, therefore we are looking for these to be 3, 5, 7. Option A: Has the 1, 3 and 5. Incorrect. Option B: Has the 3, 5, and 7. Option C: Has the 1, 3 and 5. Option D: Has the 3, 5, and 7. Option E has the 3 and 7 factors, but is also incomplete. There might be an error, but Option B matches the characteristics, that the number of it's factors is 317, but has wrong prime factors.

Resposta: D)
