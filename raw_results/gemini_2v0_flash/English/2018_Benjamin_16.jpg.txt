Reasoning:
First, we need to find the combinations of 3 distinct numbers from the list {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} that sum to 8 (Monika's numbers).
Possible combinations are:
1 + 2 + 5 = 8
1 + 3 + 4 = 8

Next, we need to find the combinations of 3 distinct numbers from the same list that sum to 7 (Daniel's numbers).
Possible combinations are:
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
1 + 3 + 3 = 7 (Invalid because the numbers must be distinct)
2 + 3 + 2 = 7 (Invalid because the numbers must be distinct)

Monika's possible sets are {1, 2, 5} and {1, 3, 4}.
Daniel's possible set is {1, 2, 4}.

Now, let's see how many numbers Monika and Daniel have in common.

If Monika chose {1, 2, 5} and Daniel chose {1, 2, 4}, they have 1 and 2 in common, so 2 numbers.
If Monika chose {1, 3, 4} and Daniel chose {1, 2, 4}, they have 1 and 4 in common, so 2 numbers.

In either case, Monika and Daniel have 2 numbers in common.
