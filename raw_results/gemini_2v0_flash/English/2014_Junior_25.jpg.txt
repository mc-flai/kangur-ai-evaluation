Reasoning:
Let $B$ be the initial number of blue frogs and $G$ be the initial number of green frogs. The initial total number of frogs is $B+G$.
The number of blue frogs increases by 60%, so the new number of blue frogs is $B + 0.6B = 1.6B$.
The number of green frogs decreases by 60%, so the new number of green frogs is $G - 0.6G = 0.4G$.
The new total number of frogs is $1.6B + 0.4G$.
The initial ratio of blue to green frogs is $\frac{B}{G}$.
The new ratio of blue to green frogs is $\frac{1.6B}{0.4G}$.
We are given that the new ratio of blue to green frogs matches the original ratio of green to blue frogs, so $\frac{1.6B}{0.4G} = \frac{G}{B}$.
This implies that $1.6B^2 = 0.4G^2$, which simplifies to $4B^2 = G^2$, so $G = 2B$.
Now we can calculate the initial and new total numbers of frogs in terms of $B$.
Initial total: $B + G = B + 2B = 3B$.
New total: $1.6B + 0.4G = 1.6B + 0.4(2B) = 1.6B + 0.8B = 2.4B$.
The percentage change in the total number of frogs is $\frac{\text{new total} - \text{initial total}}{\text{initial total}} \times 100 = \frac{2.4B - 3B}{3B} \times 100 = \frac{-0.6B}{3B} \times 100 = -0.2 \times 100 = -20\%$.
Since the question asks "By what percentage has the total number of frogs changed?", we consider the absolute value of the percentage change which is 20%. However, the total number of frogs decreased by 20%, so there might be an error in the problem statement.

However, if the question is asking for the change in percentage, we just need to consider the absolute value which will give 20%.
Then, since it says the green number decreases by 60% and blue number increase by 60% and it gives us a matching initial ratio.
The new ratio is just flipped, which means $1.6B/0.4G = G/B$ giving us $1.6B^2 = 0.4G^2$
The percentage change is $\frac{New - Old}{Old} = \frac{2.4B-3B}{3B} = \frac{-0.6}{3} = -0.2 = -20 \%$
Because we need to provide a non-negative answer, the decrease is the same magnitude as the increase

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let $B$ be the number of blue frogs and $G$ be the number of green frogs initially. The total number of frogs initially is $B + G$.
The number of blue frogs increases by 60%, so the new number of blue frogs is $1.6B$.
The number of green frogs decreases by 60%, so the new number of green frogs is $0.4G$.
The new total number of frogs is $1.6B + 0.4G$.
The initial ratio of the number of blue frogs to the number of green frogs is $B/G$.
The new ratio of the number of blue frogs to the number of green frogs is $1.6B/(0.4G)$.
The new ratio matches the original ratio of the number of green frogs to the number of blue frogs, so $1.6B/(0.4G) = G/B$.
This implies $1.6B^2 = 0.4G^2$, which means $4B^2 = G^2$, so $G = 2B$.
The initial total is $B + G = B + 2B = 3B$.
The new total is $1.6B + 0.4G = 1.6B + 0.4(2B) = 1.6B + 0.8B = 2.4B$.
Percentage change = $\frac{2.4B - 3B}{3B} \times 100 = \frac{-0.6B}{3B} \times 100 = -0.2 \times 100 = -20\%$.
The magnitude of the percentage change is $20\%$.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let $B$ be the initial number of blue frogs and $G$ the initial number of green frogs. Total initial number of frogs is $B+G$.
After the changes, the number of blue frogs is $1.6B$ and the number of green frogs is $0.4G$. The new total number of frogs is $1.6B+0.4G$.

We are given that $\frac{1.6B}{0.4G} = \frac{G}{B}$, which simplifies to $1.6B^2 = 0.4G^2$, so $4B^2 = G^2$ and $G = 2B$.
Initial total number of frogs: $B+G = B+2B = 3B$.
New total number of frogs: $1.6B + 0.4G = 1.6B + 0.4(2B) = 1.6B + 0.8B = 2.4B$.

Percentage change: $\frac{\text{New} - \text{Old}}{\text{Old}} \times 100 = \frac{2.4B - 3B}{3B} \times 100 = \frac{-0.6B}{3B} \times 100 = -0.2 \times 100 = -20\%$.
The absolute value of the change is 20%.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let $B$ be the original number of blue frogs, and $G$ be the original number of green frogs. The total number of frogs is $B+G$.
The number of blue frogs becomes $B + 0.6B = 1.6B$, and the number of green frogs becomes $G - 0.6G = 0.4G$.
The new total number of frogs is $1.6B + 0.4G$.
The new ratio of blue frogs to green frogs is $\frac{1.6B}{0.4G}$, and this matches the original ratio of green frogs to blue frogs, so $\frac{1.6B}{0.4G} = \frac{G}{B}$.
Cross-multiplying, we get $1.6B^2 = 0.4G^2$, so $4B^2 = G^2$, and $G = 2B$.

The original total number of frogs is $B + G = B + 2B = 3B$.
The new total number of frogs is $1.6B + 0.4G = 1.6B + 0.4(2B) = 1.6B + 0.8B = 2.4B$.
The percentage change is $\frac{2.4B - 3B}{3B} \times 100 = \frac{-0.6B}{3B} \times 100 = -0.2 \times 100 = -20\%$.
Thus, the total number of frogs decreased by 20%.
