Reasoning: The 3x3x3 cube is made of 27 smaller cubes, not 9 as stated in the problem. I believe there is a typo in the question, and it should have said a 3x3x1 cuboid is made of 9 identical building blocks. Given this assumption, we need to figure out which of the cuboids could be made by assembling 9 blocks in the given configuration (2 grey, 1 white). The total number of grey blocks would be 18 and white 9.

A) has 18 grey and 9 white cubes
B) has 18 grey and 9 white cubes
C) has 18 grey and 9 white cubes
D) has 18 grey and 9 white cubes
E) has 18 grey and 9 white cubes

Now let's look at each shape and see if it's constructible with these blocks. We know that the side with a single white cube needs to be able to be assembled with blocks of the provided configuration. In other words, there needs to be a corner white cube.

A) is a possible cube, but the top left corner in the picture has a single white cube, meaning it can be constructed
B) the front most left column is white, meaning it can't be constructed.
C) the front most left column is white, meaning it can't be constructed.
D) the front most right column is white, meaning it can't be constructed.
E) the bottom right corner is white, meaning it can be constructed.

Comparing option A to option E, we can see that the top layer of option E is a combination that isn't constructable given 2 grey and 1 white. For example, the top left is white and the other two are gray. Also, the bottom layer is also incorrect. A is constructed with corner white cubes and is therefore constructable.

Answer: A)
