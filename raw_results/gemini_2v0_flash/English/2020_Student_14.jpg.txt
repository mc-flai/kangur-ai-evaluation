Reasoning:
The given equation (a - a^(-1))^2 + (b - b^(-1))^2 + (c - c^(-1))^2 = 0 implies that each term must be 0 since they are all squared and therefore non-negative. Thus, a - a^(-1) = 0, b - b^(-1) = 0, and c - c^(-1) = 0.
This means a = a^(-1), b = b^(-1), and c = c^(-1).
Therefore, a^2 = 1, b^2 = 1, and c^2 = 1.
This implies a, b, c can each be either 1 or -1. Thus, a, b, c âˆˆ {1, -1}.
a + b + c can be -3 (if a=b=c=-1), -1 (if two of them are -1 and one is 1), 1 (if two of them are 1 and one is -1), or 3 (if a=b=c=1).
Therefore, a+b+c cannot be 0.
