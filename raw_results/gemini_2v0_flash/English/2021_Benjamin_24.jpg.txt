Reasoning:
Let's use variables to represent the weights of each fruit: A (apple), O (orange), P (pear), and Pe (peach). We can translate the given statements into inequalities:

1. A + O = P + Pe
2. A + P < O + Pe
3. P + O < A + Pe

From equation 1, we can rewrite it as A = P + Pe - O. Substitute this into inequality 2:
(P + Pe - O) + P < O + Pe
2P < 2O
P < O

Similarly, from equation 1, we can rewrite it as O = P + Pe - A. Substitute this into inequality 3:
P + (P + Pe - A) < A + Pe
2P < 2A
P < A

Now we know P < O and P < A. We want to find the heaviest fruit.
Let's analyze inequality 2: A + P < O + Pe. Since P < O, it suggests that to satisfy this inequality, Pe must be greater than A. However, we have A = P + Pe - O, thus Pe = A + O - P
Substitute this into inequality 3: P + O < A + (A + O - P)
2P < 2A
P < A, which is already known.

From the given equations, we can not isolate any individual fruit and determine it's weight relative to each other fruit to be able to determine which is the heaviest fruit.
