Reasoning: To stop all traffic between A and B, we need to cut off all possible paths between them. Looking at the diagram, there appear to be three distinct "routes" or groups of bridges linking A and B. Closing just one bridge will not stop all traffic. If we close the two bridges that connect the top "island" near A to the "island" at the right and to the middle "island" near B, the traffic stops between A and B. Alternatively, closing bridges close to where they connect into either A or B can stop traffic.
Answer: B)
