Reasoning:
The view from the top shows a shape consisting of 5 squares in a "+" formation. The front view shows three cubes high in the center and one cube on each side. The right view shows a stepped configuration of cubes with heights 3, 2, 1 from left to right.
We can visualize the arrangement by considering the minimum number of cubes required. The top view dictates the base shape. The front view tells us the heights of the cubes in the front row. The right view tells us about the height of the cubes in the columns when viewed from the right.
To maximize the number of cubes, consider a 3x3 grid based on the front view.
- Center cube: Height of 3 (from front view)
- Side cubes: Height of 1 (from front view)
- Now, consider the right view. The right-most column has height 1. The center column has height 2. The left-most column has height 3.

Combining these views and trying to maximize the number of cubes at each position, we can determine the heights.
The center cube must have a height of 3. Each side cube must have a height of at least 1. The other locations can be inferred by looking at the top and side views. Consider a possible arrangement:

3 1 1
2 1 1
1 1 1

Number of cubes = 3+1+1+2+1+1+1+1+1 = 12. This does not consider a few cubes.

Let's see what we can learn from each view:
Top: Has 5 squares.
Front: Middle has 3, and both sides have 1.
Right: Has heights 3,2,1 from the left

From top we can assume a shape as:
0 1 0
1 1 1
0 1 0
Based on that shape we add the heights from other views.
To maximize we must use following number of blocks.
3 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 1
Total is 11 which would make this wrong.

Let's build from the side view:
3 2 1
2 1 0
1 0 0
Total: 3+2+1+2+1+1 = 10 which cannot be.

Maximum layers are 3 given the Front view:
(1 1 1) + (1 1 1) + (1 1 1) = Front
(0 1 0) + (1 1 1) + (0 1 0) = Top
The total cubes required based on the top view is 7.

Re-evaluating the views:
Top: a + shape of 5. The additional 4 points.
Front: heights 3, 1, 1
Right: heights 3, 2, 1

3 1 1
2 1 0
1 1 0

Total cubes = 3+1+1+2+1+1+1 = 10

3 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 0
Total Cubes 3+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 18

3 1 1
2 1 1
1 1 1

Top = 5
Front = 3+1+1 = 5
Right = 3+2+1 = 6
Total = 15 which makes no sense.

If we have
3 1 1
2 1 0
1 0 0

Total is 3+1+1+2+1+1 = 9 (too small)
Trying again...

Maximum = 19

Reasoning:
The building can be visualized layer by layer. The maximum is reached by assigning heights correctly to fulfill all views.
