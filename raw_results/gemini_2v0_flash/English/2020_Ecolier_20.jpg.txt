Reasoning:
Let's analyze each statement to determine the actual day of the week.
- Adam: If yesterday was Wednesday, then today is Thursday.
- Beto: If tomorrow will be Friday, then today is Thursday.
- Carlos: If the day before yesterday was Tuesday, then today is Thursday.
- David: If the day after tomorrow is Saturday, then today is Thursday.
- Eli: Says that today is Monday.

Since Adam, Beto, Carlos and David all imply today is Thursday, and Eli states today is Monday, Eli must be the one who is wrong.

Answer: E)
