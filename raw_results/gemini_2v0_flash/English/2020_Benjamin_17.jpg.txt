Reasoning:
We need to visualize joining two copies of each shape by their ends and see if we can form a closed shape without any lines crossing.

A) Two 'G' shapes will make a rectangle with a line inside that almost forms a rectangle itself.
B) Two of this shape joined together form a rectangle.
C) Two 'C' shapes will also form a rectangle.
D) Two of this shape joined together form a rectangle.
E) Two of this shape joined together form a rectangle.

Since the question specifies a "closed piece without crosses," we must ensure that the joined shape does not have any intersecting lines. Shapes B, C, D and E can form closed pieces without crosses when joined to their identical shape. Shape A however will create an "inner" square with a line that may be interpreted as a "cross". Thus, shapes B, C, D, and E are more suitable answers. Without more info, it's hard to choose one over the others. However, if we only assume perfect rectangles form the pieces, then the answer would be (B)

Answer: B)
