Reasoning:
Let the acute angles of the right-angled triangles be $\alpha$ and $\beta$, where $\alpha > \beta$. We are given that five triangles are arranged such that their larger acute angles touch. This means $5\alpha = 360^{\circ}$, so $\alpha = 72^{\circ}$.
Since $\alpha + \beta = 90^{\circ}$, we have $\beta = 90^{\circ} - \alpha = 90^{\circ} - 72^{\circ} = 18^{\circ}$.
We want to arrange $n$ triangles such that their smaller acute angles touch. Thus, we need $n\beta = 360^{\circ}$.
So $n(18^{\circ}) = 360^{\circ}$, which means $n = \frac{360^{\circ}}{18^{\circ}} = 20$.
