Reasoning:
The problem asks for the area of the gray region not covered by the white squares. This is equal to the total area of the gray square minus the sum of the areas of the three white squares. The area of the gray square is given as 81. The areas of two of the white squares are given as 9 and 4. Since the total area of the gray square is 81, its side length is $\sqrt{81} = 9$. Also, the side lengths of the white squares with areas 9 and 4 are $\sqrt{9} = 3$ and $\sqrt{4} = 2$, respectively. From the image, we can deduce that the side length of the white square with area "?" is the difference between the side length of the gray square and the sum of the side lengths of the other two white squares. Thus, the side length of the white square is $9 - (3+2) = 9-5=4$. Then the area of this square is $4^2 = 16$.
The total area of the white squares is $9 + 4 + 16 = 29$.
Therefore, the area of the gray region is $81 - 29 = 52$.
