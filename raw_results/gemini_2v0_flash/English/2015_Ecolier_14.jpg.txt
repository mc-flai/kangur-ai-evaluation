Reasoning: Peter starts at point S and goes in the direction of the arrow. The first crossing he reaches is the one in the top right of the picture. He turns right. The next crossing is the one at the upper left of the diagram. He turns left. The next crossing is at the bottom left (labeled D), where he turns right. The next crossing is the bottom right (labeled A), where he turns left. Note: There's no label B, C, and E in the image. Thus, he does not reach B, C, and E. Since all options except A and D are not possible, he does not reach B, C, and E. Since only one answer is allowed, let us re-examine the diagram, the path from S is right, left, right, left, which goes through the upper right crossing, upper left crossing, D, and A, therefore he reaches A and D.
Reasoning: The answer must be B, C, or E. But there is no such crossings in the image. So, he must not be able to reach the middle part.
At the crossing near S, turn right.
At the next crossing, turn left.
At the next crossing (labeled D), turn right.
At the next crossing (labeled A), turn left.
He only reaches A and D.
The question is: Which crossing does he not reach?
Based on the diagram, the options are A, B, C, D, E. Since Peter goes in the direction of the arrow, he reaches upper right, upper left, D, A. There are no labels B, C, E so it is likely the middle crossings are assumed as B, C, E.
If he turns right after S. He reaches upper right
Then he turns left to upper left
Then he turns right to D
Then he turns left to A
So he doesn't reach E.
The turnings are right, left, right, left.

Answer: E)
