Reasoning:
We are looking for how many of the given pairs could be the exception to the rule that N is divisible by all integers from 2 to 11. For each pair, if N is not divisible by those two numbers, then it must be divisible by all other numbers from 2 to 11.
Let's analyze each pair:
- (6,7): If N is not divisible by 6 and 7, it must be divisible by 2,3,4,5,8,9,10,11. Since 6 = 2 * 3, N being divisible by 2 and 3 means N is divisible by 6, which contradicts the assumption that N is not divisible by 6. So, this is not a possible exception.
- (7,8): If N is not divisible by 7 and 8, it must be divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,9,10,11. This is a possible exception.
- (8,9): If N is not divisible by 8 and 9, it must be divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11. Since 8 = 2 * 4, N being divisible by 2 and 4 means we need to check if divisibility by 4 is affected if 8 is not divisible. Similarly 9 = 3*3, N being divisible by 3 may be linked to 9. However this is a valid pair as it's not divisible by 8 or 9.
- (9,10): If N is not divisible by 9 and 10, it must be divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,11. Since 6 = 2 * 3, and 10=2*5. We know it must be divisible by 3, so N needs a factor of 3. Also we need a factor of 5 as 10 is not divisible. So, this is a possible exception.
- (10,11): If N is not divisible by 10 and 11, it must be divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Since 10 = 2 * 5, divisibility of 2 and 5 will determine the value. So, this is a possible exception.

In summary, the possible pairs are: (7,8), (8,9), (9,10) and (10,11).

Thus there are 4 possible pairs.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
We must consider each of the pairs (6,7), (7,8), (8,9), (9,10), and (10,11) to determine how many of them can be the two numbers from 2 to 11 that do not divide N.
(6,7): If N is not divisible by 6 and 7, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11. Since N is divisible by 2 and 3, N must be divisible by 6 (2*3), so this is a contradiction.
(7,8): If N is not divisible by 7 and 8, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11. No immediate contradiction.
(8,9): If N is not divisible by 8 and 9, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11. No immediate contradiction.
(9,10): If N is not divisible by 9 and 10, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11. No immediate contradiction.
(10,11): If N is not divisible by 10 and 11, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. No immediate contradiction.
There are 4 pairs that could be this exception: (7,8), (8,9), (9,10), and (10,11).

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
We are looking for the number of pairs that can be excluded from the list of divisors of N (2-11). If we exclude (6,7), N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11. But since N is divisible by 2 and 3, N must be divisible by 6. So (6,7) can't be the exception.
If we exclude (7,8), N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11. This is possible.
If we exclude (8,9), N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11. This is possible.
If we exclude (9,10), N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11. This is possible.
If we exclude (10,11), N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This is possible.
Therefore, there are 4 pairs that can be the exception.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
We need to check each pair to see if it's possible to have the number N not divisible by both of them, but divisible by all other numbers from 2 to 11.

(6, 7): If N is not divisible by 6 and 7, it must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11. But since N is divisible by 2 and 3, it must be divisible by 6, which is a contradiction.
(7, 8): If N is not divisible by 7 and 8, it must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11. This is possible.
(8, 9): If N is not divisible by 8 and 9, it must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11. This is possible.
(9, 10): If N is not divisible by 9 and 10, it must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11. This is possible.
(10, 11): If N is not divisible by 10 and 11, it must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This is possible.

There are 4 possible pairs: (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11).

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
The question states that N is divisible by all integers from 2 to 11 *except two of these numbers*. We need to find out how many of the given pairs can be the exceptions.

(6,7): If N is not divisible by 6 and 7, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Since N is divisible by 2 and 3, N must also be divisible by 6 (6=2*3). This contradicts the problem statement. So (6,7) cannot be the exceptions.

(7,8): If N is not divisible by 7 and 8, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. This is possible.

(8,9): If N is not divisible by 8 and 9, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 11. This is possible.

(9,10): If N is not divisible by 9 and 10, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 11. This is possible.

(10,11): If N is not divisible by 10 and 11, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. This is possible.

There are 4 pairs for which it's possible that N is not divisible.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
We need to consider each pair and determine if it's possible that *only* those two numbers are not factors of N. If N is not divisible by x and y, but divisible by all other numbers between 2 and 11 inclusive, can that occur?

(6,7): If N is not divisible by 6 and 7, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 11. If N is divisible by 2 and 3, it must be divisible by 6. Contradiction.
(7,8): If N is not divisible by 7 and 8, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. This is possible.
(8,9): If N is not divisible by 8 and 9, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 11. This is possible.
(9,10): If N is not divisible by 9 and 10, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 11. This is possible.
(10,11): If N is not divisible by 10 and 11, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. This is possible.

(7,8), (8,9), (9,10) and (10,11) can be the exception. There are 4 such pairs.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:

*   **(6, 7):** If N is not divisible by 6 and 7, N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11. But if N is divisible by 2 and 3, it's also divisible by 6, which contradicts the initial condition.
*   **(7, 8):** If N is not divisible by 7 and 8, N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11. This is possible.
*   **(8, 9):** If N is not divisible by 8 and 9, N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11. This is possible.
*   **(9, 10):** If N is not divisible by 9 and 10, N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11. This is possible.
*   **(10, 11):** If N is not divisible by 10 and 11, N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This is possible.

There are 4 possible pairs (7,8), (8,9), (9,10), (10,11).

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
For a pair to be a valid exception, neither number in the pair should be a product of other numbers that N is divisible by.

(6, 7): Since 6 = 2 * 3, and N is divisible by 2 and 3, N must also be divisible by 6. Invalid.
(7, 8): 7 and 8 do not share factors, so this is a potential exception.
(8, 9): 8 and 9 do not share factors, so this is a potential exception.
(9, 10): 9 and 10 do not share factors, so this is a potential exception.
(10, 11): 10 and 11 do not share factors, so this is a potential exception.

The pairs (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), and (10, 11) can be valid exceptions.
So, 4 pairs.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
The question asks us to find how many of the pairs could be the two integers between 2 and 11 (inclusive) which don't divide N. We test each pair one by one:

(6,7): If N is not divisible by 6 and 7, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11. However, since N is divisible by both 2 and 3, N must also be divisible by 6. So, this pair doesn't work.

(7,8): If N is not divisible by 7 and 8, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11. This is possible.

(8,9): If N is not divisible by 8 and 9, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11. This is possible.

(9,10): If N is not divisible by 9 and 10, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11. This is possible.

(10,11): If N is not divisible by 10 and 11, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This is possible.

So the pairs which could be the exceptions are: (7,8), (8,9), (9,10), (10,11). Thus, there are 4 such pairs.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
Analyze each of the pairs given.
*   (6,7): If N is not divisible by 6 and 7, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 11. But since N is divisible by both 2 and 3, N must be divisible by 6, which is a contradiction. Thus, (6,7) is NOT a possible pair.
*   (7,8): If N is not divisible by 7 and 8, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. No immediate contradiction. Thus, (7,8) IS a possible pair.
*   (8,9): If N is not divisible by 8 and 9, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 11. No immediate contradiction. Thus, (8,9) IS a possible pair.
*   (9,10): If N is not divisible by 9 and 10, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 11. No immediate contradiction. Thus, (9,10) IS a possible pair.
*   (10,11): If N is not divisible by 10 and 11, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. No immediate contradiction. Thus, (10,11) IS a possible pair.

There are 4 pairs for which it is possible that N is not divisible.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
We analyze each pair:
(6,7): If N is divisible by all integers from 2 to 11 except 6 and 7, N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11. Since 6 = 2*3, N would have to be divisible by 6. So, this is not a possibility.
(7,8): If N is divisible by all integers from 2 to 11 except 7 and 8, N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11. This is a possibility.
(8,9): If N is divisible by all integers from 2 to 11 except 8 and 9, N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11. This is a possibility.
(9,10): If N is divisible by all integers from 2 to 11 except 9 and 10, N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11. This is a possibility.
(10,11): If N is divisible by all integers from 2 to 11 except 10 and 11, N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This is a possibility.

Thus, we have four possible pairs.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
The goal is to see how many of the pairs (6,7), (7,8), (8,9), (9,10), and (10,11) could be the two numbers such that N is divisible by every number from 2 to 11 except those two.

*   (6,7): If N is not divisible by 6 and 7, then N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11. Since N is divisible by 2 and 3, N must be divisible by 6 (2*3). This is a contradiction, so (6,7) doesn't work.
*   (7,8): If N is not divisible by 7 and 8, then N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11. This can work.
*   (8,9): If N is not divisible by 8 and 9, then N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11. This can work.
*   (9,10): If N is not divisible by 9 and 10, then N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11. This can work.
*   (10,11): If N is not divisible by 10 and 11, then N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This can work.

There are 4 valid pairs: (7,8), (8,9), (9,10), and (10,11).

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
The key idea here is to check the pairs such that if they are not divisible, then we need to check the numbers that are divisible whether they are prime factors of these numbers.

(6,7): N is divisible by all from 2 to 11 except 6,7. Then N must be divisible by 2,3,4,5,8,9,10,11. But we know that 6=2*3, hence this is a contradiction.
(7,8): N is divisible by all from 2 to 11 except 7,8. Then N must be divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,9,10,11. Possible.
(8,9): N is divisible by all from 2 to 11 except 8,9. Then N must be divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11. Possible.
(9,10): N is divisible by all from 2 to 11 except 9,10. Then N must be divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,11. Possible.
(10,11): N is divisible by all from 2 to 11 except 10,11. Then N must be divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Possible.

So, (7,8), (8,9), (9,10), (10,11) are all possible pairs and hence there are 4 possible pairs.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
We need to determine which pairs of numbers, if excluded as divisors of N, do NOT force N to be divisible by both numbers anyway.

(6, 7): If 6 and 7 are excluded, N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11. However, since N is divisible by both 2 and 3, it must be divisible by 6. Thus, (6, 7) cannot be the excluded numbers.
(7, 8): If 7 and 8 are excluded, N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11. This is possible.
(8, 9): If 8 and 9 are excluded, N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11. This is possible.
(9, 10): If 9 and 10 are excluded, N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11. This is possible.
(10, 11): If 10 and 11 are excluded, N is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This is possible.

Thus, 4 pairs are possible: (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11).

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
We have the following pairs (6,7), (7,8), (8,9), (9,10) and (10,11). We are looking for how many pairs where if the number N is not divisible by those two numbers, then N must be divisible by all other numbers from 2 to 11.

*   (6,7): If N is not divisible by 6 and 7, it must be divisible by 2,3,4,5,8,9,10,11. Since 6 = 2 * 3, N being divisible by 2 and 3 means N is divisible by 6, which contradicts the assumption that N is not divisible by 6. So, this is not a possible exception.
*   (7,8): If N is not divisible by 7 and 8, it must be divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,9,10,11. This is a possible exception.
*   (8,9): If N is not divisible by 8 and 9, it must be divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11. This is a possible exception.
*   (9,10): If N is not divisible by 9 and 10, it must be divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,11. This is a possible exception.
*   (10,11): If N is not divisible by 10 and 11, it must be divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. This is a possible exception.

Thus there are 4 possible pairs.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
The task is to find how many pairs (6,7), (7,8), (8,9), (9,10) and (10,11) can be the exception to the rule that N is divisible by all numbers between 2 and 11.

(6, 7): If N is not divisible by 6 and 7, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11. Since 6 = 2*3, this would require that if N is divisible by 2 and 3, it should be divisible by 6 as well, which is a contradiction.
(7, 8): If N is not divisible by 7 and 8, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11. There isn't any direct contradiction.
(8, 9): If N is not divisible by 8 and 9, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11. There isn't any direct contradiction.
(9, 10): If N is not divisible by 9 and 10, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11. There isn't any direct contradiction.
(10, 11): If N is not divisible by 10 and 11, then N must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. There isn't any direct contradiction.

Hence there are 4 possible cases.

Answer: D)
