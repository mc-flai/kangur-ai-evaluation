Reasoning: If a nobleman says "Of my two neighbors, one is a liar and one is a nobleman", it is true. If a liar says the same thing, it is false. Thus a liar must have two liars or two noblemen as his neighbors.
Consider alternating nobleman (N), liar (L), nobleman, etc. This arrangement satisfies the condition for noblemen, but not for liars, since their neighbours are always noblemen. So we need the neighbors of liars to be of the same type.
Consider two consecutive liars: L, L. Let's place a nobleman next to them: N, L, L, ?. In order for the last liar to be consistent, his other neighbor must also be a liar: N, L, L, L. This is not a valid arrangement.
The only valid arrangement is alternating N, L, N, L, .... In this case the number of Noblemen and Liars would be equal. However, it is possible to make an arrangement where there are pairs of Liars between Noblemen, say NLLNLL... Now a Noblemen is always flanked by one Noblemen and one liar and two liars are always flanked by Noblemen.
If we have "NLL" as our group, then the number of people in each group is 3.
2017 = 3 * 672 + 1. So we can have 672 groups of NLL and then one N. The total number of Noblemen = 673. The total number of Liars is 672 * 2 = 1344. Number of people = 673 + 1344 = 2017.
If we have "NL" as our group, then the number of people in each group is 2.
2017 = 2 * 1008 + 1. So we can have 1008 groups of NL and one N. The total number of Noblemen = 1009. The total number of Liars is 1008. But the statement "Of my two neighbours, one is a liar and one is a nobleman" will be false for every liar in this case.
If we have "N L L" as our repeating group, then number of Noblemen will be around 1/3 and number of Liars will be around 2/3.
The number of Liars would be double the number of Noblemen, so 2N + N = 2017, and 3N = 2017, so N = 2017 / 3 = 672.333 which means N = 672. L = 1345, so LLL and NN
Consider the string of "NLL". It has the property that every statement of "One liar and one nobleman as neighbor" is false for the liar, since they always have a liar, so they lie. And Nobleman has a liar and Nobleman next to them, so it's true, and nobleman tells the truth. Then the number of Noblemen is at most 2017 / 3. So we have N = 672 and L = 1345.

If the person is a liar, the two neighbors cannot be N, L since they always lie, so they have to be NN, LL.
If the person is a nobleman, the two neighbors must be N, L in some order.
Let N = number of noblemen. Then number of liars must be at least one.
Let's maximize the number of noblemen. If we have a L, it has to be LL. So consider an L pair.
Total people = Noblemen + 2*NumberOfLLs.
Let NumberOfLLs = x, and number of noblemen be y. We want to find the maximum number of noblemen, so maximize y such that y + 2x = 2017. If x = 0, then y = 2017. But this is impossible as Nobleman will not see a liar. If x = 1, y = 2015, If x = 2, y = 2013, and so on.
If we consider sequence of Noblemen NNN, then they will be together until 2 ends, and then a Liar LL to separate, NNNNNNN... L L NNN. If we have a sequence of noblemen, it is not possible.
But instead, consider N L L, we have an equal portion of LL.
Consider Noblemen=1 and Liars = 1344
Consider Noblemen=1683 and Liars = 334
So, consider alternating pattern Noblemen followed by 2 liars. NLLNLL
2017 = 3n+1. Then Noblemen = n+1. And n= (2017-1)/3, which comes to be 2016/3, or 672
Total Nobelman = 673.
Total Liars = 672*2 = 1344

Reasoning:
A nobleman must have one liar and one nobleman as neighbors, so N must be next to L and N
A liar must have either LL as his neighbor, or NN as his neighbor.
Since there must be over 1000 people, then try NLL as a set. Then the no. of sets would be 2017/3 is equal to around 672.33.
We consider a series of NLL. NLLNLLNLL....N at the very last.
Each block has 1N and 2 L. 2016 / 3 = 672.
We add an extra one nobleman for NLLNLL....N, so Nobelman counts come up to 673. The number of liars comes up to 1344. So
The max nobelmen on the island is 673 + all other noblemen is 670.
Therefore there is alternating.
672.  So lets check each liar must have LL. We consider set LLN then, LL LL LL and so on, then max Number of noble men will 673. If it doesn't add up, then lets consider 2Liars.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let $N$ be the number of noblemen and $L$ the number of liars. We are given that $N + L = 2017$.
The statement "Of my two neighbors, one is a liar and one is a nobleman" must be true if the person is a nobleman and false if the person is a liar. This means that a liar must have two liars or two noblemen as neighbors.
Consider an arrangement where every nobleman has a liar and a nobleman as neighbors, and every liar has two liars as neighbors. Such an arrangement is of the form $NLLNLLNLL...$
Let the number of such blocks of $NLL$ be $k$. Then the number of noblemen is $k$ and the number of liars is $2k$. Then we have $N + L = k + 2k = 3k = 2017$. However, 2017 is not divisible by 3. $2017 = 3 * 672 + 1$. So, we can have 672 blocks of $NLL$ and one additional person who is a nobleman.
This gives us $N = 672 + 1 = 673$ and $L = 2 * 672 = 1344$.
Then $N + L = 673 + 1344 = 2017$.
Another possible arrangement is alternating $NLNLNLNLNL$.
In this case, $N=L$.
Then number of Noblemen = Liars. But it must be false for Liars, meaning their neighbors must be of different types. But we have the neighbours are of different types in NLNL. So it's invalid.
$2017/2=1008.5$ which is wrong.
Suppose the liars tell the truth. Which can't happen. In order to maximize the noblemen, consider any arrangement with $N = 673$ and $L = 1344$. So the neighbours LL
There are two liars always next to one of the Noblemen.
If three consecutive people were of the same types, the Liars have to lie.
We have $N L L$ at a particular place.
$2017 = 3k + 1$
The statement has to satisfy that One is a liar and one is a nobleman for noblemen
673 sounds like a valid possibility. What if Nobelmen can be 670. If the Noblemen are 670 then Liars 1347

We are looking for the number near 670. So 670 could be the solution.
