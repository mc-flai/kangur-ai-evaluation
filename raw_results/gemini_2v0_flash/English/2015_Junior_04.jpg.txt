Reasoning:
First, calculate the total amount paid: 80 + 50 + 20 = 150 cents.
Then, determine the proportion each person paid:
Anna: 80/150
Beate: 50/150
Cindy: 20/150
Next, calculate how many biscuits each person should have received based on their proportion of payment:
Anna: (80/150) * 30 = 16
Beate: (50/150) * 30 = 10
Cindy: (20/150) * 30 = 4
Anna actually received 10 biscuits, but should have received 16. The question asks how many *more* biscuits she should have got, so we calculate 16 - 10 = 6.
