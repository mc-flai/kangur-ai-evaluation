Reasoning: The probability of picking a blue ball is the number of blue balls divided by the total number of balls.
A) 10/(10+8) = 10/18 = 5/9
B) 6/(6+4) = 6/10 = 3/5
C) 8/(8+6) = 8/14 = 4/7
D) 7/(7+7) = 7/14 = 1/2
E) 12/(12+9) = 12/21 = 4/7
Comparing these fractions, we have:
5/9 = 0.555...
3/5 = 0.6
4/7 = 0.5714...
1/2 = 0.5
Comparing these decimals, we see that 3/5 (from option B) is the largest.

Answer: B)
