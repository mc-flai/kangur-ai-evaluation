Reasoning:
Let's analyze the length of the rubber bands in both cases.
In the left picture: There are two straight segments of length 4 cm each. The curved parts consist of 4 portions that are each a quarter circle of radius 1 cm, so the total length of the curved sections is $4\cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2\pi r = 2\pi(1) = 2\pi$. The total length of the rubber band in the left picture is $2(4) + 2\pi = 8 + 2\pi$.
In the right picture: There are three straight segments, each with length 2 cm. The curved sections consist of 3 portions that are each a third of a circle of radius 1 cm, so the total length of the curved sections is $3\cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot 2\pi r = 2\pi(1) = 2\pi$. The total length of the rubber band in the right picture is $3(2) + 2\pi = 6 + 2\pi$.
The difference in length between the left picture and the right picture is $(8 + 2\pi) - (6 + 2\pi) = 2$ cm. Thus, the right picture is 2 cm shorter than the left picture. The closest option is E, because the perimeter should depend only on number of circles and radius.

If we have $n$ circles of the same radius $r$, then we will have $2\pi r$ in total. Number of straight lines can be either 2 or 3 circles.
For a row of $n$ circles the straight part has length $n2r$ and curved has length $2\pi r$.
Left picture: 3 circles + 3 circles. Straight part is $4r = 4(1) = 4$ cm on both side. We have $2r \pi = 2\pi$ for the curved part. $2r = 2(2r)$, and since diameter is 2, the length is $2 + 2 = 4 cm. Then the total length is $2*4 + 2\pi = 8 + 2\pi$.
Right Picture: Straight part has length 2r. Number of circles: 6, three are in the bottom so $2(2r)=6$. The curved part has length $2 \pi r = 2\pi cm$. The total length is $6+2\pi$.
$8+2\pi - (6 + 2\pi) = 2$.

There must be a mistake, since the length of rubber band must be equal in both cases if we only consider the outer boundary. The mistake is probably in the image or options.
In both configurations, the circular sections add up to the circumference of one tube, i.e. $\pi d = 2\pi$ cm.
In the first configuration, the straight sections add up to $4 \mathrm{cm}+4 \mathrm{cm}=8 \mathrm{cm}$. Hence the total length is $8+2\pi \mathrm{cm}$.
In the second configuration, the straight sections add up to $2+2+2 = 6 \mathrm{cm}$. Hence the total length is $6+2\pi \mathrm{cm}$.
Thus the rubber band in the second picture is 2cm shorter than the rubber band in the first picture.
The bands are not equally long.

Reasoning: Upon recalculating, the difference is 2. The options are all incorrect. The closest one is option E.
