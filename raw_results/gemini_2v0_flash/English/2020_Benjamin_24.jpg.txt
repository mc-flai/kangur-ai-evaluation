Reasoning:
Let's analyze the scales to find the relationship between the shapes.
From the first scale, we have: 1 square + 1 arrow = 1 triangle + 2 circles
From the second scale, we have: 3 squares = 1 triangle + 1 circle
We need to find out what equals 1 arrow + 2 squares.
From the first equation, we can isolate 1 arrow: arrow = triangle + 2 circles - square.
We want to find what balances arrow + 2 squares, so substitute arrow from the first equation:
arrow + 2 squares = (triangle + 2 circles - square) + 2 squares = triangle + 2 circles + square.
Now we check the options:
A) 4 triangles + 1 square : incorrect.
B) 3 triangles + 1 circle: incorrect.
C) 1 triangle + 3 circles + 1 square: matches our result.
D) 1 circle + 3 squares: incorrect.
E) 2 circles + 1 square: incorrect.
Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Answer: C)
