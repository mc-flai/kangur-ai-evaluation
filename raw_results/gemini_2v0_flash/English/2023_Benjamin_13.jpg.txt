Reasoning:
Let's analyze each person's statement and see if it leads to a contradiction.
- If Maria is telling the truth, Peter broke the window. This means Peter, Richard, and Tina are lying. If Peter is lying, it means that Richard didn't break the window. Since Richard is lying, he did break the window. This is a contradiction.
- If Peter is telling the truth, Richard broke the window. This means Maria, Richard and Tina are lying. Maria lying means it wasn't Peter. Richard lying means that he did break the window. Tina lying means that she did break the window. This is a contradiction since only one person broke the window.
- If Richard is telling the truth, he did not break the window. Then Maria, Peter, and Tina are lying. Maria lying means Peter didn't break the window. Peter lying means Richard didn't break the window. Tina lying means she did break the window. This is a contradiction.
- If Tina is telling the truth, she did not break the window. Then Maria, Peter, and Richard are lying. Maria lying means Peter didn't break the window. Peter lying means Richard didn't break the window. Richard lying means he did break the window. Therefore Richard is the only one who broke the window. This is a possible solution.

Therefore, Richard broke the window and Tina told the truth.
