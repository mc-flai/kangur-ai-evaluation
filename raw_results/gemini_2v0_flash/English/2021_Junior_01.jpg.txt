- In 2022, March 1st was a Tuesday, so the third Thursday was March 17th. Option A is correct.
- In 2023, March 1st was a Wednesday, so the third Thursday was March 16th. Option B is correct.
- In 2024, March 1st was a Friday, so the third Thursday was March 14th. Option C is correct.
- In 2025, March 1st was a Saturday, so the third Thursday was March 20th. Option D is correct.
- In 2026, March 1st was a Sunday, so the third Thursday was March 19th. Option E is correct.

Reasoning:
March 1, 2022, was a Tuesday.
March 1, 2023, was a Wednesday.
March 1, 2024, was a Friday (leap year).
March 1, 2025, was a Saturday.

2023: First Thursday was March 2. Third Thursday was March 16. (B) is correct.
2024: First Thursday was March 7. Third Thursday was March 21. (C) is incorrect, March 14.
