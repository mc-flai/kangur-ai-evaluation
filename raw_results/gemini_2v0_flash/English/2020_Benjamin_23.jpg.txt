Reasoning:
1. Start with all white circles (WWWW).
2. Touch one of the circles (e.g., top left). This changes it and its neighbors. We get (BBWB).
3. To get all circles to black, we can touch the bottom right circle, which would change it and its neighbors to (BBBB).
Therefore, touching two circles is sufficient to turn all the circles black.
