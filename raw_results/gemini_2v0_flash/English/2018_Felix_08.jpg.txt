Reasoning: The question asks which of the *4* pieces is left over. Options A, B, C, and D are all individual pieces. Option E is "C or D".
The image shows 4 jigsaw pieces and a "hole" that needs to be filled by 3 pieces. This means one of A, B, C, and D is the piece left over, and the other 3 pieces are needed.
Therefore, options A, B, C, and D are the possible pieces left over, making them potential correct answers.
However, option (E) says that C or D is the answer, meaning either C or D is left over and the other two pieces are needed to complete the jigsaw.
The instructions indicate that this is a single answer multiple choice questions. It is likely the case, then, that C or D are BOTH possible answers to choose among A, B, C and D as left over.
But if you pick A, B, C, or D separately, that means the other 3 were needed. But which were the other 3 needed?
Consider then, if C or D are the ONLY possible answers from the initial options A, B, C, and D, then only one piece is left over from them and the other 3 were used.
If either piece C or D is left over, that is a possible scenario.

Answer: E)
