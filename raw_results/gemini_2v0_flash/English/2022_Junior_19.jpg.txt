Reasoning:
Currently, there is one tree. We need to add more trees so that the number of trees on either side of each path is the same. Since there are 3 paths and one tree is already planted, we need each path to have the same number of trees. Let's denote by $n$ the number of trees on each side of each path. If we add 2 trees, then two paths will have one tree on one side and none on the other side. If we add 2 trees, then two paths will have one tree on one side and none on the other side.
Consider placing a tree at the intersection of two paths. If we add two trees to the park so the number of trees on either side of each path is the same, then let the number of trees be x.
path 1 has a tree, so x-1 trees are required.
path 2 has a tree, so x-1 trees are required.
path 3 has a tree, so x-1 trees are required.

Let's assume that after placing the additional trees, each of the three paths has two trees on each side of the path. Thus, the tree at the center contributes to each path.
We want to add trees such that each path has the same number of trees on each side of the path.
If we add two trees at intersections of the path, then two of the paths will have 1 tree on both sides. If we add two more trees, then all three paths have two trees. In this case, we need 2 * 3 = 6 trees in total to make it equal to 3.

If we add two trees at the locations near each side of the path so each path has equal number of trees, it is not symmetrical.
Consider the existing tree. Let n be the minimum number of additional trees needed. After adding n trees, each path must have the same number of trees.
Suppose each path has $k$ trees. Let $x_1, x_2, x_3$ be the number of additional trees that path 1, path 2, path 3 need respectively.
We want to find the minimum $n$ such that $1 + x_1 = 1 + x_2 = 1 + x_3 = k$. Therefore $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = k-1$.
Let $n = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 3(k-1)$.
$3 trees must be there. Suppose the total trees each path should have =3. Trees to add = 2
For the paths to have the same number of trees, each path must have either 1 or 2 or 3 trees on either side.
Since 1 tree is in the center, it affects all three paths. Therefore, if we add 2 trees in strategic positions such that two paths are balanced, then one path won't be. Therefore 2 trees will not do.
We consider three trees to balance the paths
If we add two more trees in addition to the existing one. Then 3 is the number.
If we add 2 trees, one can be used to balance two paths, but the other cannot.

Let each path have one tree on each side of the path. Then since there is already one tree in the centre, we need to add 2 additional trees to each path to have 3 trees.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The initial tree is located at the centre of the paths, hence all paths will include this. Thus to get an even number of trees, add two more, so that each path has two trees on each side. We can do it with two trees
Answer: B)
Reasoning: We need to find the minimum number of additional trees to plant so that each path has the same number of trees. Since there is already 1 tree, let's see what happens if we plant 2 additional trees. We can plant each tree along 2 separate paths such that each path has 1 tree other than the centre tree. Then each side has 1 tree. This configuration satisfies the condition. Thus the answer is 2.
Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There is one existing tree. To have the same number of trees on each path we need to add 2 trees. With these two trees, we will have a total of 3 trees, ensuring the condition is met. Thus, the answer is B.
Answer: B)
Reasoning: The question asks for the minimum number of trees to add so that each path has the SAME number of trees. The initial tree lies along all 3 paths, therefore if we add 2 strategically placed trees such that each additional tree also lies on 2 of the paths then we meet the conditions of the question. (I.e. if all paths have the same amount of trees. Since the original tree is already on all 3 paths). Therefore if the total number of trees along all three paths is the same, then the answer to the question will be B, which is 2.
Answer: B)
Reasoning: With one tree already in place. If we add two more trees, we can place each such that they are each on two paths. Now each path will have a total of 3 trees, fulfilling the requirement.
Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let's say we need x trees along each path. The tree at the center is along each path. So, we need to add x-1 additional trees to each path. Let's say x=3. Then each path needs 2 additional trees. We can accomplish this by adding one tree at the intersection of paths 1 and 2, and another at the intersection of paths 2 and 3. Then path 1 has 1+1 trees, path 2 has 1+1+1 trees, path 3 has 1+1 trees. This doesn't work.

If we add 2 trees: Plant one on path 1 and path 2. Plant the other on path 2 and path 3. Then path 1 has 2 trees, path 2 has 3 trees, and path 3 has 2 trees. So that doesn't work.

We need to strategically add trees such that the number of trees on each path is equal. Add 2 trees such that both lie at intersection of all the paths. Thus the solution is 2.

Answer: B)
