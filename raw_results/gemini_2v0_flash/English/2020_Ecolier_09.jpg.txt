Reasoning: I need to determine the arrangement of darker and lighter squares that can be seen when looking at the 3D structure from directly above. I can break the structure down into a grid view. The grid will be 4x6. The first row will have 2 light cubes and 4 empty squares. The second row will have 2 light squares, 1 dark square, and 3 empty squares. The third row will have 1 dark square, 1 light square, and 4 dark squares. The fourth row will have 2 dark squares, 2 light squares, and 2 empty squares. Looking at the options only Option C fits these observations.

Answer: C)
