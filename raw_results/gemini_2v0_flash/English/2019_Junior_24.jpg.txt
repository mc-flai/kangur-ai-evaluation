Reasoning:
Let $s$ be the side length of the square.
The radius of the circle is $r = 1$.
The center of the circle is at the midpoint of the base of the square.
Let the coordinates of the upper right vertex of the square be $(x, y)$.
Then $x = s/2$ and $y = s$.
Since the vertex lies on the circle, we have $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$.
Substituting the values, we get $(s/2)^2 + s^2 = 1^2$.
So, $s^2/4 + s^2 = 1$, which means $s^2(1/4 + 1) = 1$.
$s^2(5/4) = 1$, so $s^2 = 4/5$.
The area of the square is $s^2 = 4/5$.
