Reasoning:
The multiplication magic square uses the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50 and 100.
The products of the numbers in each row, column and diagonal are equal.
The first row has 20 and 1. Let's find the product of the first row: 20 * 1 = 20.
Now we know that the product of the numbers in each row, column and diagonal is 20.
The third column has the numbers 1 and ?. Therefore, 1 * ? = 20, so the number must be 20. But 20 is already used in the first row so the product is not 20. The product of the column, row and diagonal is not 20.
Let the magic product be 'p'. We know that the first row has 20 and 1 so let the third number in the first row be 'x'. Therefore, 20 * 1 * x = p.
Also the first column must have the same product 'p'. The column has 20 at the first position, therefore the product of the remaining 2 entries in the column must be x.
We have the entries 20 1 and ?. The numbers allowed are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50 and 100.
The numbers we have are: 20, 1. Let the middle entry be 'a'. The question mark box is in the (3,3) place.
If the magic product is 1000, then 20 * 50 * 1 = 1000. The first row can be 20 * 5 * 10 = 1000, or 20 * 1 * 50 = 1000.
The main diagonal is 20 * ? * ? = p. Then 20 * 5 * 10 = 1000, or 20 * 1 * 50 = 1000.
Also, 20 * 50 * 1 = 1000. In this case, if 20 is at (1,1) position, 1 is at (1,2) position, the (1,3) position must be 50. The product for each column, row and diagonal is the same, thus 1000.

20 1 50
100 x y
z w ?

20 * 1 * 50 = 1000
20 * 100 * 5 = 1000
20 * 1 * 50 = 1000
Then it must be 5.

20   1  50
5  10  25
x    y  4

20 * 10 * x = 1000
Then consider the entries available. 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50 and 100.
20*1*50 = 1000
Let the middle entry be 5. Then we can check
20   1  50
100  5   20
x   y   z

Reasoning: The numbers are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100. We have 20 and 1. Let 'x' be the element in the cell with the question mark. Since each row, column, and diagonal must have the same product we can find a product equal to 100.
The row starts with 20 and 1, so it gives 20 * x * y = product. The second row product gives: a*b*? = product. Since 20 * 5 =100. Then, consider the column with 1. We have
1 and ? thus can result as 5 in row and must be 5. So it may be 20. But, we can have the diagonals resulting as constant value. 
If we put 5, the row ends, there is nothing.

Reasoning: Let's call the unknown number x.
We know the numbers are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50 and 100.
The product of the first row is 20 * 1 * a = p. p is the product of each row, column, and diagonals.
Since the middle number of the top row is 1, that column must have all number whose products also equal p. Let the number below 1 be 'b', and x is the number we are trying to find.
The first column must also multiply to p. Then the number after 20 = c.

Row 1: 20, 1, a
column 2: 1, b, x
Thus it may be 4

If the product is 1000: First row should be 20 5 100

Reasoning: The product of each row, column, and diagonal should be equal. We are given the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100.
We are given two of the numbers in the square: 20 and 1. Since this is a multiplication magic square, we are looking for the product to be the same in each row, column, and diagonal.
Let the numbers in the first row be 20, 1, x.
Let the numbers in the second column be 1, y, z.
Since we have a multiplication magic square, we can look for the middle number in our list of available numbers. In this case, the number 5.
Then it must be five.

If ? is 4, then one possible result is:
20   1
? x  y and product of last elements is greater than result product

Let the magic number be product from 1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50,100 elements = Product p
20     1    x

The closest thing in the answer is the multiple of it is 5.
