Reasoning:
The sum of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20. Since the sum of the numbers in each box is the same, each box must have a sum of 20 / 2 = 10.
We want to know which number must be in the box with the number 4. Let's consider the possible pairings with 4 to achieve a sum of 10.
- If 4 is paired with 6, the sum is 10, and the other box must contain 2, 3, and 5, which sum to 10. So {4, 6} and {2, 3, 5} is a valid solution.
- We could also try {4, x, y}, then x+y = 6. From the remaining numbers (2, 3, 5, 6), possible pairs summing to 6 are {2, 4}, {3, 3}. But if we pair 4 with 2, x+y must equal 6, then y can only be 4. If we have a pair of {3,3}, but we only have one 3. Since we already used 4 in the pair {4, x, y}, it is not possible for x+y = 6.
In the box with 4, we need to find which number must be together.
Looking at the solution we found previously {4, 6} and {2, 3, 5}, we see that 6 must be with 4.
