Reasoning:
Let the distance traveled by the king in one hour be $d = 5 \text{ km}$.
The time taken by the first messenger to reach the castle is $t_1 = \frac{d}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ minutes}$.
After another hour, the king has traveled an additional 5 km. So the total distance traveled by the king is $2d = 10 \text{ km}$.
The time taken by the second messenger to reach the castle is $t_2 = \frac{2d}{10} = \frac{10}{10} = 1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}$.
The first messenger starts at $t = 1 \text{ hour}$ and arrives at the castle at $t = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours}$.
The second messenger starts at $t = 2 \text{ hours}$ and arrives at the castle at $t = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours}$.
The time difference between the arrival of two consecutive messengers is $3 - 1.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ minutes}$.

Alternatively:
Let $d$ be the distance from the castle to the point where the king is when he sends the first messenger. Then $d = 5 \text{ km/h} \cdot 1 \text{ h} = 5 \text{ km}$.
The time for the first messenger to return to the castle is $t_1 = \frac{5 \text{ km}}{10 \text{ km/h}} = 0.5 \text{ h} = 30 \text{ min}$.  So the first messenger arrives at the castle 1 hour + 30 min = 90 min after the king leaves.
After another hour, the king is $5 \text{ km} + 5 \text{ km} = 10 \text{ km}$ from the castle.
The time for the second messenger to return to the castle is $t_2 = \frac{10 \text{ km}}{10 \text{ km/h}} = 1 \text{ h} = 60 \text{ min}$.  So the second messenger arrives at the castle 2 hours + 60 min = 180 min after the king leaves.
The difference in arrival times is $180 \text{ min} - 90 \text{ min} = 90 \text{ min}$.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
Let the first messenger be sent after 1 hour. The distance is 5 km. The time taken for the messenger to reach the castle is 5/10 = 0.5 hours. So the first messenger reaches the castle after 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.
The second messenger is sent after 2 hours. The distance is 10 km. The time taken for the messenger to reach the castle is 10/10 = 1 hour. So the second messenger reaches the castle after 2 + 1 = 3 hours.
The difference between the two arrival times is 3 - 1.5 = 1.5 hours = 90 minutes.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
Let the time be $t$ hours since the king left. The distance of the king from the castle is $5t$.
The king sends a messenger every hour.
The first messenger is sent at $t=1$. The distance is $5(1)=5$ km. Time taken to reach the castle is $5/10 = 0.5$ hours. Arrival time is $1+0.5 = 1.5$ hours.
The second messenger is sent at $t=2$. The distance is $5(2)=10$ km. Time taken to reach the castle is $10/10 = 1$ hour. Arrival time is $2+1 = 3$ hours.
The difference is $3 - 1.5 = 1.5$ hours $= 90$ minutes.
Answer: D)
Reasoning:
The king sends messengers every hour. Let the first messenger be sent at time $t=1$ hour. The distance from the castle is $5 \cdot 1 = 5$ km. The time taken by the messenger to travel back to the castle is $5/10 = 0.5$ hours. Therefore, the first messenger arrives at the castle at $1 + 0.5 = 1.5$ hours.
The second messenger is sent at time $t=2$ hours. The distance from the castle is $5 \cdot 2 = 10$ km. The time taken by the messenger to travel back to the castle is $10/10 = 1$ hour. Therefore, the second messenger arrives at the castle at $2 + 1 = 3$ hours.
The time difference between the arrivals is $3 - 1.5 = 1.5$ hours $= 1.5 \cdot 60 = 90$ minutes.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
Let the first messenger be sent after 1 hour. The distance is 5 km. Time to return is 5/10 = 0.5 hrs. Arrival at castle is 1.5 hrs.
Second messenger is sent after 2 hrs. The distance is 10 km. Time to return is 10/10 = 1 hr. Arrival at castle is 3 hrs.
Difference is 3 - 1.5 = 1.5 hours = 90 mins

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
After the king travels for one hour, he is 5 km away from the castle. The first messenger will take 5 km / (10 km/h) = 0.5 hours to return to the castle. So the first messenger arrives at the castle 1.5 hours after the king left.
After the king travels for two hours, he is 10 km away from the castle. The second messenger will take 10 km / (10 km/h) = 1 hour to return to the castle. So the second messenger arrives at the castle 3 hours after the king left.
The difference in time between their arrivals is 3 - 1.5 = 1.5 hours = 90 minutes.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
The king sends the first messenger at t=1 hour. The distance is 5km. The time for the messenger to get back is 5/10 = 0.5 hour. The first messenger arrives at 1.5 hours.
The king sends the second messenger at t=2 hours. The distance is 10km. The time for the messenger to get back is 10/10 = 1 hour. The second messenger arrives at 3 hours.
The difference is 3 - 1.5 = 1.5 hours = 90 minutes.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
Let's analyze the situation. The king travels at 5 km/h and sends a messenger back every hour who travels at 10 km/h.
The first messenger is sent after 1 hour. At this time, the king has traveled 5 km. The messenger takes 5/10 = 0.5 hours to reach the castle. So, the first messenger arrives at the castle after 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.
The second messenger is sent after 2 hours. At this time, the king has traveled 10 km. The messenger takes 10/10 = 1 hour to reach the castle. So, the second messenger arrives at the castle after 2 + 1 = 3 hours.
The difference in arrival times is 3 - 1.5 = 1.5 hours, which is equal to 90 minutes.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
After 1 hour, the king is 5km away. The first messenger travels back at 10 km/h, so it takes 0.5 hours to reach the castle. The time when first messenger arrives is 1+0.5 = 1.5 hours.
After 2 hours, the king is 10km away. The second messenger travels back at 10 km/h, so it takes 1 hour to reach the castle. The time when the second messenger arrives is 2+1=3 hours.
The difference between their arrival times is 3 - 1.5 = 1.5 hours = 90 minutes.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
The first messenger starts after 1 hour. The king has traveled 5 km. Time for the messenger to arrive at the castle is 5km / 10kmph = 0.5 hours. Therefore, the first messenger reaches the castle in 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.
The second messenger starts after 2 hours. The king has traveled 10km. Time for the messenger to arrive at the castle is 10km / 10 kmph = 1 hour. Therefore, the second messenger reaches the castle in 2+1= 3 hours.
The time difference is 3 - 1.5 = 1.5 hours = 90 mins.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
First messenger is sent after 1 hour, the distance is 5km. Time taken to reach the castle is 5/10 = 0.5h. Total time is 1.5 hours.
Second messenger is sent after 2 hours, the distance is 10km. Time taken to reach the castle is 10/10 = 1h. Total time is 3 hours.
Difference is 3-1.5 = 1.5 hours = 90 minutes.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
First messenger sent after 1 hour. Distance from castle is 5 km. Time taken to reach castle = 5/10 = 0.5 hours. Total time = 1.5 hours.
Second messenger sent after 2 hours. Distance from castle is 10 km. Time taken to reach castle = 10/10 = 1 hour. Total time = 3 hours.
Time difference = 3 - 1.5 = 1.5 hours = 90 minutes.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
The first messenger is sent after 1 hour. The distance from castle is 5 km. Time to return to castle is 5/10=0.5 hr. So, arrival time is 1+0.5 = 1.5 hrs.
The second messenger is sent after 2 hours. The distance from castle is 10 km. Time to return to castle is 10/10 = 1 hr. So, arrival time is 2+1 = 3 hrs.
Difference is 3-1.5 = 1.5 hrs = 90 minutes.
Answer: D)
Reasoning:
The first messenger starts after 1 hour. The distance to castle is 5 km. The time to get there is 5/10 = 0.5 hours. Arrival at castle is 1.5 hours.
The second messenger starts after 2 hours. The distance to castle is 10 km. The time to get there is 10/10 = 1 hour. Arrival at castle is 3 hours.
Difference is 3 - 1.5 = 1.5 hours = 90 mins

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
First messenger: Sent after 1 hour, Distance: 5km, Time to castle: 5/10=0.5h, Arrives at 1.5 h
Second messenger: Sent after 2 hours, Distance: 10km, Time to castle: 10/10=1h, Arrives at 3h
Difference: 3-1.5 = 1.5h = 90 min

Answer: D)
