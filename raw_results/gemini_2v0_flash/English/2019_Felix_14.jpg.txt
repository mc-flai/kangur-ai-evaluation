Reasoning: The question asks which figure needs the least amount of colour, which translates to which figure has the smallest surface area. The figure with the least amount of surface area would be the one where most of the cube faces are touching each other, therefore reducing the amount of exposed colored surface. Comparing all five figures, figure (A) has the least amount of faces that are hidden due to touching, as no cube is stacked over another. Hence, it has the largest surface area. Figure (B) has the most faces touching. Figure (C), (D) and (E) are somewhere in the middle. Therefore, figure (B) needs the least amount of color.

Answer: B)
