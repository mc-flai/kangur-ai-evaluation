Reasoning:
The image shows a rectangle divided into three equal rectangles. We are asked to find the ratio of the side lengths of the white rectangle. From the problem definition and image, the white rectangle is one of the three equal rectangles that make up the larger rectangle. Let's assume the width of each of the three equal rectangles is 'w' and the height is 'h'. Therefore, the width of the large rectangle is 3w, and the height of the large rectangle is h. The white rectangle has dimensions of w and h.
Thus the ratio of the sides of the white rectangle is w:h. Since the length of the whole rectangle is 3w and the height is h, we see that the ratio we want is 1:3.
However, 1:3 is not one of the answers. Since the problem said that three equal rectangles can be seen, each with widths x, the entire rectangle's width would be 3x, and its height would be x. The question is, what's the ratio of the white rectangle? Then, we see that the width of each equal rectangle is x, and the height is 1x. The ratio of the length of one of the rectangles will be x:2x. So this isn't it.

The full length of the rectangle is the sum of the lengths of the three small rectangles. We'll let the short side of the small rectangle be x, then the width of the larger rectangle will be 3x. The height of the large rectangle is x. So the dimensions of the small rectangle are x by x. The rectangle is also equally split into three separate rectangles, each with equal size. Therefore, the side lengths of the rectangles are width: 1 unit and the height is 3 units. Therefore, the ratio of the small rectangle should be 1:3. But it is not an option in the answers.

We will look at the larger rectangle:
if we call the width of each of the small rectangle x and the height y, then we are asking what the ratio between x and y is. Since each of the three rectangles is equal in size, it must be that width to height will be in the form x to 3x/ something. But since the three rectangle height is unchanged across each rectangle it must mean x to 3x ratio, which is 1:3 ratio.
However, if we imagine instead, there are four rectangles with the same length and the large rectangle had the aspect of width 4x and height of y. In each case, we are asking for the ratio in width to height. Say width: x and the larger width: z.
So, consider x to 3x the width to length in these three rectangle
width is 3x long. So what the other side is.
Ratio of width to height is width / height : so 3 / x . SO 3x / x?
In that case

I misread. "How big is the ratio of the side lengths of the white rectangle?". It is asking for the width/length. So the total large rectangle. We just want the ratio width and h.
Width is "1 of the small rectangles". The length would be 1: 3. So is it 2:3. Its not.

The correct ratio should be 1 : 3. My calculations show it should be none of those.

Reasoning: The image is split into three equal rectangles. We need the ratio of a small rectangles' length to its height. The large rectangle's length is three times the small rectangle's length. Therefore, if we call the small side "1", the long side will be "3", and that side is length. However none of those solutions is 1:3. The closest match is A, 1:2, where the big rectangle is twice the height, 2x.
