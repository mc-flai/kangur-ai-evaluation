Reasoning:
The cards are (1,4), (2,5), (3,6).
We need to find the number of different sums.

1+2+3 = 6
1+2+6 = 9
1+5+3 = 9
1+5+6 = 12
4+2+3 = 9
4+2+6 = 12
4+5+3 = 12
4+5+6 = 15

The different sums are 6, 9, 12, 15.
Therefore, there are 4 different sums.
Since 4 is not an option, the correct answer is (E).

Answer: E)
