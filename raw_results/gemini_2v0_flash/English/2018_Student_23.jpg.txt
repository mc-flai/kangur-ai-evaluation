Reasoning:
Let's analyze each case:
1. Suppose A is lying. Then A is either the tallest or the smallest. If A is the tallest, then C is also telling the truth. If A is the smallest, then D is also telling the truth. Since exactly one person is lying, A cannot be lying.
2. Suppose B is lying. Then B is the smallest. Thus, D is also telling the truth, which is not possible.
3. Suppose C is lying. Then C is not the tallest. A's statement is true, which means A is neither tallest nor smallest. B's statement is true, which means B is not the smallest. D's statement is true, which means D is the smallest. So we have A not tallest nor smallest, B not smallest, C not tallest, and D smallest. Since exactly one of them is lying, this case is possible. Therefore, since C is lying and D is the smallest, A or B is the tallest.
4. Suppose D is lying. Then D is not the smallest. A's statement is true, which means A is neither the tallest nor the smallest. B's statement is true, which means B is not the smallest. C's statement is true, which means C is the tallest. In this case, A, B, and C are all telling the truth, which is impossible.

From the analysis above, only the case when C is lying is possible. In this case, C is not the tallest, D is the smallest, A is neither the tallest nor smallest, and B is not the smallest. Since C is not the tallest, the tallest person must be either A or B. However, the only lie is that C claims he is tallest. Therefore, the others are telling the truth and C cannot be the tallest. If C is the liar then statements A, B, and D are all truthful statements, which implies that A is neither the tallest nor smallest, B is not the smallest, and D is the smallest. Because one of the statements has to be a lie, the only possibility for the tallest person to be is C, as if any of the other lies were said the statements wouldn't be consistent.

Reasoning:
Assume that A is the liar. Then A is either the tallest or the smallest.
If A is the tallest, then C is also telling the truth, so there would be 2 liars. Contradiction.
If A is the smallest, then D is also telling the truth, so there would be 2 liars. Contradiction.

Assume that B is the liar. Then B is the smallest, so D is also telling the truth, which is not possible.

Assume that D is the liar. Then D is not the smallest.
A: I am neither the tallest nor the smallest. (True)
B: I am not the smallest. (True)
C: I am the tallest. (True)
There would be only 1 tallest, but all other height differences are possible. So exactly one liar is possible.

Assume that C is the liar. Then C is not the tallest.
A: I am neither the tallest nor the smallest. (True)
B: I am not the smallest. (True)
D: I am the smallest. (True)

C is the only one that lied. Therefore, D is the smallest.

If C is the liar, we can deduce C cannot be the tallest. Since A cannot be the tallest or smallest, B cannot be the smallest, and D is the smallest, either A or B is the tallest. Let's say A is the tallest, then A is lying, which means C is telling the truth. And this case won't satisfy exactly one liar. Therefore, A is not the tallest.

Since A is not the tallest or smallest, B cannot be the smallest, and D is the smallest, we can deduce that B must be the tallest in this case. Therefore, C lied, and B is the tallest.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Assume A is the liar: A is the tallest or the smallest. If A is the tallest, C is also telling the truth, making them both liars. Impossible. If A is the smallest, D is also telling the truth, making them both liars. Impossible.
Assume B is the liar: B is the smallest. D is also telling the truth, making them both liars. Impossible.
Assume D is the liar: D is NOT the smallest. A, B and C are telling the truth. Impossible, as C being the tallest makes A a liar too.
Assume C is the liar: C is NOT the tallest. A, B and D are telling the truth. A is neither the tallest nor the smallest. B is not the smallest. D is the smallest. Thus, either A or B is the tallest. If A is the tallest, then A lies, so C is truthful.
So B must be the tallest.

Final Answer: C)
Answer: C)
Reasoning:
If A is lying, A is the tallest or the smallest. If A is the tallest, C is also telling the truth. Contradiction. If A is the smallest, D is also telling the truth. Contradiction.
If B is lying, B is the smallest. So D is also telling the truth. Contradiction.
If C is lying, C is not the tallest. A, B, and D are telling the truth. A is not tallest or smallest. B is not the smallest. D is the smallest. So B is the tallest. This is a possibility.
If D is lying, D is not the smallest. A, B, and C are telling the truth. This is a contradiction, since only one person can be the tallest, so A can't be middle and C be the tallest, if we consider their relation.
Therefore, B is the tallest.

Final Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let's analyze each statement.
A: I am neither the tallest nor the smallest.
B: I am not the smallest.
C: I am the tallest.
D: I am the smallest.

Case 1: A is lying. Then A is either the tallest or the smallest.
If A is the tallest, then C is also telling the truth, which is not possible since only one person lies.
If A is the smallest, then D is also telling the truth, which is not possible.

Case 2: B is lying. Then B is the smallest. Then D is also telling the truth, which is not possible.

Case 3: C is lying. Then C is not the tallest. A, B, and D are telling the truth.
A is neither the tallest nor the smallest.
B is not the smallest.
D is the smallest.
Since C is not the tallest, and D is the smallest, and A is neither the tallest nor the smallest, B must be the tallest. This works.

Case 4: D is lying. Then D is not the smallest. A, B, and C are telling the truth.
This is impossible because if C is the tallest, then A can't be not tallest or smallest.
Therefore, C is lying, and B is the tallest.

Final Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let's analyze each case to see which is the tallest based on who is lying.

* **If A is lying:** A is either the tallest or the smallest. If A is the tallest, then C is also telling the truth (since C claims to be the tallest), contradicting the "exactly one lie" condition. If A is the smallest, then D is also telling the truth (since D claims to be the smallest), again contradicting the "exactly one lie" condition. So, A cannot be the liar.
* **If B is lying:** B is the smallest. Then D is also telling the truth (since D claims to be the smallest), contradicting the "exactly one lie" condition. So, B cannot be the liar.
* **If C is lying:** C is NOT the tallest. A, B, and D are telling the truth. A is neither the tallest nor the smallest. B is not the smallest. D is the smallest. Since C is not the tallest, and D is the smallest, A is in the middle, B is neither smallest and not middle, so B must be the tallest. This scenario is consistent with exactly one lie.
* **If D is lying:** D is NOT the smallest. A, B, and C are telling the truth. This means C is the tallest. A is neither the tallest nor the smallest. B is not the smallest. However, since C is the tallest, A cannot be "neither the tallest nor the smallest" as that leaves no space for anyone between A and C. This means there are two trues that lead to contradiction. The case is invalid.

Only when C is lying is it possible to have exactly one lie. In that scenario, B is the tallest. Thus the answer is C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
If A is lying, then A is the tallest or the smallest.
- If A is the tallest, then C is also telling the truth (I am the tallest). This means there are two people lying, violating the condition that exactly one person lies.
- If A is the smallest, then D is also telling the truth (I am the smallest). This means there are two people lying, violating the condition that exactly one person lies.
If B is lying, then B is the smallest. In that case, D is also telling the truth (I am the smallest). This means there are two people lying, violating the condition that exactly one person lies.
If C is lying, then C is not the tallest. Then A, B, and D are telling the truth. Thus,
- A is neither the tallest nor the smallest
- B is not the smallest
- D is the smallest
Since A is not the tallest or smallest, B is not the smallest, D is the smallest, it must be the case that B is the tallest.
If D is lying, then D is not the smallest. Thus A, B, and C are telling the truth. However, A states they are neither the smallest nor tallest.

Therefore, the only possibility is that C is lying and B is the tallest.

Final Answer: C)
Answer: C)
Reasoning:
A: I am neither the tallest nor the smallest.
B: I am not the smallest.
C: I am the tallest.
D: I am the smallest.

One of them is lying.

If A lies, then A is the tallest or the smallest.
If A is the tallest, C is also telling the truth. Impossible.
If A is the smallest, D is also telling the truth. Impossible.

If B lies, then B is the smallest.
Then D is also telling the truth. Impossible.

If C lies, then C is not the tallest.
Then A, B, and D are telling the truth.
A is not tallest or smallest.
B is not the smallest.
D is the smallest.
This means B is the tallest.
This is a possible solution.

If D lies, then D is not the smallest.
Then A, B, and C are telling the truth.
But A is not the tallest or smallest, and C is the tallest. This is impossible.

Therefore C is lying, and B is the tallest.

Final Answer: C)
