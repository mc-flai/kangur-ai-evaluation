Reasoning: The head and tail can be the same color (3 options), or different colors. If they're the same color, there are 3 choices, and the wing can be either of the other two remaining colors, thus 3*2=6 possibilities. If the head and tail are different colors, then there are 3 options for head, 2 for tail, and 1 for wing, so 3*2*1=6 options. In total we have 6+6=12.
