Reasoning: The path needs to be closed when folding the net into a cuboid. We can visually trace each path and see if it forms a continuous loop across the faces. Option (A) has horizontal lines, which are not going to connect on adjacent faces properly, so this option can be ruled out. Option (B) is similar in that the path is not continuous and parts don't connect properly. Option (C) does not seem to connect to other parts and can be ruled out. In option (D) the curves and lines seem to connect around the faces to create a closed path. However, after folding, option (E) seems to be the most likely since the curves connect to the edges that would meet when the cuboid is constructed.

Answer: E)
