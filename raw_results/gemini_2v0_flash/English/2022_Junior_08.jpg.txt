Reasoning: The question states that Sonja spent half the amount of time on two of the apps and the same amount of time on the other two apps. Looking at the original image, we can denote the time spent on the apps as a, b, c, and d, where a > b > c > d. The new times will be a/2, b/2, c, and d, or any other combination of two of the app times halved and the other two unchanged.
Looking at the answer options, we need to find one that has two of the bars halved in length compared to the original diagram, while the other two remain the same. Visually comparing with option A, two of the bars appear to have been halved, and the other two remain the same.
Thus, option A is likely the answer.

Answer: A)
