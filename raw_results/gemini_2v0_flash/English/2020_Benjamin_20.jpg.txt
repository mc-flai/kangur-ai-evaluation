Reasoning: The volume of water in vase I is 4 liters, in vase II it is 3 liters and in vase III it is 4 liters. Also the vases seem to be of the same size when seen from the front. This implies that the vases have different cross sectional areas from above. Since vase II has the least volume and all vases have the same height, its cross section will have to be the smallest when viewed from above. Also, the cross sectional area from above of vase I and vase III should be the same. This is consistent with option E.

Answer: E)
