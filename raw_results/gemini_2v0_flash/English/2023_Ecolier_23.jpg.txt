Reasoning:
Let the number in the circle with the question mark be x.
According to the question, the sum of the numbers in the two adjacent circles should be equal to the number written between them.
So, x + the number to the left of x = 9, and x + the number to the right of x = 6. We have the following.
The number to the left of x = 9 - x.
The number to the right of x = 6 - x.
We are given that the numbers used are 1 to 7. Therefore, we can deduce the equation:
The two adjacent circles to the number "9" contain 8 and x. Therefore, 8 + x = 9, implying that x = 1.
Also, x + the number next to it equals 6. Since x = 1, then 1 + (number to the right of x) = 6, thus the number on the right is 5.
Therefore, since x = 1, then the number in the circle with the question mark is 1.
