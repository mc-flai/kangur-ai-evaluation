Reasoning: The distance of straight lines between X and Y are the same for all the options. We need to estimate the length of the arc segments in each option. In options A, B, C and E, two arcs pass through the second circle from the center while in option D only one arc passes through the second circle. The first arc for A, B, C and E are identical, hence, the overall length of option D will be shorter than A, B, C and E. Option D has the shortest path among all paths. Option A has both arcs in the outermost circle compared to the other options; option B has one in the outermost circle, option C has one in the outermost circle, option D has only the inner circles, and option E also has one in the outermost circle. Comparing A, B, C, and E, we can see that A is the longest.

Answer: A)
