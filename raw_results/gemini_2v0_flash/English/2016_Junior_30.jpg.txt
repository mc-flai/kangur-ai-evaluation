Reasoning:
Let's consider the number of handshakes that can occur. The number of handshakes must be less than or equal to 2015. P2015 shook hands with 2015 people. This means everyone else shook hands with them.
P1 shook hands with 1 person.
P2 shook hands with 2 people.
...
P2015 shook hands with 2015 people.
The total number of people is 2016. P1 to P2015 all shook the number of hands corresponding to their system number.
Since P2015 shook hands with 2015 people, he shook hands with everyone except himself. Therefore, P2015 shook hands with P1, P2, ..., P2014, and P2016.
Also, P1 shook 1 hand. This person must have been P2015.
Now consider P2. He shook hands with 2 people. One of them must have been P2015. The other person must have been P2014 (since they shook hands with 2014 people).
We continue this pattern. Each person shakes hands with P2015.
We look for the number of handshakes of P2016. We know that P2015 shook hands with 2015 people including P2016. Also, P1 shook hands with P2015 only.
So P2016 shook hands with P1, P2, ..., P2015.
The only person that could have potentially NOT shaken P2016's hand is P2015. However, we know that P2015 shook hands with everyone from P1 to P2014 and also P2016. Therefore P2016 shook hands with P1, P2, ..., P2015. That is 2015 people.
So P2016 shook hands with 1008 people.
The solution to this problem can be tricky. We can denote the number of people who shake hands with P2016 as x. Each person from P1 to P2015 shakes a unique number of hands. The maximum number of handshakes possible is 2015. The question is asking how many people did P2016 shake hands with. Consider P1 shakes hands with 1 person and P2015 shakes hands with 2015.
We notice that Person 1 and 2015 must have shook each other's hands. This leads us to conclude that P2016 must have shook hands with everyone else (2015). Now think about why that statement can't be true.
Let's consider a smaller example. If there are 6 people P1 to P6 and P1-P5 have shaken handshakes equal to their number, then P6 handshakes would be 3. P6 shakes hands with P2, P3, P4, then this would have been P2+P1 = P3. 1 + 2015 =2016, this indicates that the number of handshake will be 2016/2 = 1008.

Answer: (D)
Reasoning:
The question asks how many people P2016 shook hands with. We know P1 shook 1 hand, and P2015 shook 2015 hands. The key insight is that the number of handshakes is paired so that for any person P_i with i < 1008, there will exist P_j with j > 1008, i+j=2016. Thus, the number of people who shake hands with P2016 is 1008.

Answer: (D)
Reasoning:
Let's try to reason this out. If P1 shook 1 hand, and P2 shook 2 hands, and so on, then P2015 shook 2015 hands.

Consider the fact that P1 shook one hand, and P2015 shook 2015 hands.

If P2015 shook 2015 hands, then P2015 shook hands with everyone else except himself.

The fact that everyone except P2016 shook a different number of hands can be important. P2015 shook hands with everyone, so P2016 is among those hands. P1 shook one hand, and that must be P2015.

P2016 shook hands with every person i where 1 <= i <= 2015. But we need to consider if P_i shook hands with P_2016. Since P2015 shook everyone's hand. P1 shook P2015's hand. So P2016 shook P1's hand because P2015 shook everyone's hand.
The answer should be half of the number of participants.

Answer: (D)
Reasoning:
Let $H_i$ be the number of handshakes of person $P_i$. We are given that $H_i = i$ for $i = 1, 2, \dots, 2015$. We want to find $H_{2016}$.

Consider the total number of people to be $n = 2016$. The maximum number of handshakes possible is $n-1 = 2015$. Since $P_{2015}$ shook hands with 2015 people, they shook hands with everyone else except themselves. Also, $P_1$ shook hands with only 1 person. So $P_1$ must have shaken hands with $P_{2015}$. In other words, if $P_i$ and $P_j$ shook hands with each other, it counts as one handshake, but it counts for both people.

Let's consider the number of handshakes that the 2016th person shook.
If $P_i$ shakes hands with $P_{2016}$, we have to see who the 2016th person could shake hands with. Since we know that each number from 1 to 2015 has been already used to represent how many handshakes each of the other 2015 people shook, we just need to figure out who among the 2015 people shook hands with. P2016 can't shake hands with P2015 because P2015 shake hands with everyone else.

The total number of people in the party is 2016. Each number from 1 to 2015 represents the exact number of handshakes the person shakes, so, the average will be between 1007 and 1008
The number of handshake will have to be 1008 in order for there to be parity.

Answer: (D)
Reasoning:
Let n = 2016. We are given that person P_i shakes exactly i hands for i = 1 to 2015. We want to find the number of hands that P_2016 shakes. Let this number be x.

P_2015 shook hands with everyone except himself.
P_1 shook hands with exactly one person, so P_1 must have shaken hands with P_2015.
P_2014 shook hands with 2014 people. These people must be everyone except himself and P_1.
P_2 shook hands with two people. Since he didn't shake hands with P_1, he must have shaken hands with P_2015 and P_2014.

Consider the pair (i, 2016-i). P_i shakes i hands and P_(2016-i) shakes 2016-i hands.

If i + (2016 - i) = 2016, then the number of hands P_2016 shook must be 1008.
