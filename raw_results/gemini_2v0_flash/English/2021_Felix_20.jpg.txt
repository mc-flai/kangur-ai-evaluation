Reasoning: The small cog has 8 teeth and the large cog has 16 teeth. When the small cog makes one full turn, the large cog will rotate half a turn.
The small cog's black tooth is initially at the point of contact. After one full turn, the black tooth of the small cog will be back at the point of contact.
The large cog's black tooth is initially two teeth clockwise from the point of contact. After half a turn (8 teeth), the black tooth will be 8 teeth away from its original position. That means the black tooth will be at 6 teeth clockwise from the point of contact. Thus, the large cog's black tooth will be 6 teeth clockwise from the point of contact. Looking at the answer options, only option (D) has both conditions.

Answer: D)
