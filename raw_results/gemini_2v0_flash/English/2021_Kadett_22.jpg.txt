Reasoning: Let the original fraction be $\frac{n}{d}$. The new fraction is $\frac{1.4n}{x d}$, where $x$ is the factor by which the denominator is multiplied after the decrease. We want the new fraction to be double the original, so $\frac{1.4n}{x d} = 2\frac{n}{d}$. We can cancel out $\frac{n}{d}$, giving us $\frac{1.4}{x} = 2$. Thus $x = \frac{1.4}{2} = 0.7$. This means the denominator is 70% of the original. Therefore, the denominator must be decreased by 30%.
