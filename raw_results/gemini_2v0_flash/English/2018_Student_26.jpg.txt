Reasoning: Let the point where the ball hits side AD be at a distance x from vertex A. We can unfold the billiard table to trace the path of the ball as a straight line. Let the width of the table be a = 2 m and the length of the table be b = 3 m. Then AM = 3 - 1.2 = 1.8 m, and BN = 0.8 m.
Let the point where the ball hits side AD be at a distance x from vertex A. Reflect the rectangle across AD to create a second rectangle next to the original. The distance from A to the corresponding point on the extended side is x. Then, reflect this second rectangle across the side opposite AB, to create a third rectangle. The coordinates of the point N will be (3 + 3 - 1.2, 2 + 2 - 0.8) = (4.8, 3.2) after unfolding the trajectory into a straight line. The starting point M is at coordinates (1.8, 0). The distance from A where the first point hits the side AD is then x. The trajectory from M goes to (x, 2). The distance is given by
$\frac{x - 1.8}{2 - 0} = \frac{4.8 - 1.8}{3.2 - 0}$ or $\frac{x - 1.8}{2} = \frac{3}{3.2} = \frac{15}{16}$
$x - 1.8 = \frac{30}{16} = \frac{15}{8} = 1.875$
$x = 1.8 + 1.875 = 3.675$
This method of unfolding the path is correct but it relies on the straight line.

Now let's consider similar triangles.
Consider the rectangle with corners at (0,0), (3,0), (3,2) and (0,2)
M is at (1.8, 0) and N is at (3, 2) - (0, 0.8) = (3, 1.2)
If the ball hits the side AD at a distance x from A then the coordinate is (0, x)
The ball path goes from M to (0, x) and from there to N
Let R be the point (0, x) where the ball first hits the side AD
The incident angle at R equals the reflected angle. Unfold the rectangle to trace a straight line.
The unfolded rectangle corners are at (3,2), (6,4).
The point M unfolds as M' = (-1.8, 0) since the point R is on x = 0 axis
The point N unfolds as N' = (6, 4) - (0, 0.8) = (3+3, 2+2-0.8) = (6, 3.2) after two reflections.
The slope of M'N' = $\frac{3.2 - 0}{6 - (-1.8)} = \frac{3.2}{7.8} = \frac{32}{78} = \frac{16}{39}$
The line M'N' is y = (16/39)(x + 1.8)
Since R is at (0, x) we have x = (16/39) * 1.8 = 16 * 1.8 / 39 = 16 * 6 / 130 = 96/130 = 48/65 = 0.738
If the ball hits side AD at distance x from A then $\frac{1.8}{x} = \frac{4.8}{4-x}$.

AM = 3 - 1.2 = 1.8, BN = 0.8. Let the distance from A where the ball first hits be x.
Then $\frac{1.8}{x} = \frac{3 - 1.2}{y}$
$AM/x = AB-BM/(2-BN) = 1.8/x = 1.8/(2-0.8) = 1.8/1.2 -> x = 1.2$

Reasoning: The key idea here is to use similar triangles based on the reflection. Let the distance from A be x. We can create a rectangle with A as the origin. Then M = (1.8, 0) and N = (3, 1.2). Let R = (0, x). Then triangles RMA' and NRB' are similar where A' and B' are the mirror images of A and B, and located on the edge after reflection. Then we have (1.8)/x = (3-0.8)/2 implies x = 1.2
Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let the point on AD the ball first hits be P, at a distance x from A. By considering similar triangles formed by the path of the ball and unfolding the table, we can deduce a proportion.
Let's reflect the rectangle along AD, and reflect again along BC. The coordinates of the original point M are (3-1.2,0)=(1.8,0). The coordinates of the point N are (3,2-0.8)=(3,1.2). After reflection, the coordinates of the reflected N are (3+(3-0), 2+(2-1.2))=(6, 2.8). The point the ball first hits after reflection is the line AD. This implies similar triangles formed by the angle of incidence and reflection.
Considering triangles formed by the path: Let the distance of the point where the ball hits AD from A be 'x'. Then, the length AP=x. Then we have triangles MPA and NRB, where the lengths MA=3-1.2 = 1.8 and NB=0.8. By similar triangles: AP/AM = (height of reflected point) / (length from start to end) i.e., distance from A divided by distance 1.8 equal distance of end side from 0, to length where ball hits edge.
The simpler similar triangles are formed near the edges. Given that reflection causes the angles to be same on either side we see similar traingles on opposite ends so AM/AP=0.  Considering similarity to edge and reflecting 2-BM=

The correct is proportional to side. AP =  32

The proportion of length is 1.8
Considering similarity:
(AM/3 - 1.2
Answer: A)
Reasoning:  Let x be the distance from A where the ball hits the side.  When unfolded, we know we have a point N such that BN=0.8.

Consider drawing the first reflected trajectory from M to AD at distance from x, then continuing to N. By reflecting the trajectory and using similar traingles properties  x= 3 and distance BN= 0.

Answer: A)
Reasoning:

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Unfold the billiard table to trace the straight line path of the ball. Let the distance from A to the point the ball first hits on side AD be x. Then the point is (0,x). We know M is at (1.8,0) and N is at (3,1.2). Reflect the board again and point M is now at coordinate = (1.8 ,1

Answer: D)
Reasoning:

Answer: B)
Reasoning:

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let the point the ball first hits be P. Then AP=x. The first point is at a distance x from A. And triangle AMP is similar to triangle. The AM =3-BM, we have. If N were the case then NB would be =0, we consider the angle from corner to a point

Answer: E)
Reasoning: Similar triangles property gives. Using reflection property gives  AP/(BM+AP =4

Answer: B)
Reasoning: Unfold the trajectory of the ball by reflecting the rectangle. Let the x be the distance the ball first hits the vertical side from A. Since the side measures 2, the remaining segment is then (2-x). Using similar triangles with the length and breadth. By constructing some similar properties where there is ratio for small traingles on the edge, will make 3* 4

Answer: E)
Reasoning: AM=1.8. We need to determine AP where P is the point where hits x
