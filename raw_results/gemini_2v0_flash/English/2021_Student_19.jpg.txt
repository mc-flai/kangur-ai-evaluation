Reasoning: As the toilet paper is unrolled (x increases), the thickness of the roll (y) decreases. Initially, the roll is quite thick, so the decrease in thickness is small for a given length of unrolled paper. As the roll gets thinner, the same length of unrolled paper will result in a larger decrease in thickness. This suggests that the thickness decreases at an increasing rate (i.e., the rate of change of y becomes more negative as x increases). This is best described by the curve in option (E). Option (D) looks similar, but it decreases too quickly in the beginning, then slows down too soon as x grows.

Answer: E)
