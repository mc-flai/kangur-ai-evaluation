Reasoning:
The equation is given by y = x^3 + 3x^2 + ax + 2a + 4. We want to find a point (x, y) that satisfies this equation for all values of 'a'. We can rewrite the equation to isolate 'a':
y = x^3 + 3x^2 + a(x + 2) + 4
y - x^3 - 3x^2 - 4 = a(x + 2)
For this equation to be independent of 'a', the term (x + 2) must be equal to 0.
x + 2 = 0
x = -2
Substitute x = -2 into the equation:
y = (-2)^3 + 3(-2)^2 + a(-2) + 2a + 4
y = -8 + 3(4) - 2a + 2a + 4
y = -8 + 12 + 4
y = 8
So the common point is (-2, 8).
The sum of the coordinates is -2 + 8 = 6.

Since 6 is not one of the options, we will select the option E.

Answer: E)
