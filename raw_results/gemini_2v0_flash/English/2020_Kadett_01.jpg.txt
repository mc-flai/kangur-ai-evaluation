Reasoning:
A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
First, evaluate each of the additions:
A) 2 + 11 = 13 (prime)
B) 4 + 7 = 11 (prime)
C) 6 + 11 = 17 (prime)
D) 3 + 4 = 7 (prime)
E) 5 + 7 = 12 (not prime because 12 can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12)
So, the answer is E.

Answer: E)
