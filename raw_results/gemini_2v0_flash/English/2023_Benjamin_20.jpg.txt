Reasoning: The second row fields contain the shapes in the two fields below.
The first field in the second row must contain the shapes of the first and second field of the first row (a circle). The second field in the second row must contain the shapes of the second (empty field) and third field of the first row (square and circle).
Therefore, to get the second field of the second row (which will include a square and circle), the empty field in the first row must have a triangle.

Answer: B)
