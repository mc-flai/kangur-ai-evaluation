Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given expressions:
Expression 1: 2<sup>2021</sup> + 2<sup>2022</sup> = 2<sup>2021</sup> + 2<sup>2021</sup> * 2 = 2<sup>2021</sup>(1+2) = 2<sup>2021</sup> * 3
Expression 2: 3<sup>2021</sup> + 3<sup>2022</sup> = 3<sup>2021</sup> + 3<sup>2021</sup> * 3 = 3<sup>2021</sup>(1+3) = 3<sup>2021</sup> * 4 = 3<sup>2021</sup> * 2<sup>2</sup>
The largest common divisor (GCD) of these two expressions will be the product of the common factors raised to the lowest power they appear in either expression.
Expression 1: 2<sup>2021</sup> * 3
Expression 2: 3<sup>2021</sup> * 2<sup>2</sup>
Common factors are 2 and 3.
The smallest power of 2 is 2<sup>2</sup> (from Expression 2) and 2<sup>2021</sup> (from Expression 1), so min(2, 2021) = 2.
The smallest power of 3 is 3<sup>1</sup> (from Expression 1) and 3<sup>2021</sup> (from Expression 2), so min(1, 2021) = 1.
Therefore, the GCD is 2<sup>2</sup> * 3<sup>1</sup> = 4 * 3 = 12.
