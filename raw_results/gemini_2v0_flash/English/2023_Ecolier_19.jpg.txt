Reasoning:
There are a total of 3! = 6 possible orders for the three boys to enter the room. The given conditions eliminate some of these possibilities.
Let's list all 6 possible orders and eliminate those that violate the conditions:
1. Hermann, Felix, Clemens (Hermann is first - eliminate)
2. Hermann, Clemens, Felix (Hermann is first - eliminate)
3. Felix, Hermann, Clemens (Okay)
4. Felix, Clemens, Hermann (Clemens is second - eliminate)
5. Clemens, Hermann, Felix (Okay)
6. Clemens, Felix, Hermann (Felix is second - eliminate)
So, only orders 3 and 5 are valid. Therefore, there are 2 possible orders.

Reasoning:
Let's write out the possible orderings and eliminate based on the given conditions. The conditions are:
Hermann is not first.
Felix is not second.
Clemens is not third.
The possible orders are:
HFC
HCF
FHC
FCH
CHF
CFH
Hermann is not first, so eliminate HFC and HCF.
Now we have:
FHC
FCH
CHF
CFH
Felix is not second, so eliminate FHC and CFH.
Now we have:
FCH
CHF
Clemens is not third, so eliminate FCH.
We are left with CHF, which does not violate any condition.
However, we can also try to find the solution systematically. There are 3! = 6 total permutations.
Hermann cannot be 1st. Felix cannot be 2nd. Clemens cannot be 3rd.
If Hermann is second, then we have:
_ H _
The possibilities are:
CFH, FCH
If Hermann is third, then we have:
_ _ H
The possibilities are:
FC H, CFH
Felix cannot be in 2nd. Clemens cannot be in 3rd.
So, we must eliminate FCH
The options are CFH and FCH. Since Felix cannot be 2nd and Clemens cannot be 3rd, only the orderings Felix, Clemens, Hermann (FCH) and Clemens, Hermann, Felix (CHF) are possible. However, Clemens cannot be third, so FCH is eliminated, and Hermann cannot be first so CHF is possible. Thus we have, FCH and CHF. Therefore the correct answer is 2.

Reasoning:
Total possible orderings are 3! = 6
Orders are HFC, HCF, FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH
H cannot be first -> remove HFC and HCF
FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH
F cannot be second -> remove FHC and CFH
FCH, CHF
C cannot be third -> remove FCH
CHF
Hermann cannot be the first.
Felix cannot be the second.
Clemens cannot be the third.
Let's enumerate the possibilities and eliminate as we go.
Possibilities are: HFC, HCF, FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH
Rule 1, Herman cannot be first, remove HFC, HCF. Remaining are FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH
Rule 2, Felix cannot be second, remove FHC, CFH. Remaining are FCH, CHF
Rule 3, Clemens cannot be third, remove FCH. Remaining is CHF. Also, if we have CHF, then Hermann is second, Felix is third and Clemens is first which satisfies all the criteria. Another possibility is FCH. Thus FCH also should also be a valid solution.
Let's check FCH: Felix is First, Clemens is second, Hermann is third
This would violate the original constraint that Felix is not the second.
With this configuration, we can't deduce a 2nd configuration.

Let me recheck again.
Possible solutions are permutations of the 3 boys:
HFC
HCF
FHC
FCH
CHF
CFH
Remove HFC, HCF
FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH
Remove FHC, CFH
FCH, CHF
FCH has Felix 1st, Clemens 2nd, Hermann 3rd. This satisfies that Hermann is not the 1st, Felix is not the second, Clemens is not the third
CHF has Clemens 1st, Hermann 2nd, Felix 3rd. This satisfies that Hermann is not the 1st, Felix is not the second, Clemens is not the third

Reasoning:

We can list all possible orderings (3! = 6) and eliminate the ones that violate the given conditions:
1. HFC (Hermann is first - Invalid)
2. HCF (Hermann is first - Invalid)
3. FHC (Felix is second - Invalid)
4. FCH (Felix is first, Clemens is second, Hermann is third - Valid)
5. CHF (Clemens is first, Hermann is second, Felix is third - Valid)
6. CFH (Felix is second - Invalid)
Thus, there are only 2 valid orderings: FCH and CHF.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There are 3! = 6 possible arrangements. We can list them and eliminate:
HFC: Hermann first - invalid
HCF: Hermann first - invalid
FHC: Felix second - invalid
FCH: Felix first, Clemens second, Hermann third - Valid.
CHF: Clemens first, Hermann second, Felix third - Valid.
CFH: Felix second - invalid

Therefore only 2 arrangements are valid.

Answer: B)
Final Answer:
Reasoning: Total number of possible orderings = 3! = 6.
List possible arrangements.
HFC, HCF, FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH.
Condition 1: Hermann is not first: Remove HFC, HCF. Result is FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH.
Condition 2: Felix is not second: Remove FHC, CFH. Result is FCH, CHF.
Condition 3: Clemens is not third: Remove FCH. Result is CHF.
However, FCH: Felix, Clemens, Hermann. Felix is not second, Hermann is not first, Clemens is not third. Therefore FCH and CHF are valid solutions

Reasoning:
Let's consider all possible arrangements of the three boys: HFC, HCF, FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH
1. Hermann cannot be first: remove HFC and HCF, leaving: FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH
2. Felix cannot be second: remove FHC and CFH, leaving: FCH, CHF
3. Clemens cannot be third: remove FCH, leaving CHF.

However, we made a mistake in the logic. Let us list arrangements.
There are a total of 6 possible orderings. Let's consider orderings 1, 2, and 3.
1. Hermann cannot be first.
2. Felix cannot be second.
3. Clemens cannot be third.
Possible Orderings:
HFC - Invalid
HCF - Invalid
FHC - Invalid
FCH - Valid - Felix First, Clemens Second, Hermann Third
CHF - Valid - Clemens First, Hermann Second, Felix Third.
CFH - Invalid

Thus, there are only 2 solutions:
FCH
CHF

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
We are given three boys, Hermann, Felix, and Clemens.
We are told that Hermann is not first, Felix is not second, and Clemens is not third.

Total possible orderings without any restrictions = 3! = 6.
Let's list out the possibilities and eliminate:
1. HFC (Hermann first - not allowed)
2. HCF (Hermann first - not allowed)
3. FHC (Felix second - not allowed)
4. FCH (Felix first, Clemens second, Hermann third - Valid)
5. CHF (Clemens first, Hermann second, Felix third - Valid)
6. CFH (Felix second - not allowed)

Therefore only FCH and CHF are allowed.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total possible permutations of 3 boys = 3! = 6.
HFC, HCF, FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH

1. Hermann cannot be first. So we eliminate HFC and HCF
Remaining: FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH

2. Felix cannot be second. So we eliminate FHC and CFH
Remaining: FCH, CHF

3. Clemens cannot be third. So we can eliminate FCH and remain only with CHF. But let's check the original conditions again.
If the order is FCH: Felix is 1st, Clemens is 2nd, Hermann is 3rd. Hermann is not first, Felix is not second, Clemens is not third. This is a possible solution.
If the order is CHF: Clemens is 1st, Hermann is 2nd, Felix is 3rd. Hermann is not first, Felix is not second, Clemens is not third. This is a possible solution.

The order FCH has Felix first, Clemens second, and Hermann third. None of them occupy the "forbidden positions" of the problem statement. So FCH is a valid solution.
The order CHF has Clemens first, Hermann second, and Felix third. Again, nobody is in the "forbidden positions" so it too is a possible solution.

Hence there are two possibilities.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let's list out all possible arrangements:
HFC
HCF
FHC
FCH
CHF
CFH
Hermann cannot be first: So remove HFC, HCF. Remaining arrangements are: FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH.
Felix cannot be second: Remove FHC and CFH. Remaining arrangements are: FCH, CHF.
Clemens cannot be third: FCH has Clemens in second, Hermann in third, Felix first.
CHF has Clemens first, Hermann second, Felix third. Clemens is not the third. So this is one solution.
Let's review FCH: Felix is first, Clemens is second, Hermann is third.
Hermann isn't first. Clemens isn't third. Felix isn't second. All conditions are met.
Therefore there are 2 solutions.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The problem states three conditions that limit the number of valid permutations: Hermann can't be first, Felix can't be second, Clemens can't be third.
We need to consider all 3! = 6 possible permutations and rule out the invalid ones.

1. HFC - Invalid (Hermann is first)
2. HCF - Invalid (Hermann is first)
3. FHC - Invalid (Felix is second)
4. FCH - Valid (Felix is first, Clemens is second, Hermann is third. None are in their forbidden spots.)
5. CHF - Valid (Clemens is first, Hermann is second, Felix is third. None are in their forbidden spots.)
6. CFH - Invalid (Felix is second)

Therefore only 2 permutations, FCH and CHF, are valid.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Three boys, three positions.
1.Hermann not first. Possible second or third
2.Felix not second. Possible first or third.
3.Clemens not third. Possible first or second

HFC is invalid because Hermann is first.
HCF is invalid because Hermann is first.
FHC is invalid because Felix is second.
FCH is valid, because Felix is first, Clemens is second and Hermann is third.
CHF is valid, because Clemens is first, Hermann is second and Felix is third.
CFH is invalid, because Felix is second.

So the only valid ones are FCH and CHF, two possibilities.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total possible orderings are 3! = 6, which are: HFC, HCF, FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH.
Given: Hermann is not first. Felix is not second. Clemens is not third.
1. Hermann is not first eliminates: HFC, HCF. Possible orderings are now: FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH
2. Felix is not second eliminates: FHC, CFH. Possible orderings are now: FCH, CHF
3. Clemens is not third eliminates: The two remaining orderings are FCH and CHF. Checking if they satisfy all conditions.
In FCH, Felix is first, Clemens is second, Hermann is third. It satisfies all the conditions.
In CHF, Clemens is first, Hermann is second, Felix is third. It satisfies all the conditions.
Thus, there are two valid orderings.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
We can list out the possible orderings and eliminate based on the conditions.
Total possible orderings:
HFC, HCF, FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH
Condition 1: Hermann is not first. Eliminate orderings starting with Hermann: HFC, HCF
Remaining possibilities: FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH
Condition 2: Felix is not second. Eliminate orderings with Felix in second position: FHC, CFH
Remaining possibilities: FCH, CHF
Condition 3: Clemens is not third. FCH is Felix first, Clemens second, Hermann third - satisfies the rule. CHF is Clemens first, Hermann second, Felix third - satisfies the rule. Both FCH and CHF are valid orderings.

Therefore, there are two valid orderings.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
We can systematically list the possibilities and eliminate those that violate the rules.
The total number of possible orderings is 3! = 6:
1. HFC
2. HCF
3. FHC
4. FCH
5. CHF
6. CFH

Hermann is not first: Eliminate 1 and 2, leaving:
3. FHC
4. FCH
5. CHF
6. CFH

Felix is not second: Eliminate 3 and 6, leaving:
4. FCH
5. CHF

Clemens is not third: This is a valid ordering for both scenarios where the boys are arranged as FCH, and as CHF.

Only 2 orderings are there.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:

Total permutations possible without restrictions: 3! = 6
Permutations possible: HFC, HCF, FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH

Hermann cannot be first, so we eliminate any permutation where Hermann is in the first spot. HFC, HCF

Felix cannot be in the second spot so eliminate FHC and CFH

This leaves us with two: FCH, CHF

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The question asks us to find how many possible orders are there for the boys to enter the room, given that Hermann isn't first, Felix isn't second and Clemens isn't third. 

1) Calculate total possible arrangements: Three boys can be arranged in 3! (3 factorial) ways which is 3*2*1 = 6.

2) Consider restrictions and manually derive answer: Let us write all possible arrangements
- Hermann, Felix, Clemens (Not possible - Hermann is first)
- Hermann, Clemens, Felix (Not possible - Hermann is first)
- Felix, Hermann, Clemens (Felix is first and neither is the second)
- Felix, Clemens, Hermann(Felix is first and Clemens is second and Herman is third - satisfies all conditions)
- Clemens, Hermann, Felix(Clemens is first and Hermann is second and Felix is third- satisfies all conditions)
- Clemens, Felix, Hermann (Clemens is first and Felix is second- not possible - Felix in second)
There are two acceptable ones "Felix, Clemens, Hermann" and "Clemens, Hermann, Felix"

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
We are given three boys: Hermann (H), Felix (F), and Clemens (C). The conditions are:
Hermann is not first
Felix is not second
Clemens is not third

Total possible permutations = 3! = 6.
List them out and eliminate possibilities:
1. HFC (Hermann is first. Invalid.)
2. HCF (Hermann is first. Invalid.)
3. FHC (Felix is second. Invalid.)
4. FCH (Felix is first, Clemens is second, Hermann is third. Valid.)
5. CHF (Clemens is first, Hermann is second, Felix is third. Valid.)
6. CFH (Felix is second. Invalid.)

Therefore, only two valid orderings are FCH and CHF.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
List all possible orderings (3! = 6) and eliminate those that violate conditions.

HFC - violates H not first
HCF - violates H not first
FHC - violates F not second
FCH - satisfies all conditions
CHF - satisfies all conditions
CFH - violates F not second

Therefore there are two valid orderings: FCH, CHF.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
We have the following constraints:
Hermann is not first.
Felix is not second.
Clemens is not third.

The possible arrangements of H, F, and C are 3! = 6:
HFC
HCF
FHC
FCH
CHF
CFH

Constraint 1 eliminates HFC and HCF.
We are left with: FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH

Constraint 2 eliminates FHC and CFH.
We are left with: FCH, CHF

These two orderings satisfy constraint 3.

Therefore, there are 2 possible orderings.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let's consider all 3! = 6 permutations and eliminate the invalid ones:
Hermann Felix Clemens (HFC) - invalid (Hermann is first)
Hermann Clemens Felix (HCF) - invalid (Hermann is first)
Felix Hermann Clemens (FHC) - invalid (Felix is second)
Felix Clemens Hermann (FCH) - valid
Clemens Hermann Felix (CHF) - valid
Clemens Felix Hermann (CFH) - invalid (Felix is second)

Thus, only two arrangements, FCH and CHF, are valid.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There are 3! = 6 ways to order three boys.
HFC, HCF, FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH
We are given that Hermann is not first, so eliminate HFC and HCF.
We are left with FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH.
Felix is not second, so eliminate FHC and CFH.
We are left with FCH, CHF.
Clemens is not third. Looking at the remaining options:
FCH (Felix is 1st, Clemens is 2nd, Hermann is 3rd) - this does not contradict Clemens is not 3rd. This permutation still can be included.
CHF (Clemens is 1st, Hermann is 2nd, Felix is 3rd) - this does not contradict Clemens is not 3rd.

So we are left with 2 orderings

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There are 3! = 6 possible orderings of the boys. We are given three constraints: Hermann cannot be first, Felix cannot be second, Clemens cannot be third.

Let's list out the orderings and see which satisfy the constraints.
1. HFC - No, Hermann is first.
2. HCF - No, Hermann is first.
3. FHC - No, Felix is second.
4. FCH - Yes, Felix is first, Clemens is second, Hermann is third.
5. CHF - Yes, Clemens is first, Hermann is second, Felix is third.
6. CFH - No, Felix is second.

Thus, there are only 2 orderings that satisfy all the conditions.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There are 3! = 6 possible orders for the boys.
Hermann cannot be first. Felix cannot be second. Clemens cannot be third.
Possible orders:
1. HFC - Hermann is first (invalid)
2. HCF - Hermann is first (invalid)
3. FHC - Felix is second (invalid)
4. FCH - Valid
5. CHF - Valid
6. CFH - Felix is second (invalid)
Therefore, there are 2 possible orders.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The boys are Hermann, Felix, Clemens.
Total number of ways to arrange them = 3! = 6
The question states:
Hermann cannot be first.
Felix cannot be second.
Clemens cannot be third.

Possible arrangements:
1. HFC - invalid (Hermann is first)
2. HCF - invalid (Hermann is first)
3. FHC - invalid (Felix is second)
4. FCH - Felix is first, Clemens is second, Hermann is third. Valid arrangement.
5. CHF - Clemens is first, Hermann is second, Felix is third. Valid arrangement.
6. CFH - invalid (Felix is second)

The only two valid arrangements are FCH and CHF. Hence the answer is 2.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There are three boys and three positions. First, we can calculate the total number of arrangements as 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.
Then, we can analyze the question constraints. The question is asking the possible arrangements so let's analyze this one by one:
1) HFC = not possible since Hermann is first.
2) HCF = not possible since Hermann is first.
3) FHC = not possible since Felix is second.
4) FCH = this is possible since all conditions are met.
5) CHF = this is possible since all conditions are met.
6) CFH = not possible since Felix is second.

Thus, there are two possible arrangements (FCH and CHF).

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let the three boys be Hermann (H), Felix (F) and Clemens (C). We are given 3 constraints: H cannot be 1st, F cannot be 2nd, C cannot be 3rd.
Total number of permutations of 3 objects is 3! = 6.
Let's list all permutations and eliminate.
1. HFC (Hermann is 1st - Eliminate)
2. HCF (Hermann is 1st - Eliminate)
3. FHC (Felix is 2nd - Eliminate)
4. FCH (Felix is 1st, Clemens is 2nd, Hermann is 3rd - Valid)
5. CHF (Clemens is 1st, Hermann is 2nd, Felix is 3rd - Valid)
6. CFH (Felix is 2nd - Eliminate)

Therefore, only 2 permutations are valid. FCH and CHF.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There are 3 boys: Hermann, Felix, and Clemens. Hermann can't be first, Felix can't be second, and Clemens can't be third.

List all possible arrangements:
HFC (Hermann is first, invalid)
HCF (Hermann is first, invalid)
FHC (Felix is second, invalid)
FCH (Valid)
CHF (Valid)
CFH (Felix is second, invalid)

Therefore, the only valid orderings are FCH and CHF. There are 2 such orderings.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let's list all 3! = 6 possibilities and eliminate using the given constraints:
- Hermann, Felix, Clemens (HFC): invalid because Hermann is first
- Hermann, Clemens, Felix (HCF): invalid because Hermann is first
- Felix, Hermann, Clemens (FHC): invalid because Felix is second
- Felix, Clemens, Hermann (FCH): valid because all constraints are met
- Clemens, Hermann, Felix (CHF): valid because all constraints are met
- Clemens, Felix, Hermann (CFH): invalid because Felix is second

So only two orderings are possible: FCH and CHF.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There are a total of 3! = 6 possible arrangements. Let's list them and eliminate the ones that are invalid based on the constraints.
The arrangements are: HFC, HCF, FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH.
Constraint 1: Hermann is not first. This eliminates HFC and HCF.
Constraint 2: Felix is not second. This eliminates FHC and CFH.
Constraint 3: Clemens is not third. We are left with FCH, CHF and they satisfy this condition.
FCH: Felix is 1st, Clemens is 2nd, Hermann is 3rd. - is valid.
CHF: Clemens is 1st, Hermann is 2nd, Felix is 3rd. - is valid.
So, there are 2 possible orderings: FCH and CHF

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
First, we find the total number of possible arrangements: 3! = 6. Then we eliminate:

1. HFC: Hermann is first. INVALID
2. HCF: Hermann is first. INVALID
3. FHC: Felix is second. INVALID
4. FCH: Valid since everyone is in the right place.
5. CHF: Valid since everyone is in the right place.
6. CFH: Felix is second. INVALID

So we have 2 combinations possible.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There are 3 boys: H (Hermann), F (Felix), C (Clemens). Hermann cannot be first, Felix cannot be second, and Clemens cannot be third.

Total possible orderings are 3! = 6:
1. HFC
2. HCF
3. FHC
4. FCH
5. CHF
6. CFH

Eliminate HFC, HCF because Hermann cannot be first:
FHC
FCH
CHF
CFH

Eliminate FHC, CFH because Felix cannot be second:
FCH
CHF

Therefore, the valid arrangements are FCH and CHF.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
We can write out all the permutations and eliminate the ones that don't satisfy the constraints.

Total possible permutations = 3! = 6. Let H = Hermann, F = Felix, C = Clemens
1. HFC - Hermann is first. Invalid
2. HCF - Hermann is first. Invalid
3. FHC - Felix is second. Invalid
4. FCH - Felix is first, Clemens is second, Hermann is third. **Valid**
5. CHF - Clemens is first, Hermann is second, Felix is third. **Valid**
6. CFH - Felix is second. Invalid

Two permutations are valid: FCH and CHF

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The number of possible ways is 3! = 6.
Hermann can't be first
Felix can't be second
Clemens can't be third.

The orderings are:
HFC - Invalid.
HCF - Invalid.
FHC - Invalid.
FCH - Valid.
CHF - Valid.
CFH - Invalid.

Therefore there are 2 possibilities.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The possible orderings are
HFC, HCF, FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH

Hermann is not the first - removes HFC, HCF
Felix is not the second - removes FHC, CFH

We are left with FCH, CHF.
Neither of these has Clemens as the last.

So the answer is 2.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The total possible permutations are 3! = 6. Let's list out the options and eliminate the impossible ones:
HFC (Hermann is first, so this is invalid)
HCF (Hermann is first, so this is invalid)
FHC (Felix is second, so this is invalid)
FCH (This is possible because no one is in the position they cannot be in)
CHF (This is possible because no one is in the position they cannot be in)
CFH (Felix is second, so this is invalid)

This leaves us with 2 possible arrangements

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There are three boys, Hermann, Felix, and Clemens, and the number of arrangements is 3! = 6. The conditions are:
1) Hermann is not first
2) Felix is not second
3) Clemens is not third
Let's list them and eliminate the non-valid arrangements.
1. HFC - invalid, because Hermann is first
2. HCF - invalid, because Hermann is first
3. FHC - invalid, because Felix is second
4. FCH - valid
5. CHF - valid
6. CFH - invalid, because Felix is second

So only two possibilities are valid, FCH and CHF.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
First list all permutations.
HFC - Hermann is first (invalid)
HCF - Hermann is first (invalid)
FHC - Felix is second (invalid)
FCH - Felix is first, Clemens is second, Hermann is third - all positions OK
CHF - Clemens is first, Hermann is second, Felix is third - all positions OK
CFH - Felix is second (invalid)

The question asked:
How many different orders are there for the boys to enter the room?
The only valid orders are FCH and CHF. There are two different orders

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There are 3! = 6 possible orderings of the three boys. We list them out and eliminate possibilities:
1) HFC - Hermann is first: invalid
2) HCF - Hermann is first: invalid
3) FHC - Felix is second: invalid
4) FCH - Valid! F is first, C is second, H is third.
5) CHF - Valid! C is first, H is second, F is third.
6) CFH - Felix is second: invalid

Only two orderings are valid.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total possible arrangements of the three boys: 3! = 6
1. HFC (Hermann is first. Not valid)
2. HCF (Hermann is first. Not valid)
3. FHC (Felix is second. Not valid)
4. FCH (Felix is first, Clemens is second, Hermann is third. Valid)
5. CHF (Clemens is first, Hermann is second, Felix is third. Valid)
6. CFH (Felix is second. Not valid)

The two valid arrangements are FCH and CHF.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
We have three people entering a room. The total possible orders are 3! = 6. We need to eliminate some of those based on the rules.
Let's write them out and eliminate.
HFC - no good because Hermann is first
HCF - no good because Hermann is first
FHC - no good because Felix is second
FCH - okay, all conditions are met.
CHF - okay, all conditions are met.
CFH - no good because Felix is second

Thus only 2 possible orders

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total possible orderings = 3! = 6.

Hermann, Felix, Clemens (HFC) - Invalid, Hermann is first.
Hermann, Clemens, Felix (HCF) - Invalid, Hermann is first.
Felix, Hermann, Clemens (FHC) - Invalid, Felix is second.
Felix, Clemens, Hermann (FCH) - Valid.
Clemens, Hermann, Felix (CHF) - Valid.
Clemens, Felix, Hermann (CFH) - Invalid, Felix is second.

Thus we have two valid possibilities: FCH and CHF.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
List all the orderings, total 3! = 6
HFC
HCF
FHC
FCH
CHF
CFH

1: H not first, remove HFC HCF
Remaining: FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH
2: F not second, remove FHC, CFH
Remaining: FCH CHF
3: C not third: Both combinations are good!
So there are 2 solutions.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The order is 3! = 6 total combinations
HFC , HCF , FHC , FCH , CHF , CFH
H can't be first: Eliminate HFC and HCF
Remains: FHC , FCH , CHF , CFH
F can't be second: Eliminate FHC and CFH
Remains: FCH and CHF
Two combinations

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total possible orderings are 3! = 6. The constraint is that Hermann is not first, Felix is not second and Clemens is not third. Lets list out possible combinations and remove wrong ones.

1. HFC (Hermann is first so this is incorrect)
2. HCF (Hermann is first so this is incorrect)
3. FHC (Felix is second so this is incorrect)
4. FCH (Felix is first, Clemens is second and Hermann is third which fits given constraint.)
5. CHF (Clemens is first, Hermann is second and Felix is third which fits given constraint.)
6. CFH (Felix is second so this is incorrect)

Only FCH and CHF are possible and they are 2.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Total arrangements are 3! = 6

HFC HCF FHC FCH CHF CFH

Eliminate ones starting with H
HFC HCF

Remaining FHC FCH CHF CFH
Eliminate the ones with F second
FHC CFH

Remaining FCH CHF

Each condition has been accounted, which are now left with Felix Clemens Hermann and Clemens Hermann Felix.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The problem requires finding the number of possible orderings given 3 boys with 3 constraints.
Let the boys be represented by letters: Hermann (H), Felix (F), Clemens (C).

First, calculate the total number of permutations: 3! = 6

Then, identify which permutations violate the constraints:
1. **HFC:** Hermann is first (violates constraint)
2. **HCF:** Hermann is first (violates constraint)
3. **FHC:** Felix is second (violates constraint)
4. **FCH:** Felix is first, Clemens is second, Hermann is third.  (Valid - no constraints violated)
5. **CHF:** Clemens is first, Hermann is second, Felix is third.  (Valid - no constraints violated)
6. **CFH:** Felix is second (violates constraint)

Therefore, there are 2 valid orderings: FCH and CHF.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
We have 3 boys. We know H is not the first. F is not the second. C is not the third.
Listing all possible outcomes. 3! is 6.
HFC
HCF
FHC
FCH
CHF
CFH

H not first - remove HFC and HCF.
Felix not second - remove FHC and CFH.
The remainders are:
FCH
CHF

Therefore, only two work.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Three boys, so 3! = 6 possible arrangements. The arrangements are HFC, HCF, FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH.
*Hermann is not the first*: Remove orderings HFC and HCF. We are left with FHC, FCH, CHF, CFH
*Felix is not the second*: Remove orderings FHC and CFH. We are left with FCH, CHF
*Clemens is not the third*: This condition does not eliminate any of our two remaining orderings.

FCH: Hermann is 3rd, Felix is 1st, Clemens is 2nd. Satisfies the conditions.
CHF: Hermann is 2nd, Felix is 3rd, Clemens is 1st. Satisfies the conditions.

Therefore there are 2 arrangements that work.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Three boys can be arranged in 3! = 6 different orders. These orders are:

HFC
HCF
FHC
FCH
CHF
CFH

We are given the following constraints:
*   Hermann is not first
*   Felix is not second
*   Clemens is not third

Now, let's examine the different orders with these constraints:

*   HFC: Hermann is first - Invalid
*   HCF: Hermann is first - Invalid
*   FHC: Felix is second - Invalid
*   FCH: This arrangement satisfies all constraints.
*   CHF: This arrangement satisfies all constraints.
*   CFH: Felix is second - Invalid

Therefore, there are only two valid arrangements: FCH and CHF.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let's analyze all possible cases:
Case 1: Hermann is first: HFC and HCF: 2 possibilities (but not valid)
Case 2: Felix is first: FHC and FCH: 2 possibilities
Case 3: Clemens is first: CHF and CFH: 2 possibilities
Valid combinations are: FCH and CHF because H is not 1st, F is not 2nd, C is not
