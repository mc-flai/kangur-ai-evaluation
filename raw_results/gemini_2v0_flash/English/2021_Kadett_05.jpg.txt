Reasoning:
The question states that the 5 pieces form a rectangle with a calculation written on it. The visible pieces read "2021". The options below are candidate answers. We need to find the missing pieces.
Looking at the options A, B, C, D, E, and by placing the number 2021 at the beginning we can see that the 5 pieces when correctly combined could form 202 + 199 = 401 or 208 + 2021 = 2229 or others. Thus a rectangle cannot be completed.
So the pieces have to form a calculation written on it i.e. 202 + 1 = 203 or 202 - 1 = 201 etc. The available numbers for calculations are 202, 1 and a missing value in place of the blank puzzle piece.

Considering the answer options, we test by seeing if we can complete the rectangle that results in any of the result.

A) -100. Consider this answer. We would arrange the numbers to create this result i.e. 208 - 100 = 108. However we cannot arrange the puzzle pieces that would result in this calculation. Similarly, testing other answers yields the same outcome.
So, let us check the numbers below to form our answer:
If the solution is -1, we can try to use the equation: 202 - 201 = -1? No because it is negative.
If the solution is 199, we can try to use the equation: 200 + 1 = 201 != 199 or 202 -3 = 199. Therefore this can be a valid answer as the blank is " + " and "99 " can come from 1 piece.
Therefore the calculation formed is 202 + 199. Also the numbers are a rectangle when fitted correctly.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
The pieces are part of an equation. By looking at the available numbers and the answer choices, the only plausible equation is 202 + 199 = 401. Therefore, the missing pieces combined must read " + 99".

Answer: D)
