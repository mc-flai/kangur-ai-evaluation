Reasoning: The question asks how many stamps Leonie uses for the date 15032018. Since each digit is stamped once, we just need to count the number of digits. The date has 8 digits: 1, 5, 0, 3, 2, 0, 1, 8. So she uses 8 stamps. Since 8 is not an option, it is implied we are to count the unique digits used. The digits used are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8. There are six unique digits used in the date 15032018.
