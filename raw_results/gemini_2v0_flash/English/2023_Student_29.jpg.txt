Reasoning: The volume of water in the upright glass is the base area times the height of the water. Let the height of the water in the upright glass be h. The base area is given as 3π cm^2. Thus, the volume of water in the upright glass is 3πh cm^3.

The volume of water in the slanted glass is the same as the volume of water in the upright glass. The water level is at the same height in both glasses. The fact that the slanted glass touches its bottom at exactly one point tells us that the height of the water is equal to the radius of the base. The area of the base is given as 3π. Since the area of a circle is πr^2, we have πr^2 = 3π. Therefore, r^2 = 3, and r = sqrt(3). Thus, the height of the water h = sqrt(3).

Now we can find the volume of water in the upright glass: 3πh = 3π * sqrt(3) = 3πsqrt(3). Therefore the answer is 3√3π cm³.
