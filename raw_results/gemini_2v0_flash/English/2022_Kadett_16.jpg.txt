Reasoning:
The square flowerbed has a side length of 12 m. The area of the entire flowerbed is 12 m * 12 m = 144 m².
The diagram shows that the flowerbed is divided into four sections. One section has side 4 m and 4m respectively. So the area of the square where the sunflower is planted is 4 m * 4 m = 16 m². The sunflower also occupies half of the rest of the flowerbed, which consists of two rectangles with dimensions 4 m by 8 m. The total area of these rectangles is 4 m * 8 m + 4 m * 8 m = 32 m² + 32 m²= 64 m². The sunflower occupies half of this area, which is 64 m² / 2 = 32 m². Therefore, the total area where the sunflower is planted is 16 m² + 32 m² = 48 m².
