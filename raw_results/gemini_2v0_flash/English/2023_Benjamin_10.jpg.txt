Reasoning:
Franziska writes down three consecutive two-digit numbers using symbols. The numbers are in increasing order: ☐◇, ♡△, ♡□.
Since the numbers are consecutive, they can be thought of as n, n+1, and n+2. We need to determine what the next number, n+3, looks like. The first two digits are represented by ☐, ♡. Since the third number starts with ♡, we know ♡ is bigger than ☐. Since the last number is ♡□, the next number should be ♡◇.
