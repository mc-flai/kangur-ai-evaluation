Reasoning:
Let $b$ be the number of brothers and $s$ be the number of sisters.
Every child has at least two brothers and one sister. This means that if a child is a boy, then there are at least two other boys and one girl. So there are at least three boys and one girl.
If a child is a girl, then there are at least two boys and at least one other girl. So there are at least two boys and two girls.
Combining these, we have at least three boys and one girl. Let there be 3 boys and 1 girl. Then each boy has 2 brothers and 1 sister, and the girl has 3 brothers and 0 sisters.
So we need at least 3 boys and 2 girls. Then each boy has 2 brothers and 2 sisters, and each girl has 3 brothers and 1 sister. Thus there are $3+2=5$ children in the family.

Reasoning:
Let $B$ be the number of boys and $G$ be the number of girls.
Each boy has at least two brothers and one sister. This means that $B \geq 3$ and $G \geq 1$.
Each girl has at least two brothers and one sister. This means that $B \geq 2$ and $G \geq 2$.
Therefore, $B \geq 3$ and $G \geq 2$. Thus the minimum number of children in the family is $3+2=5$.
