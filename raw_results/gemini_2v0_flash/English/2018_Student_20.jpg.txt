Reasoning:
The angle of a rectangle is 90 degrees. In the first rectangle, one of the angles is 40 degrees, so the other angle is 90 - 40 = 50 degrees. Similarly, for the second rectangle, if one of the angles is 30 degrees, the other is 90 - 30 = 60 degrees. The adjacent angles formed by the rectangles and the straight line sum up to 180 degrees. Therefore, the two other angles between the straight line and the sides of the rectangles are 180 - 50 = 130 degrees and 180 - 60 = 120 degrees. The angle around the point is 360 degrees. Therefore, the angle alpha equals 360 - 90 - (180 - 50) - (180 - 60) = 360 - 90 - 130 - 120 = 270 - 250 = 20 degrees.
However, the angles given are 40 and 30.
Consider the first rectangle. One angle with respect to the straight line is 40°. Hence the other adjacent angle is 180 - 40 = 140°. In a rectangle, the two adjacent sides are perpendicular to each other. So one angle is 90 degrees. The two angles near $\alpha$ sum to 180 - (90-40) = 130° and 180 - (90-30) = 120°.
Then, $\alpha = 360 - 90 - 120 - 40 - 30$, which doesn't make sense.

The two rectangles form angles 40° and 30° *with a straight line.* This means that one of the angles between a side of the rectangle and the straight line is 40°, and the other angle between the side of the other rectangle and the straight line is 30°. This information is already given in the form of a diagram. The problem then is asking for $\alpha$.
Consider the smaller angles in the two rectangles. They are 90 - 40 = 50 and 90 - 30 = 60.
The sum of the angles is 50 + 60 = 110. The angle formed between the two sides and the point between them is 360. Therefore, 360 - 90 -90= 180. 180-alpha. But now, 360 - 90- alpha = 110.
Looking at the diagram again, alpha + 30 + some small angle + 40 = 180. Then 90 - 30 and 90-40. 90-40 is 50. 90-30 = 60.
180 - 40 = 140. And 180 -30 = 150. 140 + 150.
The other angle, beta is = 90-(180-140)
The other angle gamma is = 90-(180-150)
I am lost.

However, it is likely that alpha is 40+30 + (a small angle in the rectangles that have 40 & 30) = something

Let x + 30 be the complement and x + 40 be the complement.
90 - 30 = 60. And 90-40 = 50
90+ alpha = 180 - 30 -40.

The value of alpha is 180- (50) - 110 = 20. But the angle $\alpha$ seems much larger.
The total straight line angle is 180. So, we have (90-40) = 50 and (90-30) =60. In total, we have 30+60 = 90. Alpha seems approximately 120.

Alpha and angles next to it make up for full angle 360. Therefore 360 - 90 = to the angles.
Looking at the diagram, the closest I can find is B) 120.

Reasoning: Looking at the diagram and the given angles, a logical process leads to the idea that angle $\alpha$ can be found using supplementary angles and the 90° angle of a rectangle. 120 is a good estimation.
Answer: B)
