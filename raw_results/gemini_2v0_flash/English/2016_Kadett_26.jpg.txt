Reasoning:
Let the numbers written on the board be $n_1, n_2, \dots, n_k$ where $n_i \neq n_j$ for $i \neq j$.
We are given that the product of the two smallest numbers is 16, and the product of the two largest numbers is 225.
Let the two smallest numbers be $a$ and $b$, where $a < b$. Then $ab = 16$. The possible pairs of $(a, b)$ are $(1, 16), (2, 8), (4, 4)$. Since no two numbers are the same, we can discard $(4, 4)$.
So the two smallest numbers are either 1 and 16, or 2 and 8. Since $2 < 8 < 16$ is possible and $1<2<8$ is also possible, we can't determine which pair it is just yet.

Let the two largest numbers be $x$ and $y$, where $x < y$. Then $xy = 225$. The possible pairs of $(x, y)$ are $(1, 225), (3, 75), (5, 45), (9, 25), (15, 15)$. Since no two numbers are the same, we can discard $(15, 15)$.
So the two largest numbers are either 1 and 225, 3 and 75, 5 and 45, or 9 and 25.

If the two smallest numbers are 1 and 16, then the list is $1, 16, \dots$. Since 16 is one of the smallest numbers, then $x$ and $y$ cannot be 1 and 225 since numbers must be unique. The possibilities are:
$1 < 16 < 3, 75$ - impossible
$1 < 16 < 5, 45$ - impossible
$1 < 16 < 9, 25$ - $1, 9, 16, 25$ are four numbers.
If there are only these four numbers, their sum is $1+9+16+25=51$.
Then the options are:
9 and 25.
The numbers could be 1, 9, 16, 25. Then the sum would be 1+9+16+25 = 51. This is not one of the options.

If the two smallest numbers are 2 and 8, then the list is $2, 8, \dots$.
Consider 9 and 25 to be the two largest numbers. Then the numbers on the board are 2, 8, 9, 25.
The sum is 2+8+9+25 = 44.

Now, let's write out the factors of 16 and 225 to determine the natural numbers on the board.
Factors of 16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
Factors of 225: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 25, 45, 75, 225

We have the product of two smallest numbers is 16. These two numbers must be different. Thus, possible pairs are (1, 16), (2, 8).
Also, the product of two largest numbers is 225. These two numbers must be different. Thus, possible pairs are (1, 225), (3, 75), (5, 45), (9, 25).

If the smallest are 2 and 8 and the largest are 9 and 25, then the numbers are 2, 8, 9, 25. The sum is 2+8+9+25 = 44.
This meets the condition of having natural numbers written on the board with no two being the same.

Reasoning:
We identify possible pairs of smallest and largest numbers based on the given products. We then combine these to find a possible set of numbers on the board and their sum, which matches one of the provided answer choices.
