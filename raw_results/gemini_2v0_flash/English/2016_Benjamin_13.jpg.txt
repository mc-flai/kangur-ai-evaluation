Reasoning:
Let 'g' be the number of girls and 'b' be the number of boys.
We are given that g + b = 30.
Every boy shares a desk with a girl. Also, half the girls share a desk with a boy.
So, the number of girls who share a desk with a boy is g/2.
Since every boy shares a desk with a girl, the number of boys 'b' must be equal to the number of girls who share a desk with a boy.
Therefore, b = g/2.
Now we have two equations:
1) g + b = 30
2) b = g/2

Substitute equation (2) into equation (1):
g + g/2 = 30
(2g + g)/2 = 30
3g/2 = 30
3g = 60
g = 20
Now, substitute g = 20 into equation (2):
b = 20/2
b = 10
So, there are 10 boys in the class.
