Reasoning:
We are given that a + 2 = b - 2 = c × 2 = d ÷ 2. Let's say this common value is equal to k. Then:
a + 2 = k => a = k - 2
b - 2 = k => b = k + 2
c × 2 = k => c = k / 2
d ÷ 2 = k => d = 2k
Since k is a positive number, comparing a, b, c, and d in terms of k, we have k-2, k+2, k/2, and 2k respectively. 2k will always be greater than k+2, k-2 and k/2 if k>2. If k=1, c =1/2, which is not a positive whole number. If k=2, c=1, a=0 which is not a positive whole number. So, k must be greater than 2. Since d = 2k, d is the largest.
