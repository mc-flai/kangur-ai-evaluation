Reasoning:
First, we need to determine the total number of teachers at Anna's school. We know that 45 teachers represent 60% of the total.
Let 'x' be the total number of teachers. So, 0.60x = 45.
Dividing both sides by 0.60, we get x = 45 / 0.60 = 75.

Now we know there are 75 total teachers. We are told 12% of the teachers come by car.
To find the number of teachers who come by car, we need to find 12% of 75, which is 0.12 * 75.
Calculating this, 0.12 * 75 = 9.
