Reasoning: Let the side of the smaller square be $s$. Then the vertices of the shaded quadrilateral are at the midpoints of the sides of the smaller squares. The shaded area is 3. This quadrilateral is a square, and its side length is $s/\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, its area is $(s/\sqrt{2})^2 = s^2/2 = 3$, so $s^2 = 6$.
The area of each small square is 6. Since there are two smaller squares, the combined area is $2(6) = 12$. The two rectangles have combined area equal to $2 \times \text{length} \times \text{width}$. From the image, the length of the rectangle is equal to the side of the smaller square $s = \sqrt{6}$, and the width is the side of the large square minus the side of the smaller square, divided by 2. The side of the large square is $s + s = 2s = 2\sqrt{6}$. So the width of the rectangle is $(2\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{6}) = \sqrt{6}$. So each rectangle has area $\sqrt{6} \times \sqrt{6} = 6$. The two rectangles have combined area $2(6) = 12$.
The total area of the square is $(2\sqrt{6})^2 = 4 \times 6 = 24$. The area of the non-shaded area is the total area minus the area of the shaded quadrilateral, so $24 - 3 = 21$.
Alternatively, the area of the two smaller squares is $s^2 + s^2 = 6 + 6 = 12$. The two rectangles have the same area. Consider one rectangle. The area of the large square is $(2s)^2 = 4s^2 = 4(6) = 24$. The two rectangles comprise the area of the large square minus the two smaller squares. So $24 - 12 = 12$. Since there are two rectangles, each rectangle has area $12/2 = 6$. Therefore the total non-shaded area is $6 + 6 + 12 = 12 + 6 = 18 +3=21-3 = 18$. The area of the non shaded is the area of each rectangle (6) + Area(square)/6=Total area - the shaded area (3)
24 - 3 = 21. Then this is non shaded.

Reasoning: The area of shaded portion is 3.  Let the side of the small square be $s$. The area of the small square is $s^2$. The vertices of the shaded quadrilateral are midpoints of sides of the smaller squares.  The shaded quadrilateral is a square with side $s/\sqrt{2}$.  The area of the shaded square is $(s/\sqrt{2})^2 = s^2/2$. Thus, $s^2/2 = 3$, so $s^2 = 6$.  The side length of the larger square is $2s$, and the area is $(2s)^2 = 4s^2 = 4(6) = 24$.  Area of non-shaded portion is the large square minus area of shaded, $24-3 = 21$.
