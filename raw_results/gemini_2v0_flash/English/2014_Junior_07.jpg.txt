Reasoning:
The statement "Everybody has solved more than 20 problems" is false. This means that at least one person has not solved more than 20 problems. This is equivalent to saying that at least one person has solved 20 or fewer problems.
Option A: "Nobody has solved more than 20 problems" is not necessarily true, as it is possible that some people have solved more than 20 problems.
Option B: "Somebody has solved less than 21 problems" is correct. Since at least one person has solved 20 or fewer problems, that person has solved less than 21 problems.
Option C: "Everybody has solved less than 21 problems" is not necessarily true. It is possible that some people have solved more than 20 problems.
Option D: "Somebody has solved exactly 20 problems" is not necessarily true, as it is possible that everyone has solved fewer than 20 problems.
Option E: "Somebody has solved more than 20 problems" is not necessarily true.

Answer: B)
