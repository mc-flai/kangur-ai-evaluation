Reasoning:
The question asks in which round team D plays against team F. We need to look through each round of matches to find a round with D and F playing each other. Looking at round 4, we see the match E-F is scheduled. However, the question asks when team D plays against F. After carefully re-reading the question, we see there may be a mistake. The problem statement refers to a "diagram" showing which match will be broadcast but a diagram showing "which match will be broadcast" is not actually provided. However, there is a small table that shows the matches that will be broadcast and we are asked when team D plays against team F. Looking through the table, we see the match E-F on Round 4 and there are no DF pairs on Rounds 1,2,3,5. Since it mentions that 3 matches happen simultaneously, it could be referring to something other than the match broadcasted. But looking only at the table, we find nothing to indicate any match between D and F. Therefore the answer must be D.

Answer: D)
