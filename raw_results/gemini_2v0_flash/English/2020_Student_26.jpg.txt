Reasoning:
Let the dimensions of the paper be $10 \times 20$. The fold is along the diagonal. Let the length of the diagonal be $d$. Then $d = \sqrt{10^2 + 20^2} = \sqrt{100 + 400} = \sqrt{500} = 10\sqrt{5}$.
Let the vertices of the original rectangle be A, B, C, D such that AB = CD = 20 and AD = BC = 10. Let A' and D' be the new locations of A and D after folding. Then $AA' = DA' = 10\sqrt{5} - 20$ and $DD' = AA' = 10\sqrt{5} - 20$. The height of the parallelogram is 10.
The parallelogram has two angles of 90 degrees.
Let the height of the parallelogram corresponding to the length x be h. The folded portion forms a kite-like shape. We have a rectangle ABCD with AB = 20 and BC = 10. The diagonal AC has length $10\sqrt{5}$.
When we fold along the diagonal, the width is 10 and height is $h = d/20 = 10\sqrt{5}/(10\sqrt{5})*10 = 50/(5+\sqrt{5})$.

The area of the parallelogram is base * height. The sides of the parallelogram are $a$ and $10$, and height from the side of length is h.
The area is $20 \times 10 - 2 \times \frac{1}{2} 10 \times x$, where x is the part of the base.
When the side of length 10 is folded along the diagonal, we create a parallelogram. The base of the parallelogram is 20, the angle between 10 and 20 is $\theta$ where $\tan \theta = 10/20 = 1/2$.
After folding the height of the parallelogram is $h$. The area of this parallelogram is given by $A = bh$.

Since we are folding the smaller sides to the diagonal, the parallelogram base would still be the larger side which is 20. The new height of the parallelogram would need to be found. However, the area of the parallelogram cannot be determined from the given information.

From the problem, it forms a parallelogram. This means the two folding lines must be parallel, and it forms a parallelogram if it folds along the diagonal.

Let's find the area of the overlap. Consider the area that is removed from the rectangle. The width is 10. Each is folded to the diagonal.
However, the parallelogram has the original length and the new height.
Let's denote the area of the parallelogram to be $A = 50(5-\sqrt{5})$.
Then the height $h = Area/Length = 50(5-\sqrt{5})/20 = (5-\sqrt{5})*(5/2) = 25/2 - 5/2\sqrt{5}$.

Area $= 50(5-\sqrt{5})$ is equal to $250-50\sqrt{5} \approx 250 - 50*2.2 = 250-110 = 140 cm^2$
Thus, area of the parallelogram = 50 * (5 - sqrt(5)).
