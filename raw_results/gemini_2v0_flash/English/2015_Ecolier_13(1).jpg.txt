Reasoning:
Let's denote the toy car as C, the teddy bear as T, the ball as B, and the ship as S.
We have the conditions:
1. The ship (S) must be next to the car (C).
2. The teddy bear (T) must be next to the car (C).

We can treat the car (C) as a central element. So, the possible arrangements adjacent to C can be CT, TC, CS, SC, or any combination of these.
Let's list the possible arrangements of the four toys such that the car is next to both the teddy bear and the ship:
\begin{itemize}
    \item T C S B
    \item T C B S
    \item B T C S
    \item S C T B
    \item S C B T
    \item B S C T
\end{itemize}

So, there are 6 possible orders.
