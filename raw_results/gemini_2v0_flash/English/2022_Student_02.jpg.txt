Reasoning:
We need to find the number of three-digit numbers divisible by 13.
The smallest three-digit number is 100.
The largest three-digit number is 999.
The smallest three-digit number divisible by 13 is 104 (13 * 8 = 104).
The largest three-digit number divisible by 13 is 988 (13 * 76 = 988).
Therefore, we need to find the number of integers from 8 to 76, inclusive.
This is 76 - 8 + 1 = 69.
