Let's denote the amount of money Ana, Bia, and Cris have initially as A, B, and C respectively. We know that A + B + C = 100.  We also know A = 2B and A = 2C, which means B = C = A/2.  Let the entrance fee be x.  After paying the entrance fee, Ana has A - x, Bia has B - x, and Cris has C - x. The problem states that after paying, Ana has three times what Bia and Cris have together. So A - x = 3((B - x) + (C - x)). Substituting B = C = A/2, we get A - x = 3(A/2 - x + A/2 - x) or A - x = 3(A - 2x) which simplifies to A - x = 3A - 6x, thus 5x = 2A. We can also write A + B + C = A + A/2 + A/2 = 2A = 100. So A = 50. Substituting this into 5x = 2A, we get 5x = 2(50) = 100, so x = 20.

Reasoning: Set up the equations based on the problem statement and solve for the entrance fee.
