Reasoning: The figure has 12 cubes. We need to count the number of connections between cubes. The bottom layer has 5 cubes. The central cube has 4 connections to other cubes in the horizontal plane. The first vertical stack has 2 connections, and the second vertical stack also has 2 connections. In total, 4 + 2 + 2 + 3 connections between horizontal cubes. From each of the vertical lines we have 2 drops, the central plane contains 3 drops, and the other drops would number 4 drops. If we add it up 3 drops in first plane, another 4 in the second plane and 2 vertical cubes is two connections and other is 2 it equals to 3+4+2+2 = 11 drops.

Answer: D)
