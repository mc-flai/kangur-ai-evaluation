Reasoning:
The big cube is composed of 4x4x4 = 64 small cubes. Initially, only one cube is grey.
On day one, the grey cube colors its neighbors. A cube in the center of the big cube has 6 neighbors. A cube on the face has 5 neighbors. A cube on the edge has 4 neighbors. A cube on the corner has 3 neighbors. Since we don't know where the grey cube is, we will solve this problem generically.
Let's assume the initial grey cube is in the very center. The number of neighbors depends on its location. Let's also assume that one cube is grey in the center. A cube can have at most 6 neighbors and at least 3 neighbors. Let's assume the starting cube is a central cube, which means it has 6 neighbors. So after day one, we will have 1+6 = 7 grey cubes.
On day two, the 7 grey cubes will color all their neighboring cubes grey. So each of those 6 neighbors will color their neighbors.
The initial grey cube has 6 neighbors.
Then there are 6 neighbors surrounding it.
Let's assume the initial cube is located at (2,2,2) where the coordinates go from 1 to 4.
The initial cube is at (2,2,2). It's neighbors are (1,2,2), (3,2,2), (2,1,2), (2,3,2), (2,2,1), (2,2,3). These are 6 neighbors. So after day 1, we have 7 grey cubes.
After day 2, each of the 7 cubes colors its neighbors.
(2,2,2) has 6 neighbors already colored.
(1,2,2) has 5 neighbors. 2,2,2 is already colored so we have 4 more.
(3,2,2) has 5 neighbors. 2,2,2 is already colored so we have 4 more.
(2,1,2) has 5 neighbors. 2,2,2 is already colored so we have 4 more.
(2,3,2) has 5 neighbors. 2,2,2 is already colored so we have 4 more.
(2,2,1) has 5 neighbors. 2,2,2 is already colored so we have 4 more.
(2,2,3) has 5 neighbors. 2,2,2 is already colored so we have 4 more.
So the total number of new cubes colored is at most 6x4=24 and the minimum is 3. It seems tedious.
So if a cube is in the center, it has 6 neighbors. If the grey cube is on a corner, it has 3 neighbors.
If the grey cube is at the corner (1,1,1), it has 3 neighbors, (2,1,1),(1,2,1),(1,1,2)
Day 1: 1+3 = 4
Day 2: Each colors neighbors
(1,1,1): has 3 neighbors colored.
(2,1,1): has 5 neighbors, and (1,1,1) is colored. 4 new neighbors.
(1,2,1): has 5 neighbors, and (1,1,1) is colored. 4 new neighbors.
(1,1,2): has 5 neighbors, and (1,1,1) is colored. 4 new neighbors.
So, we start with 1. then add 3. that gives 4.
then add 4+4+4 = 12. So we get a total of 1+3+4+4+4 = 1+3+12 = 16.
Day 1 has 7, and each has up to 5 uncolored, 7*5 = 35 total uncolored?
So each will add up to 4 more neighbors. 7*4=28. 7+28 is way too big.

1 (initial)+ 6 (first day) =7
We can also have 1+5 or 1+4 or 1+3.
If we have 6 additional, that gives 7 cubes. Then the outer neighbors have at most 5 additional neighbors.
1 + (3x2) = the grey one + 1 layer.
A corner would have 3 neighbors. A face edge would have 4 neighbors.
The maxiumum number will be when the origin cube (the original cube) is in the middle of the structure and this cube has 6 faces that can have adjacent neighbors. So origin at (2,2,2)
First Layer is 6 cubes. Second Layer is 8 surrounding points + 4+4+4 points on the faces + 1 = 64 -6 - 1
So if it is in middle then there is 1+ (6 at the start) ( at second day) has max neighbors and will influence more neighbors, 16
