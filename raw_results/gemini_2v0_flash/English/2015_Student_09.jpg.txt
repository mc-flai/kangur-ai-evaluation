Reasoning:
Let the diameters of the semicircles with areas X, Y, and Z be a, b, and c respectively. Since the diameters form the sides of a right-angled triangle, according to the Pythagorean theorem, we have a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
The area of a semicircle is given by (1/2) * pi * r^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, r = d/2.
So the area of a semicircle with diameter d is (1/2) * pi * (d/2)^2 = (pi/8) * d^2.
Thus, we have X = (pi/8) * a^2, Y = (pi/8) * b^2, and Z = (pi/8) * c^2.
Substituting a^2 = (8/pi) * X, b^2 = (8/pi) * Y, and c^2 = (8/pi) * Z into the Pythagorean theorem equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2, we get
(8/pi) * X + (8/pi) * Y = (8/pi) * Z.
Dividing by (8/pi), we have X + Y = Z.
Therefore, option C is the correct answer.
