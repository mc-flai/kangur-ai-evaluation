Reasoning:
First, we count the number of each shape used in the tower: 3 circles, 4 squares, and 4 triangles.
Then, we look for the options that consist of shapes which are not present in those counts.
A) 1 triangle, 1 square, 1 circle. These are all present in the tower.
B) 2 triangles, 1 square. These are all present in the tower.
C) 2 triangles, 1 circle. These are all present in the tower.
D) 1 circle, 1 square, 1 triangle. These are all present in the tower.
E) 1 triangle, 1 circle. These are all present in the tower.
However, we need to find the shapes that were NOT used. Therefore, we must look to eliminate the options with the fewest shapes used.
Examining the cards on the left we can see that:
There are 5 circles
There are 5 squares
There are 4 triangles.
The tower uses 3 circles, 4 squares and 4 triangles. Therefore, the unused cards must be made up of 2 circles and 1 square.
Therefore, the correct answer is D).
The unused cards are 1 square and 2 circles. Looking at the answer options, option D is close to 1 square and 1 circle, whereas option E has 1 triangle and 1 circle which are used.
Therefore D) must be incorrect because there are 5 squares.

Therefore, none of these cards seem to contain the shapes not used.

Reasoning:
Circles: 5 cards on the left, 3 used in the tower, so 2 circles not used.
Squares: 5 cards on the left, 4 used in the tower, so 1 square not used.
Triangles: 4 cards on the left, 4 used in the tower, so 0 triangles not used.
The unused cards are 2 circles, 1 square. None of the options show this exact combination.
Looking closer, we need to find out what card combinations were unused, given all cards on the left.

Reasoning:
Circles on hand: 5
Circles in tower: 3
Unused circles: 2
Squares on hand: 5
Squares in tower: 4
Unused squares: 1
Triangles on hand: 4
Triangles in tower: 4
Unused triangles: 0
So we need a combination of 2 circles and 1 square among our unused cards. There's no option that shows that. Therefore, the answers provided cannot represent the exact cards that were not used. But looking at what options can be immediately ruled out, (A), (B), (C) all use triangles and squares, whereas we need 2 unused circles and 1 unused square. The next answer to cross out is (D). Therefore, we are left with E, as the answer that contains cards not used

Answer: E)
