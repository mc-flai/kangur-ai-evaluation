Reasoning:
There are 5 people at the party: Anna, Bella, Claire, Dora, and Erika.
Anna shakes hands once. Since each person shakes hands with each other person only once, Anna must have shaken hands with Dora. Anna has shaken hands with Erika.
Dora shakes hands 4 times. Since there are 5 people total and Dora can only shake hands with 4 people at most, Dora must have shaken hands with everyone: Anna, Bella, Claire, and Erika.
Bella shakes hands twice. Since Dora shook hands with Bella, Bella only has one other handshake. Anna has shaken hands with Erika. Bella must have shaken hands with Erika.
Claire shakes hands 3 times. Claire shook hands with Dora. Claire shakes hands with Erika. Claire must have shaken hands with Dora.
Since Dora shook hands with everyone. Anna shook hands with Erika. Bella shook hands with Erika. And Claire shook hands with Erika. Erika must have shaken hands with Dora, Anna, Bella, and Claire. She shakes hands with 4 people in total.
