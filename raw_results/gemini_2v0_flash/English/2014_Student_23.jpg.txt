Reasoning: Let $b$ be the number of black kangaroos. Then the number of white kangaroos is $9-b$. We are given that if we pick three kangaroos at random, the probability that none of them is white is exactly two thirds. The number of ways to pick three kangaroos out of 9 is $\binom{9}{3} = \frac{9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 7 = 84$.
The number of ways to pick three black kangaroos is $\binom{b}{3}$. So the probability of picking three black kangaroos is $\frac{\binom{b}{3}}{\binom{9}{3}} = \frac{\binom{b}{3}}{84}$. We are given that this probability is $\frac{2}{3}$. Thus, we have the equation
$\frac{\binom{b}{3}}{84} = \frac{2}{3}$.
$\binom{b}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot 84 = 2 \cdot 28 = 56$.
We need to find $b$ such that $\binom{b}{3} = \frac{b(b-1)(b-2)}{6} = 56$.
$b(b-1)(b-2) = 56 \cdot 6 = 336$.
Since we have the choices 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, we can test each value of $b$.
If $b=1$, then $1(0)(-1) = 0$.
If $b=3$, then $3(2)(1) = 6$.
If $b=5$, then $5(4)(3) = 60$.
If $b=6$, then $6(5)(4) = 120$.
If $b=8$, then $8(7)(6) = 336$.
So $b=8$ is the solution. Therefore, the number of black kangaroos is 8.
