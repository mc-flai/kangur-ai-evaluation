Reasoning: We need to find which squares can be removed from the net so that the remaining 6 squares still form a valid cube net and are connected. A cube net typically consists of a row of four squares with one square connected to the top and another one to the bottom (or vice versa). Alternatively, it can also be a "T" shape.

If we remove square 4, the remaining net is 1-2-3-5-6-7. We can fold this net to form a cube (1-2-3-6 will be one long strip and 5 and 7 attach to the opposite sides). So removing 4 works.
If we remove square 7, the remaining net is 1-2-3-4-5-6. We can fold this net to form a cube (4-5-6-2 will be one long strip and 1 and 3 attach to the opposite sides). So removing 7 works.
If we remove square 3, the remaining net is 1-2-4-5-6-7. In this case, we have too many squares in the middle, and only 2 top squares, not enough to wrap to the other side of the cube. This does not work. Therefore only removing squares 4 or 7 makes the net form a cube.
