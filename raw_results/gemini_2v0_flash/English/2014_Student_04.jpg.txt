Reasoning:
Let's use variables:
* Smallest basket = S
* Middle basket = M
* Biggest basket = B

We know:
1. S + M + B = 48
2. S + B = 2M
3. S = M/2

Substituting (3) into (2):
M/2 + B = 2M
B = 2M - M/2
B = (4M - M)/2
B = (3M)/2

Substituting (2) into (1):
(S + B) + M = 48
2M + M = 48
3M = 48
M = 16

Now that we know M = 16, we can find S and B.
S = M/2 = 16/2 = 8
B = (3M)/2 = (3 * 16)/2 = 48/2 = 24

Therefore, the biggest basket has 24 balls.
