Reasoning:
Adam knows the color, Bruna knows the shape.
Adam: "I don't know and I know Bruna doesn't know either".
This means that the color Adam knows appears in multiple shapes, so it's either green or pink. If the color were pink, there'd be only one figure. The color is not pink, but the only option is either green or pink. This implies it's a green or pink figure. If the color was green, the possible shapes are hexagon, star, and square.
Bruna: "At first I didn't know, but now I know".
This means that the shape Bruna knows appears in multiple colors, and after Adam's statement, there is only one color that fits with that shape. The square only exists with the colors green or white, and this means that the shape is not a square. The hexagon exists only in green and white, so the shape cannot be a hexagon. Finally, the star exists with the colors white and green and Adam's statement makes this color unique, which the hexagon and square options can't.
Adam: "Now I know too".
This means that the shape Bruna knows is the star. Since Bruna knows the shape is a star, and she now knows that the shape is unique after Adam's statement that he doesn't know. Knowing this, Adam now also knows.
