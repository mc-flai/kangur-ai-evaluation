Reasoning:
Let $A_b$ be the area of the big hexagon and $A_s$ be the area of the small hexagon.
Let $A_d$ be the area of the dark sections.
We are given that $\frac{A_d}{A_s} = \frac{4}{3}$.
Also, $A_b = A_d + A_s$.
We want to find $\frac{A_s}{A_b}$.
From the given information, $A_d = \frac{4}{3}A_s$.
Substituting this into the equation for $A_b$, we have $A_b = \frac{4}{3}A_s + A_s = \frac{7}{3}A_s$.
Thus, $\frac{A_s}{A_b} = \frac{A_s}{\frac{7}{3}A_s} = \frac{3}{7}$.
None of the options match.

Let the side length of the small hexagon be $s$ and the side length of the large hexagon be $S$. The area of a regular hexagon with side length $a$ is given by $A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2$.
So $A_s = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}s^2$ and $A_b = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}S^2$. Then $\frac{A_s}{A_b} = \frac{s^2}{S^2}$.
The area of the shaded region is $A_d = A_b - A_s = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}(S^2 - s^2)$.
Also $\frac{A_d}{A_s} = \frac{4}{3}$ means $A_d = \frac{4}{3}A_s$, or $A_b - A_s = \frac{4}{3}A_s$.
Then $A_b = A_s + \frac{4}{3}A_s = \frac{7}{3}A_s$.
So $\frac{A_s}{A_b} = \frac{A_s}{\frac{7}{3}A_s} = \frac{3}{7}$.

However, if we consider the answer choices again, it is possible that the problem statement contains a typo and that it is asking for $\frac{A_d}{A_b}$.
Then $\frac{A_d}{A_b} = \frac{A_b - A_s}{A_b} = 1 - \frac{A_s}{A_b} = 1 - \frac{3}{7} = \frac{4}{7}$.

Let us assume instead that the question intended to state that $\frac{\text{Area of the dark sections}}{\text{Area of the big hexagon}} = \frac{4}{3}$.
In this case, $\frac{A_d}{A_b} = \frac{4}{3}$.
Since $A_d + A_s = A_b$, this implies that $A_d = \frac{4}{3}A_b$, which means $A_b > A_d$, which is impossible since $A_b = A_d + A_s$. The ratio cannot be greater than one.
There is likely an error in the problem.

Another possibility is that $\frac{\text{Area of the dark sections}}{\text{Area of the big hexagon}} = \frac{4}{7}$ for some reason.
$A_d = \frac{4}{7}A_b$ and $A_d + A_s = A_b$, so $A_s = A_b - A_d = A_b - \frac{4}{7}A_b = \frac{3}{7}A_b$.
Thus, $\frac{A_s}{A_b} = \frac{3}{7}$.

If we try to manipulate $\frac{4}{3}$ to match an answer, maybe we can find a relation. If instead, we want to find $\frac{A_d}{A_b}$ we have $A_d = \frac{4}{3}A_s$.
So $\frac{A_d}{A_b} = \frac{\frac{4}{3}A_s}{A_b}$. We want $A_b$ in terms of $A_s$, so $\frac{A_d}{A_b} = \frac{\frac{4}{3}A_s}{\frac{7}{3}A_s} = \frac{4}{7}$.

Reasoning: Given $\frac{A_d}{A_s} = \frac{4}{3}$. We know that $A_b = A_s + A_d$. So we can substitute $A_d = \frac{4}{3} A_s$ to get $A_b = A_s + \frac{4}{3} A_s = \frac{7}{3} A_s$.
Thus $\frac{A_s}{A_b} = \frac{A_s}{\frac{7}{3} A_s} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.42$.

(E) $\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$
(C) $\frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67$
(B) $\frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33$
(A) $\frac{3}{11} \approx 0.27$
(D) $\frac{3}{4} \approx 0.75$

Reasoning: Considering the options and the ratios possible, we will consider choice A which yields $\frac{3}{11}$
$\frac{A_s}{A_b} = \frac{3}{11}$ so $A_s = \frac{3}{11} A_b$ and $A_d = A_b - A_s = \frac{8}{11} A_b$. Then
$\frac{A_d}{A_s} = \frac{\frac{8}{11}A_b}{\frac{3}{11} A_b} = \frac{8}{3}$. Thus $\frac{A_d}{A_s} = \frac{4}{3}$ so $A_d = \frac{4}{3}A_s$. Then $A_b = A_s + \frac{4}{3}A_s = \frac{7}{3}A_s$. Then $\frac{A_s}{A_b} = \frac{3}{7}$. If we take the ratio of the ratios: $\frac{\frac{4}{3}}{\frac{8}{3}} = \frac{1}{2}$.

Considering $\frac{A_s}{A_b} = \frac{3}{11}$ this leads to $\frac{A_d}{A_s} = \frac{8}{3}$ so

Considering choice E, $A_s/A_b=3/5$. Then $A_s = (3/5)A_b$. Then $A_d=A_b - (3/5)A_b= (2/5)A_b$. Therefore $A_d/A_s = ((2/5)A_b)/((3/5)A_b)=2/3$ which doesn't work.

Reasoning: The closest answer is (B) $1/3$ which equals .33 whereas 3/7 equals roughly .43. Since there is no other option, let me double check my work. It makes sense that none of the answers actually can align with this. If we are given that the Area of the Dark Sections divided by the Area of the small hexagon = 4/3. That means that the dark sections are significantly more compared to the area of the small hexagon.

Final Answer: None of the answer choices provided are correct; the correct answer should be $\frac{3}{7}$. Given the choices, however, the closest answer is B
Answer: B)
