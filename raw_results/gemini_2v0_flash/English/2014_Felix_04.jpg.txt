Reasoning: The original square is made of 25 small squares. Counting the squares in the image, there are 3+3+3+2+1+2+1 = 16 small squares. Therefore the number of missing squares is 25-16 = 9. However, 9 is not an option. Going back, I count the number of squares that are visible in the given image. Row 1 has 3 squares, Row 2 has 3 squares, Row 3 has 3 squares, Row 4 has 2 squares and Row 5 has 1. Then there are two additional single squares on their own so 2. In total we have 3+3+3+2+1+1+1=14. So we subtract 14 from 25 and the result is 11. Again, 11 is not an option. Looking again, there are clearly 9 total squares as follows: 9 squares making a block + 4 squares + 1 = 14 + 2 additional single squares. So we have 14 + 2 = 16 small squares. Therefore, 25-16 = 9. I am still missing something. Let us draw the entire square as an array.
```
[][][][][]
[][][][][]
[][][][][]
[][][][][]
[][][][][]
```
We can see that the given figure is composed of the following:
```
[][][]
[][][]
[][][]
[][]
[]
```
and
[]
[]
So counting the number of available blocks gives: 3x3+2+1+1+1 = 9+4+1 = 14 available blocks. So 25-14 = 11 missing blocks. Again, this is not an option. I must be miscounting something. I need to recount carefully: 3+3+3 =9 in upper right box
then one isolated and one with 1 below = 3
and there is 1 isolated. SO we have 9+4+1 = 14 blocks filled. So 25 - 14 = 11 blocks missing. Again, this is not available.
Going back to basics. What can we see? What is given?
25 blocks should make a large square 5x5.
We need to count what is missing from the square:
1. Top right corner: We have [][][] so 2 missing.
2. Bottom Right: We have [][][] so 2 missing.
3. Top left corner: We have two rows of 2, so we have [][] [][], so 6-4 = 2 missing.
4. Bottom left corner: We have two []. One row of 3 must be 3 missing. One row of 3 must be 3 missing. Total = 6 blocks missing.
So 2(at top) + 2 (at bottom) = 4 missing + 6 (at left) = 10 blocks total.
