Reasoning: We need to find the year after 2016 whose digits sum to 9. We can test each option:
A) 2007: 2+0+0+7 = 9
B) 2025: 2+0+2+5 = 9
C) 2034: 2+0+3+4 = 9
D) 2108: 2+1+0+8 = 11
E) 2134: 2+1+3+4 = 10
Since the question asks for the *next* year after 2016, we need to consider the years in chronological order. 2007 is not after 2016, so it's not the answer. 2025, 2034, are after 2016 and their digits sum to 9. Since 2025 is less than 2034, and we want the *next* year after 2016, we choose 2025.

Answer: B)
