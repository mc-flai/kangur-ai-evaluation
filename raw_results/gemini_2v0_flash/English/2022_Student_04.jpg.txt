Reasoning:
We need to check which of the numbers is NOT divisible by the sum of its digits.
(A) 2022: 2 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 6. 2022 / 6 = 337. Divisible.
(B) 2023: 2 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 7. 2023 / 7 = 289. Divisible.
(C) 2024: 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 8. 2024 / 8 = 253. Divisible.
(D) 2025: 2 + 0 + 2 + 5 = 9. 2025 / 9 = 225. Divisible.
(E) 2027: 2 + 0 + 2 + 7 = 11. 2027 / 11 = 184.27... Not divisible.

Answer: E)
