Reasoning:
Let's assume Jennifer initially uses 1 unit of water.
She reduces the water pressure, reducing water usage by 1/4. This leaves her with 1 - (1/4) = 3/4 of the initial water usage.
She then reduces the shower time by 1/4. This means she now takes 3/4 of her original shower time.
Therefore, her new water usage is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.
The reduction in water usage is 1 - (9/16) = 16/16 - 9/16 = 7/16.

Answer: E)
