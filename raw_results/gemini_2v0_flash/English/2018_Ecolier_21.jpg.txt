Reasoning:
The problem states that there are 5 holes, and each hole is separated by 2 cm. If the belt is closed in the first hole instead of the last (fifth) hole, it will be longer by the distance between the first and last holes. There are 4 gaps of 2 cm each between the 5 holes, so the total extra length will be 4 * 2 = 8 cm.

Answer: B)
