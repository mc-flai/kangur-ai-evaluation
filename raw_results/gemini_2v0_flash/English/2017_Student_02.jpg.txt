Reasoning:
The H0-scale is 1:87, meaning 1 cm on the model represents 87 cm in reality. The model of Benjamin's brother is 2 cm tall. Thus, we need to multiply 2 cm by 87 to find the actual height in cm.
2 * 87 = 174 cm. Now, we need to convert cm to meters. Since 1 meter = 100 cm, 174 cm = 1.74 m.
