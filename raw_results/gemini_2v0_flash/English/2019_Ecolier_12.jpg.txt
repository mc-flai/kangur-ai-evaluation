Reasoning:
Let 'd' be the weight of one dog. From the first scale, we know that d < 12 kg. From the second scale, we know that 2d > 20 kg, which simplifies to d > 10 kg. Therefore, the weight of one dog, 'd', must be between 10 kg and 12 kg. Looking at the given options, only 11 kg satisfies this condition.
