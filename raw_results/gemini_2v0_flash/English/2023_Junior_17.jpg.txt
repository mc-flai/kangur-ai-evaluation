Reasoning:
There are 2023 steps in the staircase. Every third step is black. The number of black steps is 2023 // 3 = 674 with a remainder of 1. So there are 674 black steps and one more since 2023 divided by 3 has a remainder of 1, thus there are 674 + 1 = 675 black steps.
Anita walks up the staircase and steps on each step exactly once, alternating between right and left foot. To minimize the number of black steps the right foot lands on, the first step must not be black.
Let's consider that Anita steps on the first step with her left foot, so her right foot will be placed on steps 2, 4, 6, and so on. The black steps are 3, 6, 9, etc.
If she steps on the first step with her left foot, her right foot lands on even numbered steps. The black steps that are also even are: 6, 12, 18... which are multiples of 6. The number of multiples of 6 that are at most 2023 is 2023 // 6 = 337.
If she starts with her right foot, she will step on odd numbered steps with her right foot. The black steps are 3, 6, 9, etc. The number of black steps is 675. The number of black steps that are also odd numbered steps is: 3, 9, 15...These steps have the form 6k+3, where k is a non-negative integer. To count the number of such steps that exist, we need to find the largest k such that 6k+3 <= 2023. 6k <= 2020, so k <= 2020/6 = 336.666. So k <= 336. This means there are 337 such steps (since k starts at 0).
Comparing these two approaches, the minimum number of black steps she sets her right foot on is 337.
