Reasoning:
First, we need to determine the maximum number of cubes John used. The structure is 5x4x2. The total number of possible cubes is 5x4x2 = 40.

The front view is 5x2.
The right view is 4x2.
The top view is 5x4.

Now, we need to determine the minimum number of cubes that are needed to satisfy the three views.

From the front view, we know the maximum height is 2, and the width is 5. The number of columns in the front view are 5.
From the right view, we know the maximum height is 2, and the depth is 4. The number of columns in the right view are 4.
From the top view, we know the base is 5x4.

Looking at the top view, we can see there are 2 empty spaces, so 20-2 = 18 cubes at most from top view. However, the highest the shape is can be deduced by front and side views, so it could be less than that.

Let's analyze the columns.
Column 1 (leftmost column from the front view) has 2 blocks.
Column 2 has 2 blocks.
Column 3 has 1 block.
Column 4 has 2 blocks.
Column 5 has 2 blocks.
This requires at least 2+2+1+2+2=9 cubes in the front plane (i.e. x=0).
Row 1 (leftmost row in the right view) has 2 blocks.
Row 2 has 2 blocks.
Row 3 has 1 block.
Row 4 has 2 blocks.
This requires at least 2+2+1+2=7 cubes.
Now, looking at the top view, there is an empty spot in (2,2) and (3,3), which means we can take out those cubes.

Let's create the 3D representation of the object.
```
2 2 1 2 2
2 2 1 2 2
```

The total number of cubes is 18. If we remove the 2 blocks, we have 16.

Based on the front and side views, we need to find the number of cubes.
The base is 5x4 = 20.
The number of missing cubes is 2.
Each visible block must have a cube at least to satisfy the three views. In total, we need at least 18 blocks.
If we make each one of height 2, that becomes 36.
Front: 9 blocks up to height 2.
Right: 7 blocks up to height 2.
So to solve this, we need to determine the total number of blocks (40).
Then the maximum height = 2.
Maximum number of cubes removed = 40-18=22.

Reasoning:
Based on the different views and understanding how the shapes fit, the total number of cubes should be around 18. We started with 40 cubes in total (5x4x2) but, to satisfy all three views at the same time, the minimum number of blocks in total is 18. Ana, John's sister, is taking away the blocks that would satisfy this minimum. Then at most, 40-18=22 cubes would have to be taken away.
Answer: (D)
Answer: (D)
Reasoning:
First determine the total possible number of cubes in a 5x4x2 structure = 40 cubes. Now determine the minimum number of blocks required to represent all 3 views. Front View: Heights are 2,2,1,2,2 totaling 9 cubes. Side view heights 2,2,1,2 totaling 7 cubes. Now look at Top View with the two empty spaces. 20-2 =18 cubes. This means that some are stacked to achieve the front and side views. Max cubes (40) - min cubes (18)=22

Answer: (D)
Reasoning:
1. Maximum Possible Cubes: 5 x 4 x 2 = 40
2. Minimum Necessary Cubes: Analyze the top view first, which shows the layout. It's a 5x4 grid with two empty spaces. This immediately implies there are 20 - 2 = 18 cubes *at most*.
3. Combine with Front & Right Views: We need to ensure the 18 cubes from the top view *also* satisfy the front and right views.
*   The front view requires columns of heights 2, 2, 1, 2, 2. Sum = 9
*   The right side view requires rows of heights 2, 2, 1, 2. Sum = 7
This shows that there are at least 18 blocks from the front and side views,

If the construction has 18 cubes, Ana can remove at most 40-18 = 22 cubes without changing the three views.
Answer: (D)
Reasoning:
1. **Maximum Cubes:** The maximum number of cubes in a 5x4x2 rectangular prism is 5 * 4 * 2 = 40.

2. **Minimum Cubes:** To determine the minimum number of cubes needed, analyze the views:

*   **Top View:** The top view is a 5x4 grid with two missing cubes. That means there are at least 5*4 -2= 18 cubes.

*   **Front View:** Heights are 2, 2, 1, 2, 2. Sum = 9

*   **Right View:** Heights are 2, 2, 1, 2. Sum = 7. The max number of cubes that she can remove is 40 -18=22

Answer: (D)
Reasoning:
The construction sits within a 5x4x2 grid, so there is a maximum of 40 cubes.

We need to deduce the minimum number of cubes needed to satisfy the three views.

Top view shows 5x4 but two spaces are missing, so 18 cubes.
From the front view, we need at least a 'height' of 2 in two columns and 1 in one column, adding to nine minimum.
From the right view, we need at least a 'height' of 2 in two columns and a height of 1 in one column, so a minimum of 7.

Max possible minus min needed gives the answer.
40-18=22
