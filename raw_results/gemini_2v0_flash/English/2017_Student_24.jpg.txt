Reasoning:
When we cut off the four corners of the tetrahedron, each of the four smaller tetrahedra that are removed has side length half of the original tetrahedron. Since the ratio of volumes of similar figures is the cube of the ratio of corresponding side lengths, the volume of each smaller tetrahedron is (1/2)^3 = 1/8 of the volume of the original tetrahedron. Since the original tetrahedron has volume 1, each of the four tetrahedra cut off has volume 1/8. Therefore, the total volume of the four tetrahedra cut off is 4 * (1/8) = 1/2. The volume of the remaining solid is then 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.
