Reasoning:
First, we calculate the total number of sweets: 9 + 17 = 26 sweets.
Then, we divide the total number of sweets by 2 to find out how many sweets each person should have: 26 / 2 = 13 sweets.
Next, we subtract Julia's initial number of sweets from the desired number of sweets: 13 - 9 = 4 sweets.
Therefore, Katharina has to give 4 sweets to Julia.
