Reasoning: Let 's' be the side length of the square. Let's consider the right triangle formed by points D, B, and an extension of side DC.
The horizontal distance from D to B is s, and the vertical distance is also s.
Now, if we project the path DEFB onto the x and y axes, we can express the side length 's' in terms of DE, EF and FB.
Let's assume point D is at (0,0).
The coordinates of E are (x_E, y_E) = (5 cos(alpha), 5 sin(alpha)).
The coordinates of F are (x_F, y_F) = (5 cos(alpha) - 1 sin(alpha), 5 sin(alpha) + 1 cos(alpha)) where alpha is the angle between DE and the x-axis.
The coordinates of B are (x_B, y_B) = (5 cos(alpha) - 1 sin(alpha) - 2 cos(alpha), 5 sin(alpha) + 1 cos(alpha) - 2 sin(alpha)).
So the coordinates of B are (x_B, y_B) = (3 cos(alpha) - sin(alpha), 3 sin(alpha) + cos(alpha)). Since B has coordinates (s, s), we have
s = 3 cos(alpha) - sin(alpha) and s = 3 sin(alpha) + cos(alpha).
Adding these equations, 2s = 4 cos(alpha) + 2 sin(alpha) => s = 2cos(alpha) + sin(alpha)
Subtracting the equations, 0 = 2cos(alpha) - 4sin(alpha) => 2 cos(alpha) = 4 sin(alpha) => cos(alpha) = 2 sin(alpha).
Substituting into s = 3 sin(alpha) + cos(alpha), we get s = 3 sin(alpha) + 2 sin(alpha) = 5 sin(alpha)
Substituting into s = 3 cos(alpha) - sin(alpha), we get s = 3(2 sin(alpha)) - sin(alpha) = 5 sin(alpha)
sin(alpha) = s/5. Since cos(alpha) = 2 sin(alpha), cos(alpha) = 2s/5
sin^2(alpha) + cos^2(alpha) = 1
(s/5)^2 + (2s/5)^2 = 1
s^2/25 + 4s^2/25 = 1
5s^2/25 = 1
s^2 = 5
s = sqrt(5)
The x-distance from D to C is the sum of the x-components of DE, EF and FB. Similarly, the y-distance from D to C can be computed. Then we can use these sums to determine s.
s = 5cos(theta) - 1sin(theta) - 2cos(theta) = 3cos(theta) - sin(theta) where theta is the angle made between DE and DC. Also s = 5sin(theta) + 1cos(theta) - 2sin(theta) = 3sin(theta) + cos(theta).
Equating: 3cos(theta) - sin(theta) = 3sin(theta) + cos(theta) => 2cos(theta) = 4sin(theta) so cos(theta) = 2sin(theta).
Then s = 3sin(theta) + 2sin(theta) = 5sin(theta) and s = 3cos(theta) - sin(theta) = 6sin(theta) - sin(theta) = 5sin(theta).
Since cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) = 1, 4sin^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) = 1 => 5sin^2(theta) = 1 => sin(theta) = 1/sqrt(5).
s = 5sin(theta) = 5/sqrt(5) = sqrt(5)
The coordinate of B is (s,s). Consider projecting the segments DE, EF, FB onto the horizontal and vertical.
Horizontal: s = 5 cos(alpha) - 1 sin(alpha) + 2 cos(alpha)
Vertical: s = 5 sin(alpha) + 1 cos(alpha) + 2 sin(alpha)
So, s = 3 cos(alpha) - sin(alpha), and s = 3 sin(alpha) + cos(alpha)
Add these to get 2s = 4 cos(alpha) + 2 sin(alpha), so s = 2 cos(alpha) + sin(alpha)
Subtract these to get 0 = 2 cos(alpha) - 4 sin(alpha) => 2 cos(alpha) = 4 sin(alpha) => cos(alpha) = 2 sin(alpha)
Substitute into the first equation: s = 3(2 sin(alpha)) - sin(alpha) = 5 sin(alpha)
Substitute into the second equation: s = 3 sin(alpha) + 2 sin(alpha) = 5 sin(alpha)
Since cos^2(alpha) + sin^2(alpha) = 1, we have 4sin^2(alpha) + sin^2(alpha) = 1, so 5 sin^2(alpha) = 1, and sin(alpha) = 1/sqrt(5)
Therefore, s = 5/sqrt(5) = sqrt(5)

Reasoning: None of the offered solutions worked. The correct calculation yields $\sqrt{5}$, and it is no any of the possible options.
