Reasoning: The weight of the bowls are ordered according to the number of shapes at the bottom of the bowl. Q has 3 shapes, R has 3 shapes, S has 3 shapes, and T has 3 shapes. Z has 3 shapes at the bottom of the bowl. Looking at the shapes inside the bowl Z, we see a triangle, a circle, and a square. The triangle shape resembles the shape in bowl Q, the circle resembles the shape in bowl R, and the square resembles the shape in bowl S. Since the order of the shapes corresponds to the order Q, R, S, then bowl Z must be placed between bowls R and S.
