Reasoning: Squirrel A is closest to the nut to its left. After picking up the first nut, it is now closest to the nut immediately to its right, and will pick that one up next.
Squirrel B is closest to the nut to its right. It would then have to travel much farther to reach the nut to the left of A, which A will likely get there first. Squirrel C is closest to the nut to its right. Squirrel D is closest to the nut to its left. Squirrel E is closest to the nut to its left. Therefore, squirrel A will get a second nut.

Answer: A)
