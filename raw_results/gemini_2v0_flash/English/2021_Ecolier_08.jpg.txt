Let $w$ be the weight of a white ball, $g$ be the weight of a gray ball, and $b$ be the weight of a black ball. We can write the following equations based on the given information:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $g + b = 6$
    \item $3w + g = 14$
    \item $b + 2g = 10$
\end{enumerate}

From equation (1), we can write $b = 6 - g$. Substituting this into equation (3), we get:
$6 - g + 2g = 10$
$g = 4$

Now, substitute $g=4$ back into equation (1) to find $b$:
$4 + b = 6$
$b = 2$

Finally, substitute $g=4$ into equation (2) to find $w$:
$3w + 4 = 14$
$3w = 10$
$w = \frac{10}{3}$

However, the possible answers are integers. There must be a typo in the image. Assume the weight of the gray ball is twice as much as the black ball so that the third scale has two gray balls instead of one black and one gray. This changes the equation to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $g + b = 6$
    \item $3w + g = 14$
    \item $b + 2g = 10$
\end{enumerate}

From the third equation $b=10-2g$, we have to test the gray ball weight from the possible answer choices. From the first scale, $g<6$ and $b<6$ so this is a possibility. Let's rewrite equations (1) and (3):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $g + b = 6$
    \item $b + 2g = 10$
\end{enumerate}
Substituting $b$ from (1) into (3) we get: $(6-g)+2g = 10$ which implies $g = 4$ and therefore $b=2$. Substitute $g=4$ into the second equation to get:
$3w+4 = 14$
$3w = 10$
$w = 10/3$

Reconsider the equations and assume there is something off:
$g+b = 6$ (1)
$3w+g=14$ (2)
$b+2g = 10$ (3)
From (1), $b=6-g$
Substituting into (3) we get, $(6-g)+2g=10$ so $g=4$
From (1), $4+b = 6$ so $b=2$
From (2), $3w+4 = 14$ so $3w=10$ so $w=10/3=3.33...$
If we assume $w=3$, then from the second equation, $g=5$. Plugging that into the third equation:
$b=10-2g=10-10=0$. Therefore the first equation says $g+b=5=6$, which is false. Let us check $w=4$. From the second equation, we would have: $3w+g = 12+g=14$ so $g=2$. Plugging that into the third equation:
$b=10-2g = 10-4 = 6$. Therefore the first equation says $g+b = 2+6 = 8=6$ which is false. Let us check $w=5$, then from the second equation we would have: $3w+g = 15+g=14$ so $g=-1$. But this is false, so we are back to the idea that the answers are wrong.

Reasoning: We set up a system of equations based on the given information. We solved for the weight of the gray and black balls in terms of each other, and then substituted those values into the equation involving the white balls. However, solving this equation yields a non-integer value for the white balls' weight, which is not among the answer choices.
