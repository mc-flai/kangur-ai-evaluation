Reasoning:
The large cube is made of 125 small cubes, so it is a 5x5x5 cube.
There are 9 tunnels. Each tunnel goes through 5 cubes.
The tunnels are parallel to the sides of the cube. Since it is a cube and there are 9 tunnels, there are 3 tunnels in each direction (x, y, z).
Each tunnel removes 5 cubes. So, 9 tunnels remove 9*5 = 45 cubes.
However, some cubes are part of multiple tunnels. The intersection of each pair of tunnels has a single cube in common.
Since the tunnels are in 3 directions, there are 3 pairs of tunnels that intersect.
(T1, T2), (T1, T3), (T2, T3). In this case there are three different sets. Each group has 3 tunnels.

When the 9 tunnels intersect, they intersect at the very middle cube. The center cube lies on 3 tunnels. So there are other intersection areas that intersect.
The total number of cubes used in the tunnels is 3 rows x 5 length + 3 rows x 5 length + 3 rows x 5 length.
So there are 3 x 3 x 5 = 45 cubes. There are 3 intersections of different sets in each row. So, the total of the 45 - 3 intersections = 42.

The tunnels go all the way through the cube, so the big cube is a 5x5x5 cube, and the number of small cubes is 125.
The number of cubes used is 125 - 'cubes he is not using'. We must find how many cubes are actually being used for the actual cube.

There are 3 sets of holes.
A 5x5x5 cube uses 125 cubes.
The horizontal hole will go straight 5. Another set of 5. And another. So 3 sets of cubes (5x3). Each set of holes is 5 cubes long. So, 5x3 length horizontally. The next group is vertical, 5x3 length. And the third is depth-wise at 5x3. Since the sets of holes are overlapping, you can say the cube is made of 5 blocks wide and 5 blocks long at any given angle.

If the tunnel is along the z-axis, and is along y axis, and along x axis.
So there are 9 tunnels.
5 * 9 = 45 cubes are used in the tunnels. But, there are intersections.

If the horizontal holes are running through the cube through the center axis, then there's three planes. The intersection is that middle 1 axis for all the holes. The number of cube used is 125 - cubes not using.
Then the actual amount of cube used is 125 - X. So X is cubes not being used.
If there's 9 holes made. 1 hole takes 5 cubes. The center cube is the intersection, then how many not using?

Solid cubes forming the bigger cube is 125-x.
Cubes used making the tunnel is y. So, there's a way to represent y, 125-x = y.
Tunnel going all the way through, so the amount going through each hole is 5. So the amount for 9 tunnels is 45, but there's some intersect. In the middle the horizontal and vertical intersect. 3 tunnels going through. So intersect each other. How many is intersect? 45 - number intersect, so 125 - 45 + intersect.

Cubes left used is (5x5x5) - (5x3) - (5x3) - (5x3) + intersection.
125 - 45 + 6 = 86. Cube left is 86
Used is 86.  Cubes not using, 125-86 is not using. Number not using is 39.
