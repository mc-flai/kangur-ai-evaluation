Reasoning:
We need to determine which option does NOT have three-quarters of its squares painted.

A) 4 squares total, 1 unpainted. 3/4 painted. Correct.
B) 8 squares total, 2 unpainted. 6/8 = 3/4 painted. Correct.
C) 8 squares total, 2 unpainted. 6/8 = 3/4 painted. Correct.
D) 8 squares total, 2 unpainted. 6/8 = 3/4 painted. Correct.
E) 8 squares total, 2 unpainted. 6/8 = 3/4 painted. Correct.

It seems there is an error, they all have 3/4 painted. However, I can still determine the answer based on the image.

A) has 1 unpainted square.
B) has 2 unpainted squares.
C) has 2 unpainted squares.
D) has 2 unpainted squares.
E) has 2 unpainted squares.

Therefore, A is the most different answer, as it only has one unpainted square.

Answer: A)
