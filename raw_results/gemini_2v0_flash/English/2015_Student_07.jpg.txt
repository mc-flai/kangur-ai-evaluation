Reasoning: A convex quadrilateral has internal angles that are all less than 180 degrees. A right angle is 90 degrees.
If there are zero right angles, then all four angles can be less than 180 and still add up to 360.
If there is one right angle, then the other three angles can be less than 180 and still add up to 270.
If there are two right angles, then the other two angles can be less than 180 and still add up to 180.
If there are three right angles, then the remaining angle must be 90 degrees for the quadrilateral to have a total angle of 360 degrees.
If there are four right angles, then the quadrilateral is a rectangle or a square.
Therefore, the possible number of right angles is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, a quadrilateral with 4 right angles will have all internal angles less than 180, so 4 is possible. A quadrilateral with 3 right angles will have its 4th angle be 90 degrees.
The possible values of n are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. However, we must check that the quadrilateral is convex.
If there are 0 right angles, we can construct a trapezoid with angles 60, 80, 110, 110, which are all less than 180.
If there is 1 right angle, we can construct a quadrilateral with angles 90, 80, 100, 90, which are all less than 180.
If there are 2 right angles, we can construct a quadrilateral with angles 90, 90, 80, 100, which are all less than 180.
If there are 3 right angles, we can construct a quadrilateral with angles 90, 90, 90, 90, which are all less than 180.
However, a convex quadrilateral can only have a maximum of 3 right angles. If it had 4 right angles, the quadrilateral would be a rectangle/square. Since all angles are less than 180, it is convex. Therefore, 0, 1, 2, and 3 are valid.
A quadrilateral can have at most 3 right angles. If it had 4 right angles, it would have to be a rectangle, and hence convex.
But if it has 3 right angles, the fourth angle must be 90 degrees as well, so it is still a rectangle, and therefore convex.
Let the angles be a, b, c, d. We know a+b+c+d = 360. We want to find the maximum number of 90 degree angles allowed.
Without loss of generality, let a, b, c be right angles. Then a=b=c=90, so 90+90+90+d = 360, so d = 90.
Therefore, there can be at most 3 right angles. Options (A) and (B) are thus incorrect, as is option (E). Option (C) is incorrect because 4 is incorrect.

If n=3, then the fourth angle must be 90. This means the quadrilateral is a rectangle. So 3 is possible. Thus option (D) fails.
The final answer should be 0, 1, 2, 3. It has to be (C). I have to rethink my reasoning.
n can be 0, 1, 2, 3. Suppose there are three right angles. Then the fourth angle must be 90, so the quadrilateral is a rectangle.

Reasoning: A convex quadrilateral can have at most 3 right angles. If there are 4 right angles, it is a rectangle, and since each angle is less than 180, a rectangle is convex.
Therefore 0, 1, 2, 3 are all valid options.
If n=4, it is a rectangle which is convex.
(C) is the answer.

Answer: C)
