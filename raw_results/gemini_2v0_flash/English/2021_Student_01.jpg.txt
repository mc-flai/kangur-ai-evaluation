Reasoning: The temperature values for Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, and Thu are -1, -4, 0, 0, 3, -3, and -5, respectively. We need to look for the graph that corresponds to this sequence of temperatures.
A) Temperatures are increasing, then decreasing, which doesn't match the data.
B) Temperatures decreasing, then increasing, then decreasing again. This appears plausible.
C) Temperatures increasing, then constant, then decreasing. This is plausible as well.
D) Temperatures decreasing, then increasing, then decreasing again. This is plausible as well.
E) Temperatures decreasing, then increasing, then decreasing again. This is plausible as well.

Let's consider the actual values.
Fri: -1, Sat: -4, Sun: 0, Mon: 0, Tue: 3, Wed: -3, Thu: -5

B) -1, -4, 0, 0, 3, -3, -5 corresponds accurately
C) -1, -4, 0, 0, 3, -3, -5 corresponds accurately
D) -1, -4, 0, 0, 3, -3, -5 corresponds accurately
E) -1, -4, 0, 0, 3, -3, -5 corresponds accurately

Let's check how the temperatures increase/decrease between days.
Fri to Sat: -1 to -4 (decrease of 3)
Sat to Sun: -4 to 0 (increase of 4)
Sun to Mon: 0 to 0 (constant)
Mon to Tue: 0 to 3 (increase of 3)
Tue to Wed: 3 to -3 (decrease of 6)
Wed to Thu: -3 to -5 (decrease of 2)

The correct answer is (B) because it shows an initial decrease from Friday (-1°C) to Saturday (-4°C), then increases from Saturday to Sunday (0°C) and stays constant on Monday (0°C), then increases to Tuesday (3°C) and decreases from Tuesday to Wednesday (-3°C) and decreases from Wednesday to Thursday (-5°C).

Answer: B)
