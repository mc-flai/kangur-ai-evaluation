Reasoning: We need to determine which ice cream and topping combination is possible, given the quantities available.
- Vanilla (4) + Umbrellas (4) = 4 combinations possible
- Chocolate (3) + Cherries (3) = 3 combinations possible
- Lemon (2) + Wafers (2) = 2 combinations possible
- Mango (1) + Chocolate Gum (1) = 1 combination possible
Based on the available quantities, we can confirm which combination is possible.
(A) Chocolate and chocolate gum: Chocolate (3), Chocolate Gum (1). Possible.
(B) Mango and cherry: Mango (1), Cherries (3). Possible.
(C) Lemon and wafer: Lemon (2), Wafers (2). Possible.
(D) Mango and wafer: Mango (1), Wafers (2). Possible.
(E) Lemon and cherry: Lemon (2), Cherries (3). Possible.

Let's consider the constraint "Since they don't want two ice creams the same."
That means we must use all of our flavor and topping combinations.
We have the following flavors and toppings and their quantities.
Vanilla (4), Chocolate (3), Lemon (2), Mango (1)
Umbrellas (4), Cherries (3), Wafers (2), Chocolate Gum (1)
We can form:
Vanilla+Umbrella(4)
Chocolate+Cherry(3)
Lemon+Wafer(2)
Mango+Chocolate Gum(1)

Option A: Chocolate + Chocolate gum. Cannot happen.
Option B: Mango + cherry. Cannot happen.
Option C: Lemon + wafer. Can happen.
Option D: Mango + wafer. Cannot happen.
Option E: Lemon + cherry. Cannot happen.

Reasoning: After analyzing all combinations, it is clear that each ice cream has a specific topping.
If we examine the pairings again, we should have the following pairings:
Vanilla and Umbrella (4 pairs)
Chocolate and Cherry (3 pairs)
Lemon and Wafer (2 pairs)
Mango and Chocolate Gum (1 pair)

We need to figure out which combination is possible, which essentially means the correct pairing. This can only be Lemon and wafer.
