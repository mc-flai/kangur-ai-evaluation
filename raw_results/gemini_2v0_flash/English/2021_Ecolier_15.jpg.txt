Reasoning:
The heights of the three ladders shown are 32, 36, and 48. Observe the pattern of how the ladders are constructed. Each rung represents a height.
The number of rungs for the ladders of height 32, 36, and 48 are proportional to their height. By observing the picture, there are 8 sections of the ladder for 32, and 9 sections for 36. Thus 32/8 = 4, and 36/9 = 4. Therefore each section of ladder is 4. The first ladder has 3 sections, which equates to 3 * 4 = 12.

Answer: A)
