Reasoning:
Let the radius of each small cylinder be $r$ and the height be $h$. Then the volume of each small cylinder is $V = \pi r^2 h$.
When the curved surfaces are cut open and joined together, the height of the new cylinder is still $h$, but the radius becomes $2r$.
The volume of the new cylinder is $V_{new} = \pi (2r)^2 h = \pi (4r^2) h = 4 \pi r^2 h = 4V$.
Therefore, the volume of the resulting cylinder is 4 times as big as the volume of one of the small cylinders.
