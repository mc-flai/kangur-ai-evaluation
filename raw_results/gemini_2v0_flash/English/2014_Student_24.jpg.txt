Reasoning: Let the side length of the square be $s$. The radius of each circle is 1. Let us draw a line from the center of one of the circles to the point where the circle touches the top of the square. This line has length 1. Let us also draw a line from the center of the circle perpendicular to the side of the square. This line has length $1-s$. The horizontal distance from the center of the circle to the side of the square is $s/2$. Thus, we can write
$$(1-s)^2 + (s/2)^2 = 1^2$$
$$1 - 2s + s^2 + s^2/4 = 1$$
$$s^2 + s^2/4 - 2s = 0$$
$$5s^2/4 - 2s = 0$$
$$s(5s/4 - 2) = 0$$
Since $s \neq 0$,
$$5s/4 = 2$$
$$s = 8/5$$
None of the answers are equal to $8/5$. However, let the distance from the center of the circle to the tangent be 1. Let the side length of the square be $x$. Drop a perpendicular from the centre of one of the circles to the top side of the square. The length of this perpendicular is $1-x$. Draw a line joining the center of this circle to the top vertex of the square. The length of this line is 1 since this is the radius of the circle. Then using Pythagoras theorem we have $(1-x)^2 + (x/2)^2 = 1^2$. So $1 - 2x + x^2 + x^2/4 = 1$. Thus $5x^2/4 = 2x$. This means $x = 8/5$.

Let's consider a coordinate system with the tangent line being the x-axis and the y-axis passing through the center of the left circle. Then the center of the left circle is (0,1) and the center of the right circle is (2,1). Let the coordinates of the top left vertex of the square be (a,x) and the coordinates of the top right vertex be (a+x,x). Since these lie on the circles,
$a^2 + (x-1)^2 = 1$
$(a+x-2)^2 + (x-1)^2 = 1$
Thus $a^2 = (a+x-2)^2$. This means $a = 2-a-x$ or $a = a+x-2$. The second case gives $x=2$, which is not possible.
So $2a = 2-x$ or $a = 1 - x/2$. Substituting this in the equation $a^2 + (x-1)^2 = 1$, we have
$(1-x/2)^2 + (x-1)^2 = 1$
$1 - x + x^2/4 + x^2 - 2x + 1 = 1$
$x^2/4 + x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0$
$5x^2/4 - 3x + 1 = 0$
$5x^2 - 12x + 4 = 0$
$x = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144 - 80}}{10} = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{64}}{10} = \frac{12 \pm 8}{10}$
$x = \frac{20}{10} = 2$ or $x = \frac{4}{10} = 2/5$. Since $x \neq 2$, $x=2/5$.

Reasoning:
We set up the problem as follows: Let the side length of the square be $s$. Consider the circle on the left. Let its center be at (0, 1). The vertex of the square on that circle has coordinates (a, s) where $a < 0$. The equation of the circle is $x^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1$.
So $a^2 + (s-1)^2 = 1$, or $a^2 = 1 - (s-1)^2 = 1 - (s^2 - 2s + 1) = 2s - s^2$. Thus $a = -\sqrt{2s - s^2}$.
The coordinates of the center of the right circle is (2, 1). The right vertex of the square on this circle is at (a+s, s).
Thus $(a+s - 2)^2 + (s-1)^2 = 1$, so $(a+s - 2)^2 = 2s - s^2$. Taking the square root gives $a+s - 2 = \pm \sqrt{2s - s^2}$.
We have $a = -\sqrt{2s - s^2}$, so $-\sqrt{2s - s^2} + s - 2 = \pm \sqrt{2s - s^2}$.
If $-\sqrt{2s - s^2} + s - 2 = \sqrt{2s - s^2}$, then $s-2 = 2\sqrt{2s - s^2}$.
Then $s^2 - 4s + 4 = 4(2s - s^2)$, or $s^2 - 4s + 4 = 8s - 4s^2$, so $5s^2 - 12s + 4 = 0$.
$(5s - 2)(s - 2) = 0$, so $s = 2/5$ or $s = 2$.
If $-\sqrt{2s - s^2} + s - 2 = -\sqrt{2s - s^2}$, then $s - 2 = 0$, so $s = 2$.
Thus $s = 2/5$.
