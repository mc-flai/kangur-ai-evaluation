Reasoning: The goal is to find the balloon that Mia *definitely* hits. Let's try different combinations of balloons that add up to 30.
- 18 + 9 + 3 = 30. This combination includes 18, 9, and 3.
- 13 + 14 + 3 = 30. This combination includes 13, 14, and 3.
- 9 + 13 + x doesn't equal 30 if x is one of the balloons
- 13 + 14 + 3= 30.
- 9 + 3 +18 =30

We see that the only balloon that appears in every possible combination that adds to 30 is the '3' balloon. Let's test this out.

If Mia didn't hit the '3' balloon, then let's see the combinations that can make up 30.

18 + 14 is already 32 which is greater than 30.
18 + 13 is also greater than 30.
18+ 9 is 27
14+ 13, 14+ 9, 13+9 doesn't sum to 30.

However if we use two throws that will make up to 30, we can have 18+12(which we don't have), or if we don't have 3, then we can't get to 30 because none of the combination will result to 30.

Therefore, if we choose any number of balloons, we'll see that to reach 30 definitely, Mia must hit balloon '3'.
