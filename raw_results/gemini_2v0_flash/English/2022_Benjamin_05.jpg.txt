Reasoning: To minimize the number of packages, Tom should buy as many packages of 25 as possible.
- Three packages of 25 would give 75 marbles (3 x 25 = 75).
- This leaves 20 marbles to buy (95 - 75 = 20).
- Two packages of 10 will equal 20 marbles (2 x 10 = 20).
- The total number of packages is 3 (packages of 25) + 2 (packages of 10) = 5 packages.
- Trying any other combination will result in more packages.

Answer: B)
