Reasoning:
Tania bought 14 chocolates in total.
8 were round, so 14 - 8 = 6 were square.
Half were white, and half were dark, meaning 14 / 2 = 7 were dark.
Of the 6 square chocolates, only 2 are not white, meaning that 2 square chocolates are dark.
Since there are 7 dark chocolates and 2 of them are square, then 7 - 2 = 5 are dark round chocolates.
