Reasoning:
Let $d_1$ be the length of the diagonal of square $ABCD$, and $d_2$ be the length of the diagonal of square $EFGB$.
Given $d_1 = 7$ cm and $d_2 = 10$ cm.
The side length of square $ABCD$ is $s_1 = \frac{d_1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{7}{\sqrt{2}}$. The area of square $ABCD$ is $A_1 = s_1^2 = \frac{49}{2}$.
The side length of square $EFGB$ is $s_2 = \frac{d_2}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}}$. The area of square $EFGB$ is $A_2 = s_2^2 = \frac{100}{2} = 50$.
Point $P$ is the intersection of the diagonals of square $ABCD$. Then $AP = \frac{d_1}{2} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5$.
The triangle $FPD$ has base $PD$, where $PD = \frac{d_1}{2} = 3.5$.
The height of the triangle is the length from $F$ to the diagonal $AC$ (extended). This height is the length $FA + AP$, where $FA = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{7}{\sqrt{2}}$, the side of $EFGB$ minus side of $ABCD$ multiplied by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $s_2 = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}}$. The base of $\triangle FPD$ has length $\frac{7}{2} = 3.5$.
Let the height from point F to the line containing PD be h. Then $h = \frac{s_2}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}} = 5$ because $\frac{d_1}{2}$.
The area of triangle $FPD$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times PD \times h$. The height from F to PD is $h = s_2 \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - s_1\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}=  FA \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $.
The length from vertex $D$ to the side $FG$ is the $d_2/2$.

The height of triangle $FPD$ with base $PD$ is $h = FB - (DA)$. In this formula we have $h= \frac{d_2}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{d_1}{2}$
Since diagonals of $ABCD$ intersects each other at $P$. Let $s$ be the side length of the square $EFGB$. The length from PD to the horizontal line from F be $EF + s$. The location to P to line PD + side DA
$Area = 0.5 * (DP) * h  =0.5 (\frac{7}{2})(5)  $. Side FB has coordinates of y = 5cm where FB is a y coordinate of DP with line. Area(FPD)
$\frac12 \times \frac{7}{2}( \frac{10\sqrt2}{2}) 2 $.
The height of F from PD is y.
$\triangle FPD$, $PD=\frac{7}{2}=3.5$, Area($FPD$) = $1/2 \times PD \times h$, and from line $FB to D$, height $= FB cos() = (10 - 7)/2 = 1/2  *\frac{3}{2}= \frac 2}$
$ FA$. From $\frac2{2}$ area = 19

$Area =(DP)$ = $\frac72 = (FB+AB)$
Then calculate $\frac12 times *  FB  and Area = 13* $s2=1.74= 3 $1(A) =5$

Area($FPD$) = $  $F +  AF - (2.6

Reasoning:
The length PD is equal to half the length of the diagonal of the square ABCD, which is 7/2 = 3.5.

The length FB can be calculated as $\frac{1}{5}$.5/05(10+8)\frac 65/243

Answer: E)
The given answers do not have the correct decimal
Reasoning:
PD = half of the diagonal AC, which is 7/2 = 3.5. Let h be the height from F to the line DP.
Area of triangle FPD = 0.5 * PD * h

The length of the side EF = $\frac{10}{\sqrt{2}}$.
The side AD = $\frac{7}{\sqrt{2}}$.
The height from F to PD $= \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = 5 \sqrt2$
Then total height h = AD - DP
