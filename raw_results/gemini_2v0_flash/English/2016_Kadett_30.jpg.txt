Reasoning: The cube has 15 black and 12 white unit cubes. Each face of the cube consists of 9 unit squares. In total there should be $15/9=1.66$ black color and $12/9=1.33$ white color, so this cube has more black color unit squares. Looking at the provided five faces, there are a total of $5 \times 9 = 45$ unit squares.
Count the number of black and white unit squares among the 5 faces:
Face 1: 6 black, 3 white
Face 2: 4 black, 5 white
Face 3: 5 black, 4 white
Face 4: 3 black, 6 white
Face 5: 6 black, 3 white
Total black: $6+4+5+3+6=24$
Total white: $3+5+4+6+3=21$
We know there are 15 black and 12 white unit cubes, so there is $15-24/3=7$ black unit squares and $12-21/3 = 5$ white unit squares on the face of the cube. Thus there must be $15 - 24 = -9$ and $12 - 21 = -9$, therefore this approach cannot work, also this is not a perfect black or perfect white cubes because $15/27$ is not equal to $12/27$.
If we assume that the six faces form a uniform pattern of black and white. Then the numbers of black and white in total will be $15 \times 6 = 90$, and $12 \times 6 = 72$.
If we sum the number of black colors of 5 faces, we have $6+4+5+3+6=24$.
Thus the last face requires: $15\times 6/6 - 24 = 15-24=-9$, but this cannot be true. The approach is wrong. Instead, we are looking for patterns.
Face 1 can be converted to Face 5 by 90 degree rotations. Face 3 looks the "average" shape, Face 2 and 4 can become same after rotations. Face 1 and 5 looks the same from the figure.

Let's eliminate those faces whose numbers of black and white are too extreme. Face 3 looks the same, and Face 1 has a small white.
The number of black is 15 and number of white is 12, so the cube has slightly more black units.
Then each face should contain roughly $15/6 = 2.5$ black, or it must contain $12/6 = 2$ white.
Sum all the values of each unit cubes as a total: $15 + 12 = 27$ unit cubes.
Sum all black: 24 unit cubes, then black on last side $15 - \text{(number of blacks)}$. Sum all white: 21. The last side should have $12 - \text{(number of whites)}$ white.
Thus if we consider 5 faces: 24 blacks and 21 whites. This implies that one last faces can have 3 blacks and 6 whites. From the given options, A: 6 black, 3 white. B: 5 black, 4 white. C: 4 black, 5 white. D: 4 black, 5 white. E: 5 black, 4 white.
If we consider a dice with opposite faces sums up to 7. Then we can look for an appropriate patterns. From the diagram, it is impossible to find an exact pattern.

However the number of white and blacks should be 3 and 6, so the possible candidates are (D) and (E). If we compare the patterns. The correct configuration should be (E)
Reasoning:
Answer: E)
