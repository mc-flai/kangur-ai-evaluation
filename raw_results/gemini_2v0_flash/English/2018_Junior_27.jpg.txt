Reasoning:
Imagine cutting the cube with the holes through its center, perpendicular to a space diagonal. The space diagonal connects opposite corners of the 3x3x3 cube. The plane will intersect the outer faces of the cube and also the inner faces of the holes. Due to the symmetry and the positions of the removed cubes, the cross section will be a hexagon. Also since the plane cuts through the middle of each void, we will have a smaller hexagonal shape in the middle, resulting in answer choice B.

Answer: B)
