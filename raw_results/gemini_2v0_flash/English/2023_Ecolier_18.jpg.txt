Reasoning: The paper is folded twice, so when it is unfolded, the cut will be reflected across both folds. This means there will be a cut in each corner of the square. The shape of the cut is a triangle, so when unfolded, it forms a square (Option A) or a diamond (Option B). If you look closely at the cut being made, it is perpendicular to the edge of the folded paper. When unfolded it would result in a square in the middle of the paper. So option A is the correct answer.

Answer: A)
