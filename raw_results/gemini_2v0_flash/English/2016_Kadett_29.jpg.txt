Reasoning:
Let $n_i$ be the number of passengers in carriage $i$, where $i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.
Two passengers are neighbors if they are in the same carriage or in two successive carriages.
Each passenger has either 5 or 10 neighbors.

Consider the case where $n_i = 3$ for all $i$. Then the total number of passengers is 15.
If $n_1 = 3$, then each of the 3 passengers in carriage 1 has $2 + n_2 = 2 + 3 = 5$ neighbors.
If $n_2 = 3$, then each of the 3 passengers in carriage 2 has $2 + n_1 + n_3 = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8$ neighbors. This does not work.
If $n_3 = 3$, then each of the 3 passengers in carriage 3 has $2 + n_2 + n_4 = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8$ neighbors. This does not work.
If $n_4 = 3$, then each of the 3 passengers in carriage 4 has $2 + n_3 + n_5 = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8$ neighbors. This does not work.
If $n_5 = 3$, then each of the 3 passengers in carriage 5 has $2 + n_4 = 2 + 3 = 5$ neighbors.

Consider the case where each $n_i = x$ for some $x$.
A passenger in carriage 1 has $x-1 + n_2$ neighbors.
A passenger in carriage 2 has $x-1 + n_1 + n_3$ neighbors.
A passenger in carriage 3 has $x-1 + n_2 + n_4$ neighbors.
A passenger in carriage 4 has $x-1 + n_3 + n_5$ neighbors.
A passenger in carriage 5 has $x-1 + n_4$ neighbors.

If $n_i = x$, a passenger in carriage 1 has $x-1+x = 2x-1$ neighbors. This must be either 5 or 10.
$2x-1=5 \Rightarrow 2x=6 \Rightarrow x=3$. Total passengers = $5x = 15$.
If $x=3$, a passenger in carriage 2 has $2+x-1+x = 2x+1 = 7$, so $x \neq 3$.
$2x-1=10 \Rightarrow 2x=11 \Rightarrow x=5.5$, which is not possible.

Let $n_1 = n_5 = x$ and $n_2 = n_3 = n_4 = y$.
A passenger in carriage 1 has $x-1 + y$ neighbors. Thus $x+y-1 = 5$ or $x+y-1 = 10$.
A passenger in carriage 2 has $y-1 + x + y$ neighbors. Thus $x+2y-1 = 5$ or $x+2y-1 = 10$.
The total number of passengers is $2x + 3y$.
If $x+y-1=5$, then $x+y=6$.
If $x+2y-1=5$, then $x+2y=6$. Then $y=0$, but $y \ge 1$.
If $x+y-1=10$, then $x+y=11$.
If $x+2y-1=10$, then $x+2y=11$. Then $y=0$, but $y \ge 1$.

Try the case where the number of neighbors alternate between 5 and 10.
The problem is complex.
By examining the options, let us try $n=15$.
Try $n_1=n_5=2$ and $n_2=n_3=n_4=3$.
Then a passenger in carriage 1 has $1+3=4$. No.

It looks as though the configuration may not exist.
