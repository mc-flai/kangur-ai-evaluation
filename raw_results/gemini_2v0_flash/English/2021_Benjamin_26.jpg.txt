Reasoning:
The problem states that each digit was turned the same amount in the same direction. This means the difference between the original digit and the resulting digit must be the same for all four digits.

Let's analyze each option:
A) 8560 -> 6348
The differences are: 8-6 = 2, 5-3 = 2, 6-4 = 2, 0-8 = -8 (or +2, since we can wrap around). Since we need to have the same turn, 0-8 and 8-6 can both have turned by 2.

B) 3015 -> 6348
The differences are: 3-6 = -3, 0-3 = -3, 1-4 = -3, 5-8 = -3. So this could be the correct original code.

C) 4906 -> 6348
The differences are: 4-6 = -2, 9-3 = 6 or -4, 0-4 = -4, 6-8 = -2. This can't be the correct initial combination.

D) 1893 -> 6348
The differences are: 1-6 = -5, 8-3 = 5, 9-4 = 5, 3-8 = -5. This can't be the correct initial combination.

E) 0782 -> 6348
The differences are: 0-6 = -6, 7-3 = 4 or -6, 8-4 = 4, 2-8 = -6. This can't be the correct initial combination

Now let's analyze these differences considering we can add 10 to make the difference the same.
For example, we can turn the dial forward such that 9+3 = 2, effectively meaning that if we have a turn of +3. Let us consider the cases in which the turn can be the same. We are looking for the case which is the same number of steps of the same direction.
A) 8 to 6 requires -2 or +8; 5 to 3 requires -2 or +8; 6 to 4 requires -2 or +8; 0 to 8 requires -2 or +8. So this CAN be the initial combination.
B) 3 to 6 requires +3 or -7; 0 to 3 requires +3 or -7; 1 to 4 requires +3 or -7; 5 to 8 requires +3 or -7. So this CAN be the initial combination.
C) 4 to 6 requires +2 or -8; 9 to 3 requires +4 or -6; 0 to 4 requires +4 or -6; 6 to 8 requires +2 or -8. So this CANNOT be the initial combination.
D) 1 to 6 requires +5 or -5; 8 to 3 requires -5 or +5; 9 to 4 requires -5 or +5; 3 to 8 requires +5 or -5. So this CAN be the initial combination.
E) 0 to 6 requires +6 or -4; 7 to 3 requires -4 or +6; 8 to 4 requires -4 or +6; 2 to 8 requires +6 or -4. So this CAN be the initial combination.

The differences in option C are not consistent, which means this CANNOT be the initial code.

Answer: C)
