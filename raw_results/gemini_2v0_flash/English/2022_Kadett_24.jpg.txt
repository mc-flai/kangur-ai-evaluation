Reasoning: Let 'd' be the one-way distance from home to school.  Then 2d is the total distance from home to school and back.
Time by bike = 20 minutes for 2d.
Time by foot = 60 minutes for 2d.
Let 'x' be the distance from home to Eva's house.
On the way to school, he biked 'x' and walked 'd-x'.
On the way back, he walked 'd-x' and biked 'x'.
Total time = (time biking x) + (time walking d-x) + (time walking d-x) + (time biking x) = 52 minutes.

Since time = distance/speed and speed is distance/time, we can consider the time it takes him to complete the distance.
Time to bike distance x = (x/2d)*20
Time to walk distance d-x = ((d-x)/2d)*60

Total time = (x/2d)*20 + ((d-x)/2d)*60 + ((d-x)/2d)*60 + (x/2d)*20 = 52
=> (20x + 60d - 60x + 60d - 60x + 20x) / 2d = 52
=> (-120x + 120d) / 2d = 52
=> -120x + 120d = 104d
=> 16d = 120x
=> x = 16d/120
=> x = 2d/15
Total bike distance = x + x = 2x = 4d/15.  The fraction of the total distance he biked is (4d/15) / 2d = 4/30 = 2/15.

This is incorrect. Let's approach differently.
Let Tb = time taken to bike to school, Tw = time taken to walk to school
2Tb = 20 so Tb = 10
2Tw = 60 so Tw = 30.
Yesterday: biked to Eva's (time = t1), walked to school (time = t2), walked to Eva's (time = t3), biked home (time = t4).
t1 + t2 + t3 + t4 = 52

Let fraction of distance to Eva's house be f.
t1 = f * Tb = 10f
t2 = (1-f) * Tw = 30(1-f)
t3 = (1-f) * Tw = 30(1-f)
t4 = f * Tb = 10f
Total time = 20f + 60(1-f) = 52
20f + 60 - 60f = 52
-40f = -8
f = 1/5

Fraction of journey by bike = (f + f)/2 = f = 1/5 (the total distance to school and back is 2, thus, normalize it by 2)

Reasoning: Let d be the distance from home to school.
Bike time to school + back = 20 min => bike speed = 2d/20 = d/10
Walk time to school + back = 60 min => walk speed = 2d/60 = d/30
Let x be the distance from home to Eva's house.
Time biking to Eva's = x/(d/10) = 10x/d
Time walking to school = (d-x)/(d/30) = 30(d-x)/d
Time walking to Eva's = (d-x)/(d/30) = 30(d-x)/d
Time biking home = x/(d/10) = 10x/d
Total time = 10x/d + 30(d-x)/d + 30(d-x)/d + 10x/d = 52
(10x + 30d - 30x + 30d - 30x + 10x)/d = 52
(-40x + 60d)/d = 52
-40x + 60d = 52d
8d = 40x
x = d/5
Total bike distance = x + x = 2x = 2d/5
Part of journey by bike = (2d/5) / 2d = 1/5

Answer: B)
