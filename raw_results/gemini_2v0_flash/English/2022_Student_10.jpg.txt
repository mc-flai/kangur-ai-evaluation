Reasoning: Let's analyze the given information and the question. We are given that points A, B, C, and D are in that order on a line. Also, AC = 12 cm and BD = 18 cm. We want to find the distance between the midpoints of AB and CD. Let M be the midpoint of AB and N be the midpoint of CD.

Let's denote the position of A as 0. Then C is at 12. Let the position of B be x. Then D is at x + 18. Since the points are in order A, B, C, D, we must have 0 < x < 12 < x + 18. This means x can be any value between 0 and 12.
The midpoint M of AB is at x/2.
The midpoint N of CD is at (12 + x + 18)/2 = (30 + x)/2 = 15 + x/2.
The distance between M and N is |(15 + x/2) - x/2| = |15| = 15.
The distance between M and N is always 15 cm, regardless of the position of B (as long as the order is A, B, C, D).
