Let $P(a)$ be the probability that A wins when A is $a$ points ahead. We are given that $P(3) = 1$ and $P(-3) = 0$. We want to find $P(1)$.

Since each player has an equal probability of winning each point, we can write the following equation:
$P(a) = \frac{1}{2} P(a+1) + \frac{1}{2} P(a-1)$
Multiplying by 2, we get:
$2P(a) = P(a+1) + P(a-1)$
Rearranging the terms, we have:
$P(a+1) - P(a) = P(a) - P(a-1)$
This means the difference between consecutive probabilities is constant. Let this constant be $d$. Then:
$P(a+1) = P(a) + d$
$P(a-1) = P(a) - d$

We know that $P(3) = 1$ and $P(-3) = 0$. We can express $P(a)$ in terms of $P(0)$ and $d$.
$P(3) = P(0) + 3d = 1$
$P(-3) = P(0) - 3d = 0$
Adding these two equations, we get:
$2P(0) = 1$, so $P(0) = \frac{1}{2}$.
Substituting this into the first equation:
$\frac{1}{2} + 3d = 1$
$3d = \frac{1}{2}$
$d = \frac{1}{6}$
Now we can find $P(1)$:
$P(1) = P(0) + d = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$

Reasoning: We set up a recursive relationship for the probability that A wins based on A's current lead. Then, we recognized that the probability changes linearly with the lead and solved for the unknowns. Finally, we calculated P(1).
