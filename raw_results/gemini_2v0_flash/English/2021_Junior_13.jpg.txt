Reasoning:
Let the numbers in the intersections be a, b, c, d, e, and f, with 'f' being the number at the question mark.
We know that one number is 6, say a = 6. The other numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
The sums of the numbers on each ring are the same. Let the sum be S.
Since the total sum of numbers 1 to 6 is 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21, we have 3S = 21 + a + b + c = 21 + 6 + b + c = 27 + b + c.
Since 3S is a multiple of 3, 27+b+c must be a multiple of 3, which means b+c must be a multiple of 3.
The possible pairs (b, c) such that b+c is a multiple of 3 and b,c are chosen from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are:
(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 5). Since 6 is already used, we only consider: (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 4), (4, 5).
Now, also note that b and c must not be 6 since 6 has been already used.
If b=1, c=2, then the remaining numbers are 3, 4, 5.
If b=1, c=5, then the remaining numbers are 2, 3, 4.
If b=2, c=4, then the remaining numbers are 1, 3, 5.
If b=4, c=5, then the remaining numbers are 1, 2, 3.
Consider the case where b=1 and c=2. S = (27+1+2)/3 = 30/3 = 10.
So each circle sum is 10. The numbers used are 1, 2, 6. The unused numbers are 3, 4, 5.
Let the remaining numbers be d, e, f (3, 4, 5). So 6 + d + e = 10, 1 + e + f = 10, 2 + d + f = 10.
d + e = 4, e + f = 9, d + f = 8. d, e, f are 3, 4, 5 in some order. d, e, f cannot be integers.
If d=3, e=1, impossible.
If d=4, e=0, impossible.
If d=5, e=-1, impossible.
Consider b=1, c=5, then the remaining numbers are 2, 3, 4. S = (27+1+5)/3 = 33/3 = 11.
So 6 + d + e = 11, 1 + e + f = 11, 5 + d + f = 11.  d+e = 5, e+f = 10, d+f = 6.
d, e, f are 2, 3, 4 in some order.
If d=2, e=3, f=4. So the number at the question mark is 4.

Reasoning:
Let the numbers at the intersections be x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, 6. Let x1 be the number at question mark.
Let S be the sum of numbers in each ring.
The sum of all the numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21.
The sum of all the rings is 3S = 21 + x1 + x2 + 6 = 27 + x1 + x2. Then, x1 + x2 must be a multiple of 3.
Let x1 be the number at the question mark. Then,
x1 + x3 + x4 = S
x1 + x2 + 6 = S
6 + x5 + x4 = S
Since x1 + x2 + 6 = 6 + x5 + x4, x1 + x2 = x5 + x4. We want to determine what x1 is.
The sum of all the numbers from 1 to 6 is 21.
The sum of each ring is S. There are 3 rings. S = (1/3)*(Sum of all numbers + sum of shared elements).
The sum of the shared numbers is x1 + x4 + 6. The sum of all numbers from 1 to 6 is 21. 3S = 21 + x1 + x4 + 6.
3S = 27 + x1 + x4. 3S - 27 = x1 + x4.
The possibilities for x1 are 1,2,3,4,5. If x1 = 1, x4 must be 2,3,4,5. x1 + x4 can't be 3.
So let's start assuming the sum S = 12. 12 * 3 = 36. Then x1+x2 = 12-6 = 6. and x5+x4 = 6.
x1 + x3 + x4 = S. So we need to place numbers in the rings such that x1 + x2 = 6, and x5+x4 = 6.
if x1 = 4, then x2 = 2. The remaining are 1,3,5. x5+x4=6. So 1 and 5, or 5 and 1. 6 + 5 + x4 = 12
x1 = 4, x3, x4 ->
1 to 6
