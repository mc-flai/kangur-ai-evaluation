Reasoning:
Eva enters through the main entrance (5), and each room she enters must have a higher number than the previous one.

One possible path to the exit is:
5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 (E). The door would be E.

Another possible path is:
5 -> 9 -> 10 -> 12 (E). The door would be E.

Another possible path is:
5 -> 6 -> 8 -> 9 -> 12 (E). The door would be E.

There are probably other possible paths, but the door in the final position is always going to be E.

Answer: E)
