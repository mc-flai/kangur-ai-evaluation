Reasoning: We are given four people (Sandra, Benjamin, Eva, and Philipp) sitting around a table doing four different sports (ice skating, skiing, hockey, and sledging). We want to know which sport Eva plays.

*   The skier sits to the left of Sandra.
*   The ice skater sits opposite Benjamin.
*   Eva and Philipp sit next to each other.
*   A woman sits next to the person who plays hockey.

The genders are not specified for Sandra or Benjamin. Either Sandra or Benjamin is a woman. Eva sits next to Philipp, so if we know anything about Philipp's sport, it can lead us to what is next to Eva. The question asks which sport Eva plays. So we are not worried what sport is next to Eva.
Since we don't know which of the four sports Sandra and Benjamin play, and we don't have any other constraints linking them to Eva or Philipp we cannot know which sport Eva plays.

Answer: E)
