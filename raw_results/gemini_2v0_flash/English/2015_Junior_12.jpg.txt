Reasoning:
The problem asks for the shortest path from "Start" to "Ziel" moving only along the sides and diagonals of the squares. The grid is a 3x2 grid.
If we move along the sides only, the distance is 3 + 2 = 5. This is not among the options.
If we move along the diagonal, the length of the diagonal of each square is $\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}$.
We want to use as many diagonals as possible.
Let's consider moving 2 diagonals down. That takes us two squares to the right. Then we move one unit to the right and zero units vertically. Then we move two units down. The distance would be $2\sqrt{2} + 1 + 0 = 1 + 2\sqrt{2}$.
Let's consider moving 2 units horizontally and two units vertically in separate paths. In that case, we move 2 units horizontally and 2 units vertically. That's a distance of 2+2 = 4.
Consider moving along the longest diagonal possible. This would be a line of length $\sqrt{3^2+2^2} = \sqrt{9+4} = \sqrt{13}$.
Consider the path moving along 2 diagonals and then moving horizontally to reach the goal. Moving along 2 diagonals has the distance $2\sqrt{2}$. We will arrive at the coordinates (2,2). We need to move one unit horizontally to reach the x-coordinate of 3. That is one unit right. The distance is $2\sqrt{2} + 1$.
Now, let's examine the given options:
A) $2\sqrt{5} \approx 2 \cdot 2.236 = 4.472$
B) $\sqrt{10} + \sqrt{2} \approx 3.162 + 1.414 = 4.576$
C) $2 + 2\sqrt{2} \approx 2 + 2(1.414) = 2 + 2.828 = 4.828$
D) $4\sqrt{2} \approx 4(1.414) = 5.656$
E) 6

From Start to Ziel, we have to move 3 units horizontally and 2 units vertically. If we move 2 diagonals, the path is $2\sqrt{2}+1 \approx 3.828$. The given options have the smallest value as $2\sqrt{5} = 4.472$.
Another possible route is to go along the diagonal to the coordinate (2,1), with length $\sqrt{(2-0)^2 + (1-0)^2} = \sqrt{4+1} = \sqrt{5}$. Then we move along the diagonal (1,1) to (3,2), the goal, with length $\sqrt{2}$. Then the total length is $\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{2}$.
Let's try to move along two diagonals first. We have traveled $\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2}$. We are now two units to the right and two units down. We have to move one unit to the right. So the distance is $2\sqrt{2}+1$. This value is less than all the provided options, so we should compare $2\sqrt{2} + 1$ with the options.
$\sqrt{2} \approx 1.4$.
$2\sqrt{2} + 1 \approx 2(1.4) + 1 = 3.8$.
However, since we can only move along the sides or diagonals of the squares, we must move 2 units down and 3 units to the right. We can combine this by using diagonals. Try using one long diagonal from $(0,0)$ to $(3,2)$. $\sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (2-0)^2} = \sqrt{3^2+2^2} = \sqrt{13} = 3.6$. Still less than all options.
It turns out that we should have used $\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{2} \approx 2.2 + 1.4 = 3.6$.
However $\sqrt{13} = \sqrt{(2^2+1) + 9} \approx 3.6$.
Let's move along diagonals for as long as possible. The total distance would be 6 units if we only move along sides. The goal of this question is to move along the sides and diagonals of the squares. $2+2\sqrt{2}=4.828$ is the shortest distance if we move two diagonal squares. If we combine $\sqrt{10}+\sqrt{2}$ we move along one diagonal square.
$2+2\sqrt{2}$

Reasoning:
From Start to Ziel, if you only move right and down, you have to move 3 squares to the right and 2 squares down.
If you only move along the sides, the distance is 3 + 2 = 5. Since 5 is less than 6 (option E), the answer can't be E.
Consider option C: 2+2sqrt(2) = 2+2(1.414) = 2 + 2.828 = 4.828
Move down one, move right 1, move down one, then move right twice (diagonals and edges), then length = sqrt(2) + 1 + sqrt(2) +2(1), giving 2+ 2sqrt(2) + 1
shortest path. 3 adjacent squares.

Answer: C)
