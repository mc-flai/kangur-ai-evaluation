Reasoning:
Let's break down the information given:
* Total animals = 24
* Dogs = (1/8) * 24 = 3
* Not cows = (3/4) * 24 = 18.  This means cows = 24 - 18 = 6.
* Not cats = (2/3) * 24 = 16. This means cats = 24 - 16 = 8.

Now we know the number of dogs, cows and cats.  We can find the number of kangaroos by subtracting these from the total number of animals:
Kangaroos = Total - Dogs - Cows - Cats = 24 - 3 - 6 - 8 = 7
