Reasoning:
We want to find how many integers n make |n^2 - 2n - 3| a prime number.
First, factor the quadratic: n^2 - 2n - 3 = (n - 3)(n + 1).
So, we are looking for |(n - 3)(n + 1)| to be a prime number.

For |(n - 3)(n + 1)| to be a prime number, either |n - 3| = 1 or |n + 1| = 1. Also, either (n-3) or (n+1) must be the factor whose absolute value equals 1, and the other factor must equal $\pm p$ where $p$ is a prime number.

Case 1: |n - 3| = 1
n - 3 = 1  => n = 4. Then |(4-3)(4+1)| = |1 * 5| = 5, which is prime.
n - 3 = -1 => n = 2. Then |(2-3)(2+1)| = |-1 * 3| = 3, which is prime.

Case 2: |n + 1| = 1
n + 1 = 1 => n = 0. Then |(0-3)(0+1)| = |-3 * 1| = 3, which is prime.
n + 1 = -1 => n = -2. Then |(-2-3)(-2+1)| = |-5 * -1| = 5, which is prime.

So, we have found 4 integers n such that |n^2 - 2n - 3| is prime: n = 4, 2, 0, -2.

Thus, there are 4 such integers.
