Reasoning: By carefully examining the surrounding tiles, we can deduce the connections that the missing tile should make. Starting from the top left tile with a black line that ends in the upper left corner, we can see that we need a piece with a black line in the upper left. Moving to the top right tile, we can see that there is a light-grey line in the top right corner, so the piece should have a light-grey line in that corner. And going to the bottom corner we can see the dark gray line going to the left, so this rules out A, B, D. Comparing C and E, C contains an extra black segment making it incorrect, thus E should be correct.

Answer: E)
