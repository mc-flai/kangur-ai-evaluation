Reasoning:
We need to find a digit to put in the gray box such that the sum is correct. We can test each of the answer choices to see which one works.

A) If the gray box is 2, we need to find digits to fill in the other boxes such that:
   _ _ + _ _ = _ _2.
   We can try, for example:
   10 + 32 = 42. But we need to use digits from 0 to 6 only once. Also, we have only two digit numbers to add.
   Let's try 51 + 41 = 92. This doesn't fit because we can only use digits 0-6 and only once.
   Let's try 50 + 12 = 62. This works!
   So 2 is a possible answer.

B) If the gray box is 3, we need to find digits to fill in the other boxes such that:
   _ _ + _ _ = _ _3.
   Let's try 60 + 13 = 73. That works!

C) If the gray box is 4, we need to find digits to fill in the other boxes such that:
   _ _ + _ _ = _ _4.
   Let's try 60 + 14 = 74. That works!

D) If the gray box is 5, we need to find digits to fill in the other boxes such that:
   _ _ + _ _ = _ _5.
   Let's try 60 + 15 = 75. That works!

E) If the gray box is 6, we need to find digits to fill in the other boxes such that:
   _ _ + _ _ = _ _6.
   Let's try 50 + 16 = 66. This doesn't fit because we can only use each digit once. We can try 40 + 26 = 66. This also doesn't fit.
   Let's try 30 + 46 = 76. That works!

Since only one answer is correct, we have to go back and figure out which choice allows only that number in the gray box.

Let's test some cases where the grey box is 0. Then we have _ _ + _ _ = _ _0. Then the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are still unused.
Say we try putting 1 into the tens place of one number. So we have 1_ + 2_ = 30. Then we need to pick 4, 5, and 6, but they cannot sum to 20. So, 1 and 2 cannot be in the tens column.
Let's try using larger numbers. Say, 5_ + 1_ = 60. To make it sum to 0, we need something to add to 60. That's not possible.
If we try 54 + 16 = 70, it doesn't work since 7 isn't in our range.
Let's try to prove 5 is the only value for the box. If the ones digits don't carry over, we have A + B = 5. The possibilities are
(0, 5) X
(1, 4) -> AB + CD = EF5. 23 + 14 = 37 doesn't work since 3 is used twice.
(2, 3) -> AB + CD = EF5.
What if we have a carry over?
Let's analyze it with algebra.
10A + B + 10C + D = 10E + 5. The digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 must appear somewhere in the digits. So B + D either equals 5 or 15 (with a carry over).

If it's just 5, then AB + CD = EF5. Let's try to make 60 + 15 = 75. We have a 7. Does 7 + something + something = _5. It's impossible.
If it adds to 15, then the tens place would be E+1. Let's try finding what that is. So D + B = 15.
The only two numbers between 0-6 that do this are 6 + 9 (too big) or...
Let's consider the case that the box is 3. We have 60 + 13 = 73, but then we end up using 7, which is not allowed.

Let the numbers be A, B, C, D, E, F. Since 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are used and we have A + B = C. The possibilities we get for A + B are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
61 + 02 = 63 Nope!
If the ones digit is 5, then we have a few possibilites:
14 + X_5, 60 + X_5
30 + 25 = 55 Nope!
Let's consider if gray box = 3, can the other cases be correct?
I will start with an example: 36 + 4 = 40
46 + 5 = 51 NO

Reasoning: The question asks us to fill the boxes with digits 0 to 6, each digit used once. We are trying to determine the digit that has to be in the grey box to make the sum correct.

We need to find digits A, B, C, D, E, where A, B, C, D, E are from {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and all distinct. The equation is AB + CD = E(grey).
Trying A) If grey = 2, we get the equation AB + CD = E2. 60 + 12 = 72 uses 7!
Trying B) If grey = 3, we get the equation AB + CD = E3. 50 + 13 = 63. Nice.
Trying C) If grey = 4, we get the equation AB + CD = E4. 50 + 14 = 64. Nice.
Trying D) If grey = 5, we get the equation AB + CD = E5. 40 + 15 = 55 Nope!
Trying E) If grey = 6, we get the equation AB + CD = E6. 50 + 16 = 66.
Consider AB + CD = EF, so A + C = E if no carryover.
But we only care about what goes into the last spot. Then consider. If F = 5, A + C must equal 5. Numbers not used are B + D = E and you can have 1 or 2 digits for each spot.

Consider the gray box value = 5. We have AB + CD = E5. Then A and B must equal 0,1,2,3,4,6. so A + C must equal 5.

Try an example: if grey box = 3, we need digits that don't include 3. Then we can try:

21 + 46 = 67 Nope! The question assumes a carry-over. This implies the number added can only go up to 6, so maybe 1 or 2 carry over. So

Reasoning:
Let's start by testing the possible options, keeping in mind we must use the digits 0-6 only once.

If the gray box contains 5, we have _ _ + _ _ = _ _5. The ones digits of the two added numbers must sum to 5 or 15. The numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 are available to form 4 numbers. For example 60+15,
Also, it doesn't restrict how many digits go in empty boxes before last one.
If the ones digits sum to 5: Possible digit pairs: (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3).
If the ones digits sum to 15: Possible digit pairs: (6, X - Not available - 9), no
If the grey box has 5: 41+62=103 Not possible
if ones place added is equal to 15- impossible

Let the ones digits digits sum to 15.
(2, 3): The result can only be a digit.

Let's choose digit that sum to less than 10: try 0, 1, 2
The box 0 will result = possible value, (3+5), (1+6)=31+50= 81 Not from set digit values
If last digit from 2, 5_7/6 = 12
0_ +1_= number possible
Looking to digits in box, digit only can use ONCE from zero to 6. digit can vary with size box

Answer: A)
Reasoning: I reevaluated and realized if the gray box equals 2 then 50+12 can equal =62 using the numbers 0-6 each number once only.

Answer: A)
Reasoning: 62=50+12 This fits

Answer: A)
The only possible last place is using the values from a set of 0-6 digits once each. Given a question with constraints of using particular digital values, the grey box = 2 and 62 can is satisfied with: 50+12=62 The digits 5,0, 1 6

Answer: A)
Reasoning:
We're given digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 to use in the addition problem with distinct digits for each box. Let the addition problem be AB + CD = EF. What is the digit F (last gray box)?

Consider F = 2. 50 + 12 = 62. A possible answer
Consider F = 3. 60 + 13 = 73. A possible answer
Consider F = 4. 60 + 14 = 74. A possible answer
Consider F = 5. ? + ? = ?5 -> cannot use same again since from 0-6.
Consider F = 6. 40 + 26 = 66.

When F = 5, Then AB+CD = E5. Ones digits (B+D) either equals 5 or 15:
B + D = 5 with values being 0-6, where values do not repeat and not the answer
(0,5) -> already using in answers (0,5) so we cant.
B+ D = 15 is only valid if one digit is >6
15 -
There is NO digit that is uniquely right- The numbers can be 2,3,4,6.
However if there is no number on the left column, and one is at the end, The boxes contain ones digits which must be B+D= F= grey box. So let's try this strategy for the answer. A) 2:
Then 12+ 0 =12.

Answer: D)
Reasoning: Let us examine option 5, The last digits can have the following 0+5; 1+4; 2+3. The remaining are 6 Then A = 6. 100 + 23 gives you something like 3 so 6,

Answer: A)
Reasoning: If gray is A)2, then consider 50+12. This gives the values 62 so correct answer is possible

Answer: A)
Reasoning:
The problem states to use each digit from 0-6 only once. Let's try each option. The sum ends in the digit that goes in the gray box.

(A) 2: 50 + 12 = 62. This is a possible solution.
(B) 3: 60 + 13 = 73. This is a possible solution.
(C) 4: 60 + 14 = 74. This is a possible solution.
(D) 5: 41 + 04 = 45.
(E) 6: There is no arrangement of the digits.

We need to find other restrictions so as not to have this case.

Answer: A)
Reasoning:
A) 50 + 12 =62

Answer: A)
Reasoning: I need to find one of these that is correct if I insert it in the gray box.
If you choose the answer 2 you get 50 + 12 = 62, so each one can be placed in the blank space only one time.
If You Choose The Answer 3 you get 13 +50=63, or 63. You can not use 3 two times. So the answer isn't valid.

Answer: A)
Reasoning: Testing option A: If the gray box is 2, then the sum is XY + ZW = AB2, with X,Y,Z,W,A,B being distinct elements from {0,1,3,4,5,6}.
Then we consider:
1. 50 + 12 = 62. This case gives a solution. The answer is 2.
