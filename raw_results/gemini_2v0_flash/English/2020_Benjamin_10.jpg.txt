Reasoning:
Let's count the number of squares each mouse traverses. The dark mouse travels 6 squares, and the white mouse travels 2 squares. Since they arrive at the same time, the ratio of their speeds is equal to the inverse ratio of the distances traveled. Therefore, the dark mouse's speed divided by the white mouse's speed is equal to the dark mouse's distance divided by the white mouse's distance.
So, 4.5 / white_mouse_speed = 6 / 2
4.5 / white_mouse_speed = 3
white_mouse_speed = 4.5 / 3
white_mouse_speed = 1.5

Answer: B)
