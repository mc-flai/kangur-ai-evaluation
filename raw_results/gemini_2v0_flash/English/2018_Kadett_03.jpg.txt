Reasoning: First, we need to calculate the perimeter of triangle ABC. The perimeter is the sum of its side lengths: 6 cm + 10 cm + 11 cm = 27 cm. Since triangle XYZ is equilateral, all its sides are equal. Let's denote the side length of triangle XYZ as 's'. The perimeter of triangle XYZ is 3s. We know that the perimeter of XYZ is equal to the perimeter of ABC, so 3s = 27 cm. To find the side length 's', we divide both sides of the equation by 3: s = 27 cm / 3 = 9 cm. Therefore, the side lengths of triangle XYZ are 9 cm each.

Answer: B)
