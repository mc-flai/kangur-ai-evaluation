Reasoning:
The problem states that if the card is turned around on the top side, the kangaroo picture is seen. We need to determine what the card would look like if turned around on the right side. This means we are rotating the image 90 degrees clockwise. Looking at the original image, if the card with the kangaroo on top is rotated to the right, the picture of the kangaroo is rotated clockwise by 90 degrees. Comparing the options, the kangaroo in option D is upright and matches with the description of turning the card from the right side.

Answer: D)
