Reasoning:
The cube is composed of 3x3x3 = 27 small cubes. We need to count how many are white, given the alternating pattern described.

Looking at one face of the cube, we can see 5 white squares and 4 gray squares.

Since the cube is made of 3 layers like that, we can visualize the layers.

Top Layer:
5 white squares and 4 gray squares.

Middle Layer:
4 white squares and 5 gray squares.

Bottom Layer:
5 white squares and 4 gray squares.

Adding up, we have 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 white squares.

Answer: D)
