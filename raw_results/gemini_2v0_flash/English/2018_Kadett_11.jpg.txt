Reasoning:
We are given the multiplication problem with some digits painted over: _3 x 2_ = 3_2.
We need to find the values of the painted over digits and sum them. Let the first painted digit be 'a' and the second one be 'b'.
Then, the equation is (10a + 3) x 2 = 300 + 10b + 2. Expanding the left side, we get 20a + 6 = 302 + 10b.  Simplifying further, 20a - 10b = 296.  Dividing by 2 gives 10a - 5b = 148.
Since the numbers are two-digit numbers, 'a' must be a digit from 1-9.
Let's test a few values of 'a' to see if 'b' is an integer between 0-9.

If a = 1, 10 - 5b = 148 => -5b = 138 => b = -138/5. Not an integer.
If a = 2, 20 - 5b = 148 => -5b = 128 => b = -128/5. Not an integer.
If a = 3, 30 - 5b = 148 => -5b = 118 => b = -118/5. Not an integer.
If a = 4, 40 - 5b = 148 => -5b = 108 => b = -108/5. Not an integer.
If a = 5, 50 - 5b = 148 => -5b = 98 => b = -98/5. Not an integer.
If a = 6, 60 - 5b = 148 => -5b = 88 => b = -88/5. Not an integer.
If a = 7, 70 - 5b = 148 => -5b = 78 => b = -78/5. Not an integer.
If a = 8, 80 - 5b = 148 => -5b = 68 => b = -68/5. Not an integer.
If a = 9, 90 - 5b = 148 => -5b = 58 => b = -58/5. Not an integer.
If a = 10, 100 - 5b = 148 => -5b = 48 => b = -48/5. Not an integer.
If a = 11, 110 - 5b = 148 => -5b = 38 => b = -38/5. Not an integer.
If a = 12, 120 - 5b = 148 => -5b = 28 => b = -28/5. Not an integer.
If a = 13, 130 - 5b = 148 => -5b = 18 => b = -18/5. Not an integer.
If a = 14, 140 - 5b = 148 => -5b = 8 => b = -8/5. Not an integer.
If a = 15, 150 - 5b = 148 => -5b = -2 => b = 2/5. Not an integer.

However, if the question meant that _3 * _2 is 3_2, then we can assume it is something like 13 x 26 = 338 (but this doesn't have a 2 at the end of 3_2).

Let's assume the first number is 'a3' and the second number is 'b2', and their product is '3c2'

If we set a=1, and b=2. 13 x 22 = 286 != '3c2'.

If we set a=1 and the first blocked number being '1', and the second being '6', we get:
13 * 62 = 806. Not in form 3_2.

Let us rewrite the question: a3 * b2 = 3c2. Where a,b and c are digits.
Let a = 1.
13 * b2 = 3c2

Then it has to be a number that is around 300/13 = 23.
So b = 2. 13 * 22 = 286
b = 3. 13 * 32 = 416.
Let b = 26. 13 * 26 = 338. a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, a+b+c = 1+2+8 = 11.
Let b = 24. 13 * 24 = 312. a = 1, b = 2, c = 1. a+b+c = 1+2+1 = 4.

If it were 93 * 26 = 2418.
However, it is more likely to be something simpler.

Let us consider 13 * 24 = 312.
In this case, we have digits 1,2,1. The sum is 1+2+1=4
The other digits 3,4,2 are visible.

Consider 11 * 32 = 352. Wrong because there are two digits covered.
Consider 12*32 = 384
So we want something that is between 300 and 400.
Let's try different combinations:

Let x3 * y2 = 3z2 where x, y, z are numbers 0-9.

I think there is a mistake in the question because it seems impossible to find such a case.
Or there should be two possible answers, and we have to sum the smallest one.
If the equation is x3 * x2 = 3x2.
It is possible that the first digit can be 4, since 4 x 4 is close to 3x.

Then 'a' must be close to 30.

Reasoning: We can consider an example such as 11 x 32. I made a wrong interpretation of what digits were covered. It is likely that the digits painted over are digits such that
x3 * y2 = 3z2 is valid, so that some of x, y, or z are same. However, because x and y are the starting of a number, and cannot be zero. So for 1x, y must start with 2, and with 24 will not be a solution.

Reasoning: After careful consideration, it must be 19x12 = 228.
This means 312 - 228 = 84

17 x 18 = 306.

Consider x3 * x6 = 3z8
Reasoning:
Let's think about bounds. Since we are multiplying two two-digit numbers and getting a three-digit number starting with 3, the numbers being multiplied must be relatively small. If we assume the painted digits are a,b,c, we have (10a + 3) * (10b + 2) = 300 + 10c + 2
The answer has to be one of the options. Let's assume the sum is 5. Then a+b+c = 5.
Let us pick some small digits that work for a and b, since most likely the answer is 1,2, and 2 for c.
Or 1 and 1. What would be 3.

Assume 13 * 24 = 312. Then 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. None of the answer options are close to 4.

Another valid set of equation is
14 x 23 = 322. 13x24 - 14x23 = 63
We need 14 x 23 = 322
a = 4
b = 3
c = 2
4+3+2=9

Answer: C)
Reasoning:

If we try 14 * 23 = 322 then a+b+c=4+3+2=9

Answer: C)
