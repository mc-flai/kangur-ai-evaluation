Reasoning: To find the earliest possible date for the third Thursday of March, we need to consider when the first Thursday of March could occur. The earliest the first Thursday can occur is March 1st. If March 1st is a Thursday, then the subsequent Thursdays are March 8th, March 15th, and so on. Therefore, the third Thursday would be 1+7+7 = 15th of March. The first possible Thursday is March 1. In that case, the second Thursday is March 8, and the third Thursday is March 15. Therefore, the earliest possible date is 15/3.
