Reasoning:
Let $x$ be the number of tables with 3 chairs, $y$ be the number of tables with 4 chairs, and $z$ be the number of tables with 6 chairs. We are given that there are a total of 16 tables.
$x + y + z = 16$
We are also given that 36 guests can sit at the tables with 3 or 4 chairs, and the restaurant seats 72 guests in total. This means that:
$3x + 4y = 36$
Also, the total number of guests that can be seated is 72, so:
$3x + 4y + 6z = 72$
Now we have a system of three equations:
1. $x + y + z = 16$
2. $3x + 4y = 36$
3. $3x + 4y + 6z = 72$
Substitute equation (2) into equation (3):
$36 + 6z = 72$
$6z = 72 - 36$
$6z = 36$
$z = 6$
Now substitute $z = 6$ into equation (1):
$x + y + 6 = 16$
$x + y = 10$
Multiply this equation by 3:
$3x + 3y = 30$
We also have $3x + 4y = 36$. Subtract the new equation from this equation:
$(3x + 4y) - (3x + 3y) = 36 - 30$
$y = 6$
Now substitute $y = 6$ into the equation $x + y = 10$:
$x + 6 = 10$
$x = 4$
So, there are 4 tables with 3 chairs, 6 tables with 4 chairs, and 6 tables with 6 chairs.
The number of tables with three chairs is 4.
