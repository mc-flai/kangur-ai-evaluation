Reasoning:
The top view shows 7 squares. The side view shows the heights of the columns.
Let's analyze how we can minimize the number of cubes.
The side view has column heights 2, 1, 2, 3, 2.
We can represent the arrangement in a 3x3 grid. The top view shows where blocks exist.
If we assume the side view is along the columns, we have the following constraints:
Column 1: Height 2
Column 2: Height 1
Column 3: Height 2
Column 4: Height 3
Column 5: Height 2
Let the grid be denoted by (i, j).
From the top view, blocks exist at (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)
The number of cubes is at least 7 since there are 7 filled squares in the top view.
We need to make sure the constraints of the column heights are met, and at the same time, minimize the number of cubes.
Since the blocks at (1,1), (2,1) are in column 1, the height constraint for column 1 is 2, so we already have 2 blocks in column 1.
For column 2, height 1, there is an empty space in the top view.
For column 3, height 2, the blocks at (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) are in column 3, since the height must be 2, we have to choose 2 blocks in column 3.
For column 4, height 3, we only have (3,4), so we need 3 blocks, so add two blocks at (1,4), (2,4).
For column 5, height 2, we only have (3,5), so add one block at (1,5).
We can assume side view represents the heights of row viewed from right side of the grid.
Row 1: height 2
Row 2: height 1
Row 3: height 2
Row 4: height 3
Row 5: height 2
In this assumption we have:
(1,1),(1,3),(2,1),(2,3),(3,3),(3,4),(3,5).
We have at least 7 blocks.
The top view has 7 cubes. We have side view that are 2,1,2,3,2.
Columns must have 2+1+2+3+2 = 10 total. This can be minimal case of minimum is 10.
Reasonable to conclude column representation is better.

Consider the first column: (1,1), (2,1).
Consider the second column: No cube.
Consider the third column: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3).
Consider the fourth column: (3,4).
Consider the fifth column: (3,5).
The heights of columns (from left to right) are 2, 0, 3, 1, 1.
We are given heights 2,1,2,3,2.

Try assigning heights to columns
Columns: 2,1,2,3,2
Locations (i, j) and (row, column) height.

We need to consider it carefully with combination and arrangement of positions and corresponding columns.
After a few tries, the smallest is 12.

Reasoning:
The top view immediately gives a minimum of 7 cubes. The side view is 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, which sums to 10.
Therefore the minimum number of cubes is >= max(7, the minimum required to match profile view, where each entry in the profile view is the max height in the grid).
Construct a 3x5 array representing height such that top view and side view is consistent, we are trying to find the minimum number of cubes to achieve.
This requires a lot of case analysis, can be 10, 11, 12, 13 or so... In top view, (1,1), (1,3) location implies at least two blocks in row 1. Side view requirement (2,1,2,3,2) seems important.

Consider two sets for the side view, assume they correspond to columns and rows respectively.

If top view has 7, but row and column height requires >=12 blocks to satisfy profile of numbers 2,1,2,3,2.
Can use trial and error, since cannot analyze by hand calculation, but we will try (B), since (A) is too small and can be easily eliminated.

Answer: B)
