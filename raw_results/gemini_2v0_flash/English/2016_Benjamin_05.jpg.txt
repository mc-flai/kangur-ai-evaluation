Reasoning: The original square has side length 10 cm, so its area is 10 cm * 10 cm = 100 cm². The smaller square is formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the larger square. This smaller square is tilted. The area of the smaller square is exactly half the area of the larger square. The area of the smaller square = 100/2 = 50 cm².
Another way to solve this is to consider the smaller square to be composed of four triangles, each with a base and height of 5 cm. The area of each triangle is 0.5 * 5 * 5 = 12.5 cm^2. The area of the smaller square is 4 * 12.5 = 50 cm^2.
