Reasoning: First, find the total number of children registered: 13 + 19 = 32 children. We want to divide the children into 6 equally sized teams. To do this, we need the number of children to be divisible by 6. The next multiple of 6 that is greater than 32 is 36 (6 x 6 = 36). Therefore, we need 36 - 32 = 4 more children.
