Reasoning: Let the numbers in the 3x3 table be represented as follows:
a b c
d e f
g h i
We are given a=2, c=4, i=3 and we need to find g.
The condition states that the sum of four numbers in each 2x2 area is the same. Therefore,
a+b+d+e = b+c+e+f = d+e+g+h = e+f+h+i
We are interested in finding 'g'.
Consider the 2x2 squares in the corners:
2+b+d+e = 4+b+e+f
2+d+b+e = 3+h+e+f
So, we have 2+d+b+e = sum, and we also have g+h+d+e=sum and we want g.
We also know that the sum of the top right 2x2 is equal to 4+b+e+f, and the bottom right is equal to f+e+3+h. Therefore 4+b+e+f = f+e+3+h, and hence 4+b=3+h. So h = 1+b.

We also know the sum of the top left 2x2 is equal to the bottom right 2x2.
2+b+d+e = 3+h+e+f, therefore 2+b+d = 3+h+f. And, h = 1+b, and 1+b=h. Therefore 2+b+d=3+1+b+f or d=2+f. Now g=2 because g+h+d+e = 2+b+d+e implies that g=2. Then h = sum-d-e =sum-e-f-2 =1+b and g=sum -h-d-e.  If we consider the fact that a,c, i and g are opposite corners it's worth testing 1 which makes sense as the corners would be 2, 4, 3, 1
The sums will be 2+b+d+e = 4+b+e+f = 1+d+h+e = 3+h+e+f.
If we try g=1, let's write a=2, c=4, i=3, g=1.
We need the sums of each 2x2 to be the same, say S.
2+b+d+e=S
4+b+e+f=S
1+d+h+e=S
3+h+e+f=S

2+b+d+e=4+b+e+f -> d-f=2
1+d+h+e=3+h+e+f -> d-f=2
So d = f+2
Then 2+b+f+2+e = 4+b+e+f, so b+f+2+e is const. 
1+f+2+h+e = 3+h+e+f.
2+4+b+d=4+b+e+f. But b+d - b+f is 2. 

Let's assume b=1. Then h=2. 
2+1+d+e=S
4+1+e+f=S
1+d+2+e=S
3+2+e+f=S

d+e = S-3
e+f = S-5
d+e=S-3
e+f=S-5
d-f=2
Therefore the answer is g=6.

Reasoning: Consider the top left 2x2 square. Its sum is 2 + (top middle) + (left middle) + (center).
Consider the bottom right 2x2 square. Its sum is (center) + (right middle) + (bottom middle) + 3.
Consider the top right 2x2 square. Its sum is 4 + (top middle) + (center) + (right middle).
Consider the bottom left 2x2 square. Its sum is (bottom left) + (left middle) + (center) + (bottom middle).
Since all these sums must be equal, we can deduce a relationship between the values in the corners.
Let x be the value in the bottom left corner. We want to find x.
Notice that in our first and fourth 2x2 squares, (left middle) and (bottom middle) cancel out with (left middle) and (bottom middle)
So 2 + center = x + center
=> x=5
So we have 2 + (top middle) + (left middle) + (center) = 3 + (bottom middle) + (right middle) + (center).
So 2+2+3+x=constant sum x will be 6.

The corners have to satisfy the below:
2 + bottom right cell number = 3 + top left cell number
so 2+3 = x+4

Consider the top left and bottom right 2x2 squares.
Then 2+b+d+e = 3+h+e+f. Also, consider the top right and bottom left 2x2.
4+b+e+f = x+d+h+e

Summing up all 2x2 boxes is equal. It could be seen 2+3=x+4. x = 6.
