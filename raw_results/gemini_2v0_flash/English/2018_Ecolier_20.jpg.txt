Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given equations:
1.  **Atom + Atom = Eye**  This means 2 * Atom = Eye. Since the possible values are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, Atom can be 1 or 2.
    - If Atom = 1, then Eye = 2
    - If Atom = 2, then Eye = 4
2.  **Sun + Sun = Atom** This means 2 * Sun = Atom.
    - Since Atom is either 1 or 2, and 2*Sun = Atom, this implies Atom = 2 and Sun = 1.
3.  **Sun + Fish = Wave** This means 1 + Fish = Wave. We know Eye = 4 now. Since we know Eye = 4, and Atom = 2 (from 2*Sun = Atom). Thus 2+2=4.
4. Knowing the Eye = 4 and Sun = 1,
If Sun =1 then 1 + Fish = Wave.
The remaining numbers are 3 and 5.
Then Fish = 3 and Wave =5 or reverse.
Let's check this with the first equation Atom + Atom = Eye then 2+2 = 4 which stands. Also in the last equation, if we assign fish = 3 then 1 + 3= 5 which means Wave = 5.
Finally, we have:
Sun = 1
Atom = 2
Fish = 3
Eye = 4
Wave = 5

The question is: Which symbol stands for the digit 3?  The answer is Fish.

Answer: E)
