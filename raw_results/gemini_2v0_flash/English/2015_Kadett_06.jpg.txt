Reasoning: The time it takes to drive from A to B via C is the sum of the time it takes to drive from A to C and the time it takes to drive from C to B.
Let $T(A \to B \text{ via } C)$ be the time it takes to drive from A to B via C.
Let $T(A \to C)$ be the time it takes to drive from A to C.
Let $T(C \to B)$ be the time it takes to drive from C to B.
We are given:
$T(A \to B \text{ via } C) = 130$ minutes.
$T(A \to C) = 35$ minutes.
We want to find $T(C \to B)$.
We have the equation:
$T(A \to B \text{ via } C) = T(A \to C) + T(C \to B)$
$130 = 35 + T(C \to B)$
$T(C \to B) = 130 - 35$
$T(C \to B) = 95$
