Reasoning:
Since N, U, M, B, E, and R each represent a different digit, and N × U × (M + B + E + R) = 33, we must find the factors of 33.
33 = 1 × 3 × 11. Thus, N and U must be 1, 3 or 3, 1 in some order, and (M + B + E + R) must equal 11.
So, N and U can be (1, 3) or (3, 1).
We need to find the number of combinations of distinct digits (0-9) whose sum is 11.
The smallest digits that can sum up to 11 are 0, 1, 2, and 8, but 1 and 3 are not possible since N and U are assigned those values, thus:
We need to select 4 distinct digits out of the remaining {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Combinations summing to 11:
0+2+9+0 is invalid because 0 is repeated
0 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 11
0 + 3 + x + x is invalid
0 + 4 + 7 + 0 invalid
0 + 5 + 6 + 0 is invalid
1 + 2 + 3 + x is invalid
1 + 3 + 4 + x is invalid
2 + 4 + 5 + 0 = 11
2 + 3 + 6 + 0 is invalid
2 + 8 + 0 + 1 Invalid

Possible sets of digits:
{0, 2, 4, 5}
{0, 2, 9, 0} invalid
{0, 3, 8, x} invalid
{0, 4, 7, 0} invalid
{0, 5, 6, 0} invalid
{2, 3, 6, 0} invalid
Since N and U are already taken, we can't use these digits again.
Consider 11 = M + B + E + R, with distinct digits. The possibilities are:
* 0 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 11
Permutations:
N = 1, U = 3. M, B, E, R can be any permutation of {0, 2, 4, 5}. Thus, 4! = 24 ways.
N = 3, U = 1. M, B, E, R can be any permutation of {0, 2, 4, 5}. Thus, 4! = 24 ways.
Total = 24 + 24 = 48 ways.
However, let's make sure we don't have other possible combinations that equal to 11, using the numbers that don't belong to 1 and 3
(0, 2, 4, 5), (0, 2, 9), (0, 3, 8), ...
Only combination possible is (0, 2, 4, 5)
Thus the number of permutations for (0,2,4,5) is 4! = 24
Since the combination (1, 3) and (3, 1) are permutations too, we multiply that by 2 to get 24*2 = 48

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
The prime factorization of 33 is 3 * 11 or 1 * 33 or 1 * 3 * 11. Since N and U are distinct digits, they must be 1 and 3 in some order. Thus, M + B + E + R = 11, where M, B, E, R are distinct digits and none of them can be 1 or 3. The only possible combination for M, B, E, R is {0, 2, 4, 5}. Thus, the letters N and U can be assigned in 2 ways (1, 3) or (3, 1). The letters M, B, E, R can be assigned in 4! = 24 ways. Thus, the total number of ways to replace the letters is 2 * 24 = 48.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
We are given that $N \times U \times (M+B+E+R) = 33$. Since each letter represents a distinct digit from 0 to 9, we must find the factors of 33. The factors of 33 are 1, 3, 11, and 33. Since $N$ and $U$ are distinct digits, we can say $N \times U$ must be equal to $1 \times 3 = 3$ since we need $(M+B+E+R)$ which must be an integer. Thus, we have $3 \times (M+B+E+R) = 33$.
Therefore, $(M+B+E+R) = 11$.
We now must find combinations of distinct digits that are not 1 and 3, which sum to 11.
The only combination of distinct digits that sum to 11, where none of them are 1 or 3, is 0 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 11. The digits are 0, 2, 4, 5.
N and U can be either (1,3) or (3,1). Thus there are 2 options for assigning these letters.
The letters M, B, E, R can be any permutation of the set {0, 2, 4, 5}. Thus there are $4!$ = 4*3*2*1 = 24 permutations of M, B, E, and R.
The total number of ways is $2 \times 24 = 48$.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
Since $N \times U \times (M+B+E+R) = 33$, we know that $N \times U$ must be a factor of 33. The factors of 33 are 1, 3, 11, 33. Since each letter is a different digit, $N$ and $U$ can be 1 and 3, or 3 and 1. Thus, $N \times U = 3$. This means $M+B+E+R = 11$. We need to find distinct digits that add up to 11, excluding 1 and 3. These digits must be distinct and range from 0 to 9.
Possible combinations are:
$0+2+4+5 = 11$

So M, B, E, and R can be any permutation of {0, 2, 4, 5}.
Since there are 4 digits, there are 4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24 possible permutations.
Also, N and U can be arranged in 2 ways (1,3) or (3,1).
So the total number of different ways is 24 x 2 = 48.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
Given $N \times U \times (M+B+E+R) = 33$, where $N, U, M, B, E, R$ are distinct digits from 0 to 9. The factors of 33 are 1, 3, 11, and 33. Since each letter is a unique digit, $N \times U = 1 \times 3 = 3$.
The order of N and U matters, so we have two options (1,3) or (3,1)
Then we have $M+B+E+R = 11$, and the digits $M, B, E, R$ must be distinct and cannot be 1 or 3.
We need to find a combination of 4 unique digits excluding 1 and 3 that sums to 11. One possible solution is $0+2+4+5 = 11$.
So, we can have {0, 2, 4, 5} as values for M, B, E, R. The number of permutations of these values is $4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24$.
Since N and U can be either {1,3} or {3,1}, we multiply by 2, so $24 \times 2 = 48$.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
We are given that $N \times U \times (M + B + E + R) = 33$. Since each letter represents a different digit (0, 1, 2, ..., 9), we must find the factors of 33. 33 = 1 x 3 x 11. So, N and U must be 1 and 3 in some order. This implies that $M + B + E + R = 11$.
We must select four distinct digits that are not 1 or 3, which sum to 11.

The only digits available are {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
The combination 0 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 11 works.

N and U can be either (1, 3) or (3, 1), which gives us 2 choices.
Then we must permute the set {0, 2, 4, 5} to assign M, B, E, and R. There are 4! = 24 permutations.
The total number of possible permutations is $2 \times 24 = 48$.
