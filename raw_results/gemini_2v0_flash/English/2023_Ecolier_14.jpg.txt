Reasoning: Let B represent a beaver and K a kangaroo. We have 6 beavers and 2 kangaroos in positions 1 to 8. The constraint is that in any three consecutive animals, there is exactly one kangaroo.
Let's consider the possible kangaroo positions.
If the kangaroos are in positions 1 and 4, we have KBBKBBBB, and looking at positions 5,6,7, there are no kangaroos, which is not allowed.
If the kangaroos are in positions 1 and 5, we have KBBKBXXX where X is B. But BKB means that positions 1,2,3 have exactly one kangaroo, positions 2,3,4 have 0 kangaroos. This is invalid.
Let's try K in position 2. We must have BKB. Now positions 4,5,6 must have exactly one K. BB could continue as BKB, so BKB BKB BB. The length is 8, 2 Ks and 6Bs, so this is an example of the configuration. So K is at position 2 is a possibility.
If K is at position 3, we have BBK. Now consider positions 4,5,6, we need 1 K. So BBK BKB. So BBK BKB BB. So K can be at position 3 as in BBK BKB BB.
If K is at position 4, we have BBBK. Now consider positions 5,6,7. We need one K, so BBBK BKB B, doesn't work.
If K is at position 5, we have BBBBKB. So we can have BBBK BKB B. But this doesn't work with position 1,2,3. But if we have BBKBKBXB. This doesn't fulfill the condition.

Let us check the options:
A) 1: KBBKBBBB. Considering positions 5,6,7, no K. Invalid.
B) 2: BKB BKB BB. Possible.
C) 3: BBK BKB BB. Possible.
D) 4: BBBK. We can complete this. BBBKBKB B. Positions 1,2,3: 0 Ks. Invalid.
E) 5: BBBBKBXB. This is incorrect.

The problem states "On which of THESE numbers". We seek the ONLY possible position.
Suppose K at 2. Then BKB. Consider BKB BKB BB. Then K at 2 and 5.
Suppose K at 3. Then BBK. Consider BBK BKB BB. Then K at 3 and 6.

Now, let us analyze the condition for three animals. Positions 1 to 8 are a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7,a8. Number of kangaroos=2. Then:
- positions 1,2,3 -> 1 K
- positions 2,3,4 -> 1 K
- positions 3,4,5 -> 1 K
- positions 4,5,6 -> 1 K
- positions 5,6,7 -> 1 K
- positions 6,7,8 -> 1 K

Then we seek K's.
Suppose 2 is a K. BKB. Then 5 is also a K. Then BKB BKB BB. Then the positions are 2 and 5.
Suppose 3 is a K. BBK. Then 6 is also a K. BBK BKB BB. Then the positions are 3 and 6.
Comparing the options: we have 2, 3. So 2 is possible or 3 is possible. Only one position must be correct! Let me double check my configuration. The correct answer has to be among these!

If K at position 2: BKB BKB BB. So K at 2 and 5. This is possible
If K at position 3: BBK BKB BB. So K at 3 and 6. This is possible.

If K is at positions 3 and 6, 3-4-5 -> BKB.
Consider positions 1,2,3: If a1=K, KBKBKB. Not allowed.
Positions 1,2,3 -> BBK - we must have the kangaroos at positions 3 and x. x = {6}. Positions 3 and 6 are a possibility.

Now from the given options determine the numbers:
Positions 2,5 -> only B is possible
Positions 3,6 -> only C is possible
So it is only possible on one of these numbers

Suppose we analyze the possibilities in another order:
We want the positions for these Kangaroos {a,b} where "a" and "b" are the location values for the kangaroos. Thus, with a<=8 and b<=8. Also given 6 beavers and 2 kangaroos. Let a = 2 then the first 3 elements are:
1 K position a: * * K where each star element is a B element for beaver.

Looking at the problem carefully the question is "On which of THESE numbers stands a kangaroo?" and not "Which of THESE numbers" as in which is NOT a kangaroo position, since if we follow with any one number, there seems to exist other kangaroos positions as well. So lets consider K in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} each time.
A- K in 1: KB- then the third element has to be a beaver, 4 elements now we have the condition KBB *, *BB* -> so fifth element is a K or else with *BB elements
K at location 5 : 5 6 7 : at positions = B B B; -> thus cannot be since exactly 1K, for ANY 3 animals.

Now with two kangaroos there will then result in exactly 6 beavers as well,
If K locations=2, 5 : total locations = 2 -> {1, ...,  6} -> then exactly 3 places to place it (as per condition.  => NOT applicable.

Reasoning: Analyzing different valid scenarios and constraints, positions 2, 3 are the most suitable, as K at these positions does fit scenario for 3-length of the K at least once. Given options B, and C. I consider B being more plausible
Answer: B)
Reasoning: Given the condition that "of three animals in a row there is always exactly one kangaroo," and after considering possible arrangements of beavers (B) and kangaroos (K), the most plausible arrangement places a kangaroo at position 2. This arrangement ensures that any sequence of three consecutive animals contains exactly one kangaroo.
Answer: B)
Reasoning: Let's test the possibilities provided. If a kangaroo is at position 1, we have KBBKBBBB. This fails since positions 5, 6, and 7 have no kangaroos. If a kangaroo is at position 2, we have BKB BKB BB. This satisfies the condition. If a kangaroo is at position 3, we have BBK BKB BB. This satisfies the condition. If a kangaroo is at position 4, we have BBBK. This immediately leads to a problem as the first three positions have no kangaroo. If a kangaroo is at position 5, we have BBBKB. However, positions 1,2,3 could have a kangaroo at position 2: but as discussed, it depends and we do NOT know all the locations for our animals!!
Given only positions 2 or 3 works here. With a closer review, given each possible scenario, if one kangaroo at position 2, it also means another kangaroo at position 5, similarly for position 3 also. so the key here is: what positions CANNOT or "On which of THESE NUMBERS STANDS a kangaroo". Therefore if position is a K at 2 or 3 -> the position is said to exist. Therefore any animal on location 2 = always stands as kangaroo in specific formation sequence.
Answer: B)
Reasoning: We are looking for a position where a kangaroo *can* be. If we try position 2, we get BKB. Then, we can continue with BKB BKB BB, which fits the rule. Therefore, position 2 can have a kangaroo. If we try position 3, we get BBK, then BBK BKB BB, which works.

The question asks "On which of THESE numbers stands a kangaroo?" Let's analyze. Option A means the sequence starts with a kangaroo. Option B means the sequence's second entry is a kangaroo. And so on. Option B will satisfy the condition that a kangaroo STANDS on location #2.

Positions 1, 2, and 3 must have exactly one kangaroo. Then either position 1 is K, or 2 is K, or 3 is K. 4 and 5 and 6 must have a kangaroo! And so on
Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Given 6 beavers and 2 kangaroos. In any group of 3, there is exactly one kangaroo.
Let's represent beaver as B and kangaroo as K.
A) If 1 is a kangaroo: KBBKBBBB. 5,6,7 => BBB - invalid
B) If 2 is a kangaroo: BKB BKB BB. 2,5 are kangaroos.
C) If 3 is a kangaroo: BBK BKB BB. 3,6 are kangaroos.
D) If 4 is a kangaroo: BBBK. Now the three consecutive integers have to contain 1 kangaroo always. In this case, 1,2,3 positions will not have a kangaroo! - invalid
E) If 5 is a kangaroo:

Looking at what question is asking "On which of THESE numbers stands a kangaroo?" means that the kangaroo *CAN* be located at these location.
As such the first three must have exactly one kangaroo in each triplet. So the kangaroo number must be at position 2 or 3, so there is only one kangaroo amongst it.
Position #2 has been shown.

Answer: B)
Reasoning: Given that "of three animals in a row there is always exactly one kangaroo", if we place a kangaroo at position 2 (option B), we can construct a valid sequence like "BKB BKB BB." However, if we place a kangaroo at position 4, then we have BBBK and then no kangaroo at positions 1 2 and 3. This violates the question, so 4 cannot be selected. We need to confirm that is 2 *CAN* be assigned and since is there a valid solution available given is: "BKB BKB BB"
Answer: B)
