Reasoning:
We need to check which of the given passwords satisfy both conditions:
1. The last three characters are digits.
2. There are at most three capital letters.

(A) PAUL123: Last three are digits. Capital letters: PAUL (4). Fails condition 2.
(B) POa1u2L3: Last three are digits. Capital letters: PO, L (3). Satisfies both conditions.
(C) 1234LLuuaapp4321: Last three are digits. Capital letters: LL (2). Satisfies both conditions.
(D) Paulin3: Last three are NOT digits. Fails condition 1.
(E) 123PAUL: Last three are NOT digits. Fails condition 1.

Since both B and C satisfy the conditions but, option C has more than 3 digits so it is more likely to be the answer.

Answer: C)

(D) Paulin3: Last three are NOT digits. Fails condition 1.
(E) 123PAUL: Last three are NOT digits. Fails condition 1.

Both B and C satisfy both conditions. Since there can be only one correct answer, let's re-evaluate.

The problem says "at most three capital letters", which means 0, 1, 2, or 3 capital letters.

(B) POa1u2L3: Three capital letters
(C) 1234LLuuaapp4321: Two capital letters.

The question asks "Which of the following passwords *could* be Paul's?" meaning we want the one that fits all the specified conditions.
Both B and C work.
However, since option B has 3 capital letters and option C has 2, both satisfy the "at most three capital letters" condition.

We need to look for something that breaks the tie. Maybe the prompt intends "at least" three capital letters.

The last three characters are digits is clear.

If the prompt intended at least three capital letters, no answers would work.
So assume that the question is intended to be "at most three capital letters and the last three are digits"
Then the answers that work are B and C.
The question becomes which answer is *more correct*.
Since the instructions do not indicate a typo it must be that B is what it is so that is my final answer

Answer: B)
