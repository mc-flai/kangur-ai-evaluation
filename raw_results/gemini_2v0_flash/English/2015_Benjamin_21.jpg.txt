Reasoning:
We are given a paper net of 7 squares and we need to remove one square so that the remaining 6 squares form a valid cube net. We must keep in mind that the remaining 6 squares must be connected. We consider each of the options below.

If we remove square 3: We get the net 1,2,4,5,6,7.
If we remove square 4: We get the net 1,2,3,5,6,7.
If we remove square 7: We get the net 1,2,3,4,5,6.

We know that a valid net for a cube is four squares in a row and one square attached on the top side and one on the bottom side of the chain.

Removing 3 yields: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7. In this configuration, we can consider the four connected squares 4,5,6,7. Now, 1 is above the first and 2 is also above the first, thus it cannot form a net.

Removing 4 yields: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7. Here we can consider 2,1,5,6 in chain, 3 at the top and 7 at the bottom. Thus this configuration can form a cube net.

Removing 7 yields: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Consider 4,5,6,3 in chain, 1 and 2 on the top, this cannot be fold into a cube.
Also the cube net 1,2,3,6,5,4 also can be made.

Therefore removing 3 or 4 results in a valid cube net formation.

Reasoning:
We need to find which square, when removed from the given 7-square net, leaves a 6-square net that can form a cube. We test each of the answer choices.
A) If we remove only 4, we have squares 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 left. This can form a cube.
B) If we remove only 7, we have squares 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 left. This can also form a cube.
C) If we remove only 3 or 4, if we remove 3, the result is 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7. We can consider 4,5,6,7 in chain, 1 and 2 can not be in top side only.
D) If we remove 3 or 7. If we remove 3, the result is 1,2,4,5,6,7. Not possible.
E) The only squares that can be removed such that the remaining 6 form a valid cube are 3 and 7.

If we remove 3, the net is 1,2,4,5,6,7. Squares 4,5,6,7 are in a row. However 1 and 2 are both connected with square 4 which is the same side. So removing 3 doesn't form a valid net.

If we remove 4, the net is 1,2,3,5,6,7. This can form a valid cube net. Let 5,6,7 be in a row, then square 3 is below 7, square 1 is above 5, square 2 is beside square 1, and square 2 is above 6. It forms a cube.

If we remove 7, the net is 1,2,3,4,5,6. This can also form a valid cube net. Let 4,5,6 be in a row, square 1 is above square 4, square 2 is adjacent to square 1 and also above 5, and square 3 is adjacent to square 2 and also above 6. It forms a valid cube.

Therefore we can form a valid cube by removing either 3 or 7.

Final Answer: (D)
Reasoning:
We need to find which square can be removed from the net such that the remaining 6 squares remain connected and can form a cube. We can visualize folding the net to determine which squares can be removed.
If we remove square 3: The remaining squares are 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7. This cannot form a cube because squares 1 and 2 would overlap when folded.
If we remove square 4: The remaining squares are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7. This can form a cube.
If we remove square 7: The remaining squares are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. This can form a cube.
If we test only 3 or 7, we found that only 7 work.

Let consider the chain 4,5,6,7. 1 and 2 are connected on the same top row of the chain. so not a cube. if we take 1,2,3,5,6,7. then the chain is 5,6,7. then 4,1,2,3 connected in a same row, then 5 and 3 are on different side. then cannot be made.

Final Answer: (D)
Reasoning:
We need to identify which single square can be removed from the 7-square net such that the remaining 6 squares form a valid net for a cube and remain connected.
We can remove the square number 3 or 7. Removing 3 allows the net to fold properly, as does removing 7. Thus, squares 3 or 7 can be removed to obtain a cube.
Final Answer: (D)
Reasoning:
A cube net must have 6 connected squares. We are given a figure with 7 connected squares. Thus, we must remove one square such that the remaining 6 form a valid cube net.

If we remove 3, we are left with 1,2,4,5,6,7. This is not a valid net. 1,2 connected to 4. 4,5,6,7 chain. then not a valid cube
If we remove 4, we are left with 1,2,3,5,6,7. This IS a valid net! 567 chain 3 below 7, and 12 above. 
If we remove 7, we are left with 1,2,3,4,5,6. This IS a valid net! 4,5,6 chain. then 1,2,3 above.

Final Answer: (D)
Reasoning:
The question asks which squares can be removed to form a cube. We must test which ones, when removed, still allow the formation of a cube.
- Removing 3 leaves: 1,2,4,5,6,7. Not a cube
- Removing 4 leaves: 1,2,3,5,6,7.  This CAN form a cube.
- Removing 7 leaves: 1,2,3,4,5,6. This CAN form a cube.

Final Answer: (D)
