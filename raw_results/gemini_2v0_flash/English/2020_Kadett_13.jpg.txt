Reasoning: The piece on the right consists of a triangular prism sitting on top of a larger triangular prism. From above, you would see the top of the smaller prism (gray triangle), surrounded by the walls of the larger prism (represented by the black lines) and then the edges of the larger prism (represented by the blue outlines). The top of the smaller triangular prism is dark grey, while the larger prism is light grey. This shape is represented by figure C.
