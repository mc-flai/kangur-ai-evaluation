Reasoning:
Let the total area of the shape be 100%.
The grey area is 45% of the total area.
The white part of the triangle is 40% of the total area.
Therefore, the area of the circle plus the area of the triangle is the total area minus the overlapping area.
The area of the circle and triangle together would be:
Total Area = Area of Triangle(white) + Area of Overlap(grey) + Area of Circle(white outside of the triangle).
100% = 40% + 45% + Area of Circle(white outside of the triangle)
100% - 40% - 45% = Area of Circle(white outside of the triangle)
15% = Area of Circle(white outside of the triangle).

To figure out the percent of area of the circle outside the triangle:
We know that
Area of Circle = Area of grey area + Area of circle outside of the triangle
Area of Circle = 45% + 15% = 60%
Now the percent of the area of the circle outside the triangle is = (15%/60%)*100% = 25%.
