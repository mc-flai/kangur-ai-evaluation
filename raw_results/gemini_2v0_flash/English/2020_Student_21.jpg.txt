Reasoning:
The equations of the lines are given by y = ax + b and y = cx + d. From the graph, we can infer the following:
1. Line r is horizontal, meaning its slope is 0. Therefore, a = 0.
2. Line r intersects the y-axis at a positive value. Therefore, b > 0.
3. Line s has a positive slope. Therefore, c > 0.
4. Line s intersects the y-axis at a negative value. Therefore, d < 0.
Now let's analyze the given options:
A) ab + cd < 0. Since a = 0, ab = 0. So, we have 0 + cd < 0, which means cd < 0. Since c > 0 and d < 0, cd < 0 is true.
B) a + b + c + d < 0. Since a = 0, we have b + c + d < 0. b > 0, c > 0, and d < 0. It is not necessarily true that b + c + d < 0.
C) ac + bd ≥ 0. Since a = 0, ac = 0. So, we have 0 + bd ≥ 0, which means bd ≥ 0. Since b > 0 and d < 0, bd < 0. Therefore, bd ≥ 0 is false.
D) a + b + c + d > 0. Since a = 0, we have b + c + d > 0. b > 0, c > 0, and d < 0. It is not necessarily true that b + c + d > 0.
E) abcd > 0. Since a = 0, abcd = 0. Therefore, abcd > 0 is false.

Reasoning: Based on the analysis above, only option A) is true.

Answer: A)
