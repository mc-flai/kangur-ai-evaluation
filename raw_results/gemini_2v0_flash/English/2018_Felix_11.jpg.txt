Reasoning: First, we need to find out how many spots are on each mushroom. By looking at the image, we can see that each mushroom has 4 spots on one side. Since the other side has the same amount of spots, each mushroom can shelter 4 + 4 = 8 dwarfs. There are 4 mushrooms in total, so they can shelter 4 * 8 = 32 dwarfs. Since there are 36 dwarfs trying to hide, and only 32 can fit under the mushrooms, 36 - 32 = 4 dwarfs will get wet.
