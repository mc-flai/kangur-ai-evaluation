Reasoning:
The number of tiles in the number wall is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21. We want to find the maximum number of odd numbers we can write on the tiles.
Since we want to maximize the number of odd numbers, we should start from the bottom row and fill it with odd numbers as much as possible.
Let's denote O as odd and E as even.
- O + O = E
- O + E = O
- E + E = E
We can fill the bottom row with alternating O and E. For example, O E O E O E. Then the next row becomes E O E O E, then E E O E E, then E E E E, then E E E and then E E and then finally E at the top.

However, we can do better than that.
Let's consider filling the bottom row with only odd numbers: O O O O O O. The next row becomes E E E E E, then E E E E, then E E E, then E E and finally E. The number of odd numbers is 6.

Consider O E O E O E. Then the next row is O O O O O, followed by E E E E, followed by E E E, followed by E E and finally E. Total number of odd numbers is 6 + 5 = 11.

If we set all the numbers in the bottom row to be odd, then we can arrange to get more odd numbers. If the bottom row is alternating odd and even, O E O E O E, then the row above is the sum of the two below, giving O O O O O. This continues in a pattern.

Let's try setting the first value to be odd. Then we can set it to 1. The other values are also 1.
Then the rows are 1 1 1 1 1 1, then 2 2 2 2 2, then 4 4 4 4, then 8 8 8, then 16 16, and then finally 32. There is only 6 odds.
We need to arrange O and E to maximize O.

Consider starting with all odd numbers in the bottom row.
Then we get O O O O O O
     E E E E E
       E E E E
         E E E
           E E
             E
Total = 6 odd numbers.

Consider starting with alternating odd and even numbers in the bottom row.
Then we get O E O E O E
       O O O O O
         E E E E
           E E E
             E E
               E
Total = 6 + 5 = 11 odd numbers.
Now let's explore more alternating options.
Let's look at the case with 5 odd numbers in the bottom row and 1 even number.
O O O O O E
E E E E O
E E E O
E E O
E O
O

Then we have 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9. 5 + 1 + 1 +1 + 1 = 9 odd numbers
Let's say we have 4 Odd numbers
O O O O E E
E E E O E
E E O O
E O E
O O
E

Then we have 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 8
O O E O O E
E O O O O
O O O O
E O O
O O
E
5 + 1 + 3 = 9
O O O O E O
E E E O O
E E O O
E O O
O O
E
5 + 1 + 3 = 9

It seems it is related to Pascals triangle. Count 1s
If we write the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ... then the terms are 1, 1+2, 1+2+3.
(1+x)^5
1 + 5x + 10 x^2 + 10 x^3 + 5 x^4 + 1 x^5

If we arrange the bottom row to be O E O E O E, then we get 1 + (1+x) + (1+x)^2 + ...+ (1+x)^5

Since the triangle has 21 positions, 11 odd numbers, then 10 even numbers
O = 15 E = 6
We need to calculate how many odds in the Pascals triangle. The bottom row has 6 elements. 1 5 10 10 5 1. The total number of odd coefficients is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

The bottom level is n = 5. Number of levels k = 6.
64 divided by 2 to the 6 -> 1 level.

The number of odds is 16 when there are 5 levels and 17 when there are 6 levels. The answer should be 16.

Reasoning:
After some trials and errors, I tried to maximize the number of odd numbers by filling the bottom row mostly with odd numbers. Since it is related to Pascal's triangle, I realize that starting with all odd numbers and then going up, means that most numbers at the higher levels will be even. Also, if the bottom row alternates odd-even, the number of odd numbers goes down the pyramid.
There are 21 tiles total. By experimentation, the maximum is 16.
