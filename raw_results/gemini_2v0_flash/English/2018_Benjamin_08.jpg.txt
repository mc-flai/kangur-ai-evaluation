The image provided only includes the problem statement and answer options. There is no visual representation of the figure made up of three squares. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the side length of the biggest square with the current information. The image showing "2 cm" appears unrelated to the question. Thus, I cannot answer this question.

Reasoning: There is not enough visual information to figure out the answer to this problem.

Answer: Cannot answer
