Reasoning:
We need to find the minimum number of power plants needed to supply electricity to all 16 towns. A power plant can supply electricity to itself and its immediate neighbors.
Let's analyze the graph. We can build a power plant in the center of the graph and it will supply power to at most 5 towns: the town with the power plant, plus 4 direct neighbors. A power plant at the edge supplies to at most 3 towns. If we try to minimize the number of power plants needed, we can see the following:
Start by placing plants such that most of the network gets covered.

By carefully placing 4 power plants in the appropriate locations, we can cover all 16 towns:
- Plant 1: Top-left
- Plant 2: Bottom-left
- Plant 3: Top-right
- Plant 4: Bottom-right

This solution might not be optimal. By placing power plants more judiciously, we might be able to cover the map with fewer than 4 power plants.
However, placing 3 power plants isn't enough to cover all 16 towns because that would mean each power plant needs to cover more than 5 towns.

If we carefully place 4 power plants, we can cover all the towns as described above, with a total of 16 towns covered.
If we try to cover the map with 3 power plants, it doesn't work out, as 16/3 > 5.

Therefore, the minimum number of power plants is 4.
