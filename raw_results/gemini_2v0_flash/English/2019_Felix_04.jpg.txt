Reasoning: There are 12 children in total. Susi is 7th from the front. Kim is 2nd from the back. That means there are 12 - 2 = 10 children in front of Kim.
Since Susi is 7th from the front, and Kim has 10 children in front of her, Kim is ahead of Susi.
The positions are:
1 2 3 4 5 6 Susi 8 9 10 Kim 12
Children in front of Susi = 6
Children behind Susi = 12-7 = 5
Children behind Kim = 1
Children in front of Kim = 10
The number of children between Susi and Kim is:
(Number of children in front of Kim) - (Number of children in front of Susi) - 1 = 10 - 6 - 1 = 3

Answer: B)
