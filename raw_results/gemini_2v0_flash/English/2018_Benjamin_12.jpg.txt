Reasoning:
Let's denote the numbers behind the smudges as A, B, C and the number behind the star as X. The given equations are:
A + X - B = 8
C * B = 8
The numbers A, B, C, and X are from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and are distinct.
From C * B = 8, we can deduce the only integer pair for C and B from the available digits is 4 and 2. So either C=4 and B=2 or C=2 and B=4.

Case 1: C=4, B=2.
A + X - 2 = 8 => A + X = 10.
Since A and X can only be 1, 3, or 5 and distinct, the only possible pair is A=5, X=5, but these must be distinct. Not a solution.

Case 2: C=2, B=4.
A + X - 4 = 8 => A + X = 12.
Since A and X can only be 1, 3, or 5 and distinct, the only possible pair is A=5, X=7 or A=7, X=5 or A=3, X=9 or A=9, X=3 which are not from the available digits.
However, since the numbers must be from {1,2,3,4,5} the values can only be 1, 3 or 5.
If X = 5, A = 7, but 7 is not available.
If X = 3, A = 9, not available.
If X = 1, A = 11, not available.

Let's try rearranging the first equation: A + X = 8 + B
If B=2, then A + X = 10. Remaining digits {1, 3, 4, 5}. A and X must be 5,5 - not valid since they must be distinct.
If B=4, then A + X = 12. Remaining digits {1, 2, 3, 5}. A and X must sum to 12 - not valid since the max is 8 (3+5).

It looks like I might be misunderstanding how the equation is being read. It could be that we aren't actually solving two separate equations.
Let's consider various values for X (the star) from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}:
A + X is on the upper arrow. Then that goes - B.
C * B is on the bottom arrow, divided by the previous answer to give 8.
(A + X - B) / (C * B) = 8

Let's consider the various X values. Also the fact that {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} get used exactly once.
If X = 1, then {2, 3, 4, 5} remaining.
If X = 2, then {1, 3, 4, 5} remaining.
If X = 3, then {1, 2, 4, 5} remaining.
If X = 4, then {1, 2, 3, 5} remaining.
If X = 5, then {1, 2, 3, 4} remaining.

Let's try this as (A + X) - B = 8 * (C * B).
If X=3, {1, 2, 4, 5} remaining. A + 3 - B = 8CB. If B = 1, A-1 = 8C. If C = 1, not valid because used already.
We are missing a division.
(A+X-B)/(CxB) = 8
Try X = 5.
Then we have {1,2,3,4}. Possible pairs of C and B giving us small number as an option: C=1, B=2, and C=2, B=1, C=1, B=4, C=4, B=1, C=2, B=3 etc..  
When C=1, B=2: (A+5-2)/(2*1) = 8
A+3 = 16 --> A=13. Invalid A since A<6.

The equation must be:  (A+X) - (B/(C*B)) = 8
(A+X) = 8 + (B/(C*B))
(A+X) = 8 + (1/C)
Since A+X must be integer, 1/C must be an integer. so, C must be 1.
Then (A+X) = 9. {2,3,4,5} are left. A and X are unique values selected from this. Pairs are (4,5) and (5,4) etc. if
If X is 4, A is 5. So, we have {1,2,3}. B is now limited to either 2 or 3.

Then C*B must either have C=1, B=2 or 3.
X = 4, means {1, 2, 3, 5}
Try X = 4. Then A must be 5.  
(A+4)= 9.
1 + 4 = 5. C = 1, B=3, not possible.

Final Answer:
Reasoning: The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are each used once. The star hides one of these numbers. The two calculations using the two arrows are correct.
Let the star be 'X'.
We are given: (A + X - B) / (C / B) = 8.
Then (A+X-B) = 8*(C/B) or (A+X-B)=8CB where one of them is a division.
If it is (A + X - B) / (C * B) = 8 then, A+X-B=8CB. Since values are small, the equation is likely:
(A+X) / (B- C*B) =8. I am not 100 percent sure about the relationships provided.
