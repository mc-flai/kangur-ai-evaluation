Reasoning: The question asks which section Peter *cannot* see with a magnifying glass. The image shows a tangled drawing. With a magnifying glass, he can see the detail within a small area, but cannot simultaneously see the overall structure. Therefore, the magnifying glass is not going to allow him to see multiple crossing lines. Only the answer in choice (C) shows more than two lines crossing in a small area and therefore a view Peter could not see through the magnifying glass.
Answer: C)
