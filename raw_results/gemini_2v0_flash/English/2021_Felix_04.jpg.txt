Reasoning: To punch a hole through all four layers of paper, the hole must be punched at a point where all four layers overlap. Looking at the arrangement of the papers, only points C, D, and E are covered by all four layers. Thus, either C, D, or E should be the answer. Since C, D, and E are options to pick. Let see if the hole will pass through all the papers with options C, D, or E. As the shape represents 4 identical shapes, only C, D, or E will pass through.
Answer: C)
