Reasoning:
The problem states that Julia has 1009 black discs and 1008 white discs. She wants to make the biggest square possible, alternating the colors. Let $n$ be the side length of the square.
The total number of discs needed is $n^2$. Since the total number of discs available is $1009+1008=2017$, we want to find the largest $n$ such that $n^2 \le 2017$.
Since $44^2 = 1936$ and $45^2 = 2025$, the largest square she can make has side length 44.
So she uses $44^2 = 1936$ discs. The number of discs left is $2017-1936 = 81$.
Now we need to determine how many of each color were used.
Since the square has side length 44, it has an even side length. Thus, the number of black and white discs used are equal.
$1936 / 2 = 968$.
So she used 968 black discs and 968 white discs.
The number of black discs remaining is $1009 - 968 = 41$.
The number of white discs remaining is $1008 - 968 = 40$.
Therefore, there are 41 black discs and 40 white discs left.
