Reasoning:
Let the numbers in the horizontal row be $a$, $x$, $b$ from left to right, where $x$ is the number in the middle square.
Let the numbers in the vertical column be $c$, $x$, $d$ from top to bottom.
We are given that the sum of the three numbers in the horizontal row is the same as the sum of the three numbers in the vertical column.
Therefore, $a+x+b = c+x+d$, which means $a+b = c+d$.
The numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9. The sum of the numbers is $1+2+3+4+9 = 19$.
We want to find the value of $x$.
Since $a+b = c+d$, we have $a+b+c+d = 19-x$.
Then $2(a+b) = 19-x$, so $19-x$ must be an even number.
For $19-x$ to be even, $x$ must be odd. The possible values for $x$ are 1, 3, and 9.

If $x=1$, $19-1=18$, so $a+b = c+d = 9$. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, 4, 9. We need to find two numbers that add up to 9. The possible pairs are (2,x), (3,x), (4,x), (9,x). We can make $2+x=9$ or $3+x=9$ or $4+x=9$. Since we can't repeat, the pairs can be (2,x), (3,x), (4,x), (9,x). Possible sums of 9 are $2+7$, $3+6$, $4+5$. Since we only have $2, 3, 4, 9$, there is no pair that adds to 9.
The only possibility is $2+3+4+9 = 18$. We seek $a+b = c+d = 9$. Can $a+b = 9$ using numbers from $\{2,3,4,9\}$? Yes: $9+0$ is not valid since 0 is not given; $3+4+2 =9$ is possible.
If we consider sums with 9, we can write $a+b = 9-1 = 8$, so $a+b = 1+2=3$. We can't use the number already taken.

If $x=3$, $19-3=16$, so $a+b = c+d = 8$. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 4, 9. We can find a pair summing to 8: 9+x, 1+2+4 +9.
If we have 1,2,4,9 we want $a+b=8$. There are no values from these which add up to 8. So $a+b= 9+4+1 =14$.
If we have pairs adding to 8, we have $9$ we want to get $8$ then $1,2,4,9$ is $1+2+4+9 =8 $

If $x=9$, $19-9=10$, so $a+b = c+d = 5$. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4. We can find pairs summing to 5: (1,4) and (2,3). Then, the horizontal row can be 1, 9, 4 and the vertical column can be 2, 9, 3. The sums are $1+9+4=14$ and $2+9+3=14$. So the sums are equal.

Answer: E).
Reasoning:
The number in the middle, $x$, appears in both the horizontal and vertical sums. Let the horizontal sum be $H$ and the vertical sum be $V$. We have $H = V$. Also, we can express the sum of all five numbers as $(H - x) + (V - x) + x = H + V - x = 2H - x$. Therefore $1+2+3+4+9 = 19 = 2H - x$, so $2H = 19+x$. Since $2H$ is even, $19+x$ must be even, meaning that $x$ is odd. The odd numbers in the list are 1, 3 and 9.
If $x=1$, we have 2, 3, 4, 9 to use. Then $2H = 19+1 = 20$, so $H=10$. We want two pairs of numbers summing to $10-1 = 9$. The pairs must come from {2, 3, 4, 9}. No combination can give a sum of 9.
If $x=3$, we have 1, 2, 4, 9 to use. Then $2H = 19+3 = 22$, so $H=11$. We want two pairs of numbers summing to $11-3 = 8$. The pairs must come from {1, 2, 4, 9}. No combination can give a sum of 8.
If $x=9$, we have 1, 2, 3, 4 to use. Then $2H = 19+9 = 28$, so $H=14$. We want two pairs of numbers summing to $14-9 = 5$. The pairs must come from {1, 2, 3, 4}. The pairs summing to 5 are {1, 4} and {2, 3}.
So, we can put 1, 9, 4 in the horizontal row, giving a sum of $1+9+4=14$. Then we can put 2, 9, 3 in the vertical column, giving a sum of $2+9+3=14$.

Answer: E)
Reasoning:
Let's consider the possible values for the number in the middle. Since the numbers must be distinct, let's represent the cross as follows:

  A
  |
C-X-B
  |
  D

Where A, B, C, D, and X are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9. We are given that the sum of the horizontal row and the vertical column are equal, so:

A + X + D = C + X + B, which means A + D = C + B.

Also, A + B + C + D + X = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 9 = 19.

Replacing A + D with C + B, we get C + B + C + B + X = 19, or 2(C + B) + X = 19. This means 2(C + B) = 19 - X. Since the left side of the equation is even, the right side must also be even, which implies that X is an odd number. Possible candidates for X are 1, 3, and 9.

If X = 1, then 2(C + B) = 19 - 1 = 18, so C + B = 9. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, 4, and 9. Since we need C + B = 9, possible sums of 9 can be (2,x), (3,x), (4,x), (9,x)

If X = 3, then 2(C + B) = 19 - 3 = 16, so C + B = 8. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 9. No combination sums to 8.

If X = 9, then 2(C + B) = 19 - 9 = 10, so C + B = 5. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4. We can use 1+4 = 5 and 2+3 = 5, so A+D = 5 also. We can fill the cross as follows:
   1
   |
 2-9-3
   |
   4

1+9+4 = 14
2+9+3 = 14
