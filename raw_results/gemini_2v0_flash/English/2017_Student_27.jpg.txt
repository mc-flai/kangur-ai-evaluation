Reasoning: Let the middle cell be $x$. Then the cells adjacent to the middle cell can be either $x-1$ or $x+1$. The corner cells can be $x-2, x-1, x, x+1, x+2$.

The sum of the numbers in the 3x3 table is 500. Let's represent the numbers in the cells relative to the number in the middle cell, $x$.

The minimum sum would be:
(x-2) + (x-1) + (x-2) + (x-1) + x + (x+1) + (x-2) + (x+1) + (x+2) + (x-1) + (x) + (x+1) + (x-2) + (x-1) + (x-1)
The cells around the middle cell would have values that are $x-1, x, x+1$.
The middle cell is x
The average of all the numbers in the 3x3 table is 500/9 = 55.55...
Since the numbers differ by 1, the distribution is symmetric. The numbers in the cells can be represented as:
x-1, x-1, x-1, x, x, x, x+1, x+1, x+1.
Let's represent the cells as:
x-1 x x+1
x x x
x-1 x x+1
Or something similar

Let $x$ be the value of the center square. We can represent all the other numbers in terms of $x$ and their distance from $x$. Each surrounding cell can only differ by 1.

Consider the following arrangement:
x-1 x x+1
x x x
x+1 x x-1

Consider the following:

$x-1, x, x+1$ are arranged around $x$.
The maximum deviation from the middle is 2.
Each corner is adjacent to two other cells with a distance of sqrt(2).
Top left is x-2, x-1, or x.
Top middle is x-1 or x+1 or x.
etc.

Let the middle number be x. Since each number in an adjacent cell differs by 1, each of the four adjacent cells will be either x-1 or x+1. The four corners will be x-2, x, x+2.
So the sum will be approximately 9x = 500
x = 500/9 = 55.555
x should be near 55 or 56

Let the middle number be 55. Then we have 55 in the middle. The numbers can be 53, 54, 55, 56, 57.

It turns out that the middle number is closest to the average, which is 55.555. Since the number is an integer, the nearest is 55.
If the middle number is x, then the sum of the numbers must be nearly 9x. Since 9x = 500, x = 500/9 = 55.555. Since we require integers, the middle number must be 55.

Answer: C)
Final Answer: C)
Reasoning: The sum of all numbers is 500, and there are 9 numbers. The average of the numbers is 500/9 ≈ 55.56. The middle number will be close to the average, since it is symmetrically surrounded by other numbers that are either 1 more or 1 less than its neighbors. Also the numbers must be integers. Hence 55 must be the correct answer.

Answer: C)
Final Answer: C)
Reasoning: Since adjacent cells differ by exactly 1, the value of each cell can be expressed as x + a, where x is the value of the center cell and a is an integer. The value of a depends on how far away the cell is from the center.

Each cell has value $x + a_i$ where $|a_i| \le 2$. Thus the sum of all the values is
$\sum (x+a_i) = 9x + \sum a_i = 500$. The average of all the cells is $500/9 \approx 55.5$. The values of $a_i$ are negative or positive, and they sum to 0. The middle value should be close to 55 or 56. Try 55 as the middle number: the middle value $x = 55$. Then $9*55 + \sum a_i = 500$. $495 + \sum a_i = 500$. Then $\sum a_i = 5$.

Consider an array where $x$ = value of the center
x-1, x, x+1, x-1, x, x+1, x-1, x, x+1
Or each cell is either $x-1, x, x+1$. Then if the total sum = 500, we expect the value to be near 55 or 56.
Answer must be C.
Final Answer: C)
Final Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let $x$ be the value in the middle cell. Since neighboring cells differ by 1, the values can be $x-1$ or $x+1$. The sum of the 9 values is 500. Thus the average value is $500/9 = 55.55$.

Since the values are symmetrically located, their values must be near 55 or 56. The answer is 55.

Final Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let $x$ be the value of the middle cell. Then neighboring values will be $x \pm 1$. Since the sum is 500 for 9 numbers, the average value is $500/9 \approx 55.56$. We expect the middle value to be nearest to the average. Thus it is 55.

Answer: C)
Final Answer: C)
Reasoning: The numbers in adjacent cells differ by 1.
Sum of the nine numbers is 500. Average number is 500/9 = 55.555...
The middle cell value should be closest to the average.
So, the answer is 55.

Answer: C)
Final Answer: C)
Reasoning: The average of the nine numbers is 500/9 which is approximately 55.56. Since the values in adjacent cells only differ by 1, the middle cell will be approximately the average of the values, or nearest to the average. 55 is the closest whole number.

Answer: C)

Final Answer: C)
Final Answer: C)
Reasoning: Since each adjacent cell differs by 1, the range of values will be symmetrically distributed around the central cell. Therefore, the average value of the 9 cells (500/9 ≈ 55.56) will be very close to the value of the central cell. The closest integer value is 55.

Answer: C)
Final Answer: C)
Reasoning: The average of the 9 numbers is 500/9 = 55.55... Since adjacent numbers differ by 1, we can expect the distribution to be symmetrical around the middle cell. Therefore the number in the middle cell is closest to the average which is 55.

Answer: C)
Final Answer: C)
Final Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let x be the number in the middle cell. Each adjacent cell will be x+1 or x-1. The numbers will be centered around x.
The average number is 500/9 = 55.55...
The average should be closest to the middle cell.

Answer: C)
Final Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let $x$ be the value in the middle cell. The values of the adjacent cells must be $x \pm 1$. Then the corner values would be $x\pm 2$. The average value is $500/9 = 55.55...$, implying the number in the middle cell to be nearest to the average. Thus middle cell value = 55

Answer: C)
Final Answer: C)
Reasoning: The sum of nine numbers in the cells of a 3x3 grid is 500. The average of these nine numbers is 500/9 = 55.555... Since each adjacent cell differs exactly by 1, the values will be symmetrical with respect to the middle cell. Thus, the value of the middle cell will be closest to the average.
Since all numbers are whole, value of middle cell is 55.

Answer: C)
Final Answer: C)
Reasoning: Since adjacent numbers differ by exactly 1, the values will be evenly distributed relative to the number in the middle cell, call it 'x'. So the average of all numbers (500/9 = 55.555...) will be very close to 'x'. The answer is 55, as all numbers are whole numbers.

Answer: C)
Final Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let 'm' be the number in the middle cell. Since adjacent numbers differ by 1, we can infer that numbers are somewhat equally distributed relative to the number in the middle. Therefore the average value will be close to m. Average = 500/9 = 55.555.. the nearest number is 55
