Reasoning:
First, let's analyze the given figure to determine the current ratio of white to black areas. We have:
- 3 fully white squares
- 3 fully black squares
- 2 squares that are half white and half black.
So the white area is 3 + 1 = 4 squares and the black area is 3 + 1 = 4 squares. Therefore, the areas are already the same size. This means that swapping the question mark with any other square will change the area of the figure.
However, the question wants to know which square you have to swap the question mark with to ensure the areas remain the same. The last square is currently white, which can be labeled as A.
- If we swap it with B (fully black), then we will have 3 white squares and 4 black squares, so total white area is 3 + 1 = 4 and total black area is 4 + 1 = 5. Areas are not the same.
- If we swap it with C (half white, half black), then total white area is 3.5 and total black area is 4.5. Areas are not the same.
- If we swap it with D (a downward triangle, so half white, half black), then total white area is 3.5 and total black area is 4.5. Areas are not the same.
- If we swap it with E (an upward triangle, so half white, half black), then total white area is 3.5 and total black area is 4.5. Areas are not the same.
Therefore, swapping the question mark with square A does not change the area of the figure.
Reasoning with areas not the same is not an option. Therefore, you can say A (fully white), B (fully black), C, D, or E (half and half). Currently, the white area and the black area are the same size, so a white box would work.
