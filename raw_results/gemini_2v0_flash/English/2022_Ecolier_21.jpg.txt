Reasoning:
Let the side of the square garden be $s$. Then, the perimeter of the square garden is $4s$.
Let the sides of the rectangular garden be $l$ and $w$. Then, the perimeter of the rectangular garden is $2(l+w)$.
In the given figure, the side of the square garden is $s=5$m, and the sides of the rectangular garden are $l=10$m and $w=5$m.
Perimeter of the square garden (Ahmed's path) = $4s = 4(5) = 20$m.
Perimeter of the rectangular garden (Sara's path) = $2(l+w) = 2(10+5) = 2(15) = 30$m.
Ahmed and Sara walk with the same speed. Let the speed be $v$.
Let $t$ be the time when they meet again at point A.
Distance covered by Ahmed = $v \cdot t = 20 \cdot n_A$, where $n_A$ is the number of rounds Ahmed completes.
Distance covered by Sara = $v \cdot t = 30 \cdot n_S$, where $n_S$ is the number of rounds Sara completes.
Since the speed is the same, we have $20 n_A = 30 n_S$, or $2 n_A = 3 n_S$.
We need to find the smallest integers $n_A$ and $n_S$ that satisfy this equation.
$n_A = 3$ and $n_S = 2$ is the smallest integer solution.
Therefore, Ahmed completes 3 rounds when they meet at point A again.
