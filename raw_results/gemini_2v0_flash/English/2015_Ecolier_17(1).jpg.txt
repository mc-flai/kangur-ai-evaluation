Reasoning: The image presents a shape composed of squares. The task is to determine how many triangles, identical to the one provided, are needed to fill the original shape. By carefully counting the triangles that fit within each section of the shape, we can get to a total. The large top left section contains 4 triangles. The top right section also has 4 triangles. The middle section can contain 2*2= 4 triangles. The bottom left section can contain 2 triangles and with the already present shaded region, 1 more triangle can fit inside. So, a grand total of 4+4+4+3= 15 triangles fit inside the original shape.
