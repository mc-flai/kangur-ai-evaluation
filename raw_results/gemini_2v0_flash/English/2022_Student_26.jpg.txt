Reasoning: The transformation (x, y) -> (1/x, 1/y) is applied to each point of the square.
The original square has corners at (1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 2).
Applying the transformation to these corners, we get:
(1, 1) -> (1, 1)
(2, 1) -> (1/2, 1)
(1, 2) -> (1, 1/2)
(2, 2) -> (1/2, 1/2)
The resulting shape will have corners at (1, 1), (1/2, 1), (1, 1/2), and (1/2, 1/2). Also, the straight sides of the original square will become curved. Therefore, option (E) is the correct one.

Answer: E)
