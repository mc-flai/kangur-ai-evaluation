Reasoning:
The three numbers are in the form: 1572_, _804, and 33_1. The sum of the three numbers is 57263.
The sum of the ones column is _ + 4 + 1 = ...3. This means that _ + 5 = ...3.
So, the missing digit must be 8.
With the 8, we have the numbers 15728, _804, and 33_1. Summing these, we have:
15728 + _804 + 33_1 = 57263

Let's focus on the tens column: 2 + 0 + _ = 6. This means that the missing digit is 4. So we have: 15728 + _804 + 3341 = 57263

Now we know the numbers are 15728, _804, and 3341. Let's focus on the thousands columns: 5 + _ + 3 = 7. This means that _ + 8 = 7, impossible.
Let's focus on the thousands columns: 5 + _ + 3 = 17. This means that _ + 8 = 17, so _ = 9. So we have: 15728 + 9804 + 3341 = 28873.

I made mistake to focus on 15728 + _804 + 33_1 = 57263 directly.
Let us add the numbers as shown in the image, where we have 1572x + y804 + 33z1 = 57263
Sum of the units: x + 4 + 1 = 3 or x + 4 + 1 = 13. Therefore x = 8 (since it can't be -2)
Sum of the tens: 2 + 0 + z = 6, so z = 4
Now 15728 + y804 + 3341 = 57263
15728 + 3341 = 19069
57263 - 19069 = 38194
So, y804 = 38194 which means that y = 7
Therefore the missing digits are 8, 4 and 7.

Answer: (D)
Reasoning: We need to find the values of the three hidden digits such that the sum of the three five-digit numbers is 57263. Let the hidden digits be x, y, and z. The three numbers are 1572x, y804, and 33z1. The sum is 1572x + y804 + 33z1 = 57263.
Units digit: x + 4 + 1 = 3 or x + 4 + 1 = 13. Since x is a digit, it can be at most 9. So, x+5 = 3 or x+5 = 13. Therefore x=8.
Tens digit: 2 + 0 + z = 6, so z=4.
Hundreds digit: 7 + 8 + 3 = 18. We write down 8 and carry-over 1.
Thousands digit: 5 + y + 3 + 1 = 7. Then y + 9 = 17, so y = 7.
Ten thousands digit: 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5, which is consistent with 5.
Therefore, the digits are 8, 7, and 4. However, these digits do not appear in the same order as the options provide. So let us verify our solution:
15728 + 7804 + 3341 = 26873 which is NOT 57263.
Let x+4+1 = 13, then x = 8, then we carry over 1 to tens. 2+0+z+1 = 6. so z=3. No solutions given.
Then let 8, 7 and 2.
units: 8 + 4 + 1 = 13, carry over 1 to tens column
tens: 2 + 0 + z + 1 = 6. so z=3. This means the missing number 8 is the units of 1572, 7 is ten thousands of _804 and the last is not 3.
Instead, we want to get the 10 thousands close to 57263, then 1572x+y804 + 33z1.
x is from units: x+4+1=13
z is from 10: 2+z=6
y is from thousands:
Option D: 2, 7, and 8.
Missing 2 (for units). So 2+4+1=7 (instead of units being 3).
Missing 7 (for ten-thousands): 7 + 1572x + 33z1 should result in number closing to 57263
Missing 8 (unknown).
