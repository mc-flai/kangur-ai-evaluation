Reasoning: The tape goes around the cylinder in increasing order. The visible segments of the tape show numbers in the ranges of 1-10, 22-32, and the question mark segment. Notice that each turn increases by roughly 22. 1 + 22 = 23 (approximately). Thus, we can approximate the value at the question mark by 23 + 22 + 22 which equals 67. The only option close to 67 is 69.
