Reasoning: The question asks for the picture with the lower edge closest to the floor. The nail is hammered between 2m and 2.5m above the floor, and a 2m string is tied to the upper corners of each picture. The height of the triangle formed by the string will influence how far down the picture will hang. We can denote the distance from the nail to the top edge of the picture as 'h'.  The height of the bottom edge from the floor is 'Nail Height' - h - Picture Height.

For the string length to remain the same, as the width increases, the height of the triangle (h) decreases. Thus, the height of the bottom edge will be greater than the height of the top edge from the ground minus the picture's height. Therefore, a smaller value of Picture Height yields the lower edge nearest to the floor.

Therefore, the lowest picture height among the available choices is the answer.

A) 60 x 40
B) 120 x 50
C) 120 x 90
D) 160 x 60
E) 160 x 100

The minimum picture height among the above is 40.

Answer: A)
