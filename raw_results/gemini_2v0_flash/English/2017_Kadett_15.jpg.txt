Reasoning:
Let $F$ be the number of female participants and $M$ be the number of male participants.
We are given that 35% of the participants are female, so $F = 0.35 \times \text{Total}$, where Total is the total number of participants.
Since the remaining participants are male, we have $M = 0.65 \times \text{Total}$.
We are also given that there are 252 more male than female participants, so $M - F = 252$.
Substituting the expressions for $M$ and $F$ in terms of Total, we get:
$0.65 \times \text{Total} - 0.35 \times \text{Total} = 252$
$0.30 \times \text{Total} = 252$
$\text{Total} = \frac{252}{0.30} = \frac{2520}{3} = 840$
Also, we are told that the total number of participants is more than 800, which is true for our calculated value.
