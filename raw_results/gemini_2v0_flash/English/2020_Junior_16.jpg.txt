Reasoning:
Let the first two digits of the four-digit number be represented by $xy$, where $x$ is the tens digit and $y$ is the units digit. Since the number is a four-digit number, the first digit $x$ can take values from 1 to 9, and the second digit $y$ can take values from 0 to 9. Therefore, the two-digit number $xy$ can range from 10 to 99.
The question states that the number formed by the first two digits is equal to the number formed by the last two digits. So, the four-digit number can be represented as $xyxy$. The possible values for the two-digit number $xy$ are from 10 to 99.
To find the number of such four-digit numbers, we need to count the number of possible values for $xy$. Since $xy$ ranges from 10 to 99, the number of possible values is $99 - 10 + 1 = 90$.

Answer: (D)
