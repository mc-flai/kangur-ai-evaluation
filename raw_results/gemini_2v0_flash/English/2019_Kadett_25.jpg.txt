Reasoning:
Let's trace the number of pralines day by day.
- Initially, Elisabeth has 60 pralines.
- Monday: Eats 1/10 of 60, which is 6. Remaining pralines: 60 - 6 = 54.
- Tuesday: Eats 1/9 of 54, which is 6. Remaining pralines: 54 - 6 = 48.
- Wednesday: Eats 1/8 of 48, which is 6. Remaining pralines: 48 - 6 = 42.
- Thursday: Eats 1/7 of 42, which is 6. Remaining pralines: 42 - 6 = 36.
- Friday: Eats 1/6 of 36, which is 6. Remaining pralines: 36 - 6 = 30.
- Saturday: Eats 1/5 of 30, which is 6. Remaining pralines: 30 - 6 = 24.
- Sunday: Eats 1/4 of 24, which is 6. Remaining pralines: 24 - 6 = 18.
- Next day: Eats 1/3 of 18, which is 6. Remaining pralines: 18 - 6 = 12.
- Next day: Eats 1/2 of 12, which is 6. Remaining pralines: 12 - 6 = 6.
