Reasoning: We need to visually estimate the proportion of black area in each square and determine which one has the most.
A has 2/4 black area = 50%
B has 5/9 black area = 55.55%
C has 4/9 black area = 44.44%
D has 5/9 black area = 55.55%
E has 4/9 black area = 44.44%
Both B and D are equal so there must be a mistake so lets carefully review the blocks in the image. Square B: 5 blocks of black color and 4 blocks of white. Square D: 5 blocks of black color and 4 blocks of white.

Answer: B)
