Reasoning:
The pool is 10m wide and 25m long. The instructor sits in the middle of one of the edges.
Let's consider the instructor sits in the middle of one of the longer edges (25m). Then the distance from the instructor to the nearest corners are each 25/2 = 12.5m.
The longest distance from each of those two corners is 10 + 12.5 = 22.5m.
For the other two corners, the distance will be 10 + 25 + 12.5 = 47.5m.

The total distance will be 2 * 22.5 + 2 * 47.5 = 45 + 95 = 140m.

Now consider the instructor sits in the middle of one of the shorter edges (10m). Then the distance from the instructor to the nearest corners are each 10/2 = 5m.
The longest distance from each of those two corners is 25 + 5 = 30m.
For the other two corners, the distance will be 25 + 10 + 5 = 40m.
The total distance will be 2 * 30 + 2 * 40 = 60 + 80 = 140m.

In both cases the answer is 140m.
