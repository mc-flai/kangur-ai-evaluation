Reasoning:
We need to find the last year before 2014 where the last digit was greater than the sum of the first three digits.
We can check years starting from 2013 going backwards:
- 2013: 2 + 0 + 1 = 3. The last digit is 3. 3 is not greater than 3.
- 2012: 2 + 0 + 1 = 3. The last digit is 2. 2 is not greater than 3.
- 2011: 2 + 0 + 1 = 3. The last digit is 1. 1 is not greater than 3.
- 2010: 2 + 0 + 1 = 3. The last digit is 0. 0 is not greater than 3.
- 2009: 2 + 0 + 0 = 2. The last digit is 9. 9 is greater than 2.

So the last year was 2009. The difference between 2014 and 2009 is 2014 - 2009 = 5.
