Reasoning:
Dice with four faces coloured will be those that are on an edge but not a corner. We need to count the number of such dice.
- The top vertical stack has 3 dice. The middle die will have 4 faces coloured.
- The bottom horizontal section has 5 dice. The three middle dice will have 4 faces coloured.
- The upright section on the right has 4 dice. The two middle dice will have 4 faces coloured.
So, we have 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 dice that are on the edges but not corners. Additionally the corners will have three faces painted. Also there will be dice that are glued so that the entire face of the inner face is also not painted.
Looking at the diagram, the corners have three faces painted.
The interior dice have at most 3 painted faces.
Dice with four faces coloured in:
Top vertical column: 1
Bottom row: 3
Right vertical column: 2
Total = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 + 3 corner ones to add up to 9
Thus, the total number of such dice is 9.
