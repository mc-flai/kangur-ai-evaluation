Reasoning: We want to make the largest number possible using 7 matchsticks. Since the number of matchsticks used to form 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are 6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, and 6 respectively, we should use as many numbers that require less matchsticks as possible at the highest place value, in order to obtain the largest number.

With 7 matchsticks, we could make:
- 7 ones (1111111)
- A seven and two ones (711)
- One 7 and one four (74)
- One 7 and one zero: impossible (7 matchsticks required for each)

The largest number will be composed of as many ones as possible. Let's try different combinations:
- Two numbers: We can use 7(3 sticks) and 4(4 sticks): Number will be 74
- Three numbers: We can use 7(3 sticks) and two ones(2 sticks each): Number will be 711.

Comparing 711 and other values that are easily calculated, it is clear that 711 is the greatest possible number. We can eliminate the options that are clearly less than 711. From the remaining options, (A) 31, (B) 51, (C) 74, and (D) 711, 711 is largest.
8 needs 7 matchsticks, and 0 also needs 6, so we can't form the number 800 since 8 requires 7 matchsticks.

So, 711 should be the correct answer.

Answer: D)
