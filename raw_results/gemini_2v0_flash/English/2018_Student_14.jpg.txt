Reasoning:
The octahedron can be viewed as two square pyramids glued together at their bases. The vertices of the octahedron are at the midpoints of the faces of the cube.
Let the vertices of the cube be (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,1). Then the vertices of the octahedron are (1/2, 0, 1/2), (0, 1/2, 1/2), (1/2, 1, 1/2), (1, 1/2, 1/2), (1/2, 1/2, 0), (1/2, 1/2, 1). The side length of the square at the base is sqrt((1/2)^2+(1/2)^2)=1/sqrt(2). Thus, the area of the square is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2. The height of each pyramid is 1/2. The volume of one pyramid is (1/3)*(base area)*height = (1/3)*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/12. Thus the volume of the octahedron is 2*(1/12) = 1/6.
