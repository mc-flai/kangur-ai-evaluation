Reasoning:
The bottle is half full, so it contains 0.5 liters of syrup. The syrup to water ratio is 1:7.
To make 2 liters of juice, let the amount of syrup required be 'x' liters.
Then the amount of water required is 7x liters.
The total volume of the juice is x + 7x = 8x liters.
We want the total juice volume to be 2 liters, so 8x = 2.
Thus, x = 2/8 = 1/4 liters.
The bottle has 0.5 liters of syrup, and we need 1/4 liters. The required fraction is (1/4) / (1/2) = (1/4) * (2/1) = 1/2.

Answer: B)
