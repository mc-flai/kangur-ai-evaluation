Reasoning:
A) 6^13: This is not a perfect square or a perfect cube.
B) 5^12 = (5^6)^2 = (5^4)^3: This is both a square and a cube.
C) 4^11 = (2^2)^11 = 2^22 = (2^11)^2. This is a perfect square.
D) 3^10 = (3^5)^2: This is a perfect square.
E) 2^9 = (2^3)^3: This is a perfect cube.

Therefore, the only option that is neither a square nor a cubic number is A.

Answer: A)
