Reasoning:
The set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} has a sum of 21. For each row to be divisible by 3, it needs to sum to 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18.
The possible row sums that are divisible by 3 are 6, 9, 12, and 15. If one row is x then other row sum must be 21-x.
x = 6, 21-x = 15;
x = 9, 21-x = 12;
If rows sum to 6,15 -> choose 2 numbers sum 6: {1,5}, {2,4}, {3,3}
If rows sum to 9,12 -> choose 2 numbers sum 9: {1,8}, {2,7}, {3,6}, {4,5}
Since the columns must each sum to a multiple of 3, the numbers in each column must either sum to 3, 6, or 9.
To solve this problem, first group the numbers into those congruent to 0, 1, and 2 mod 3.
0 mod 3: {3, 6}
1 mod 3: {1, 4}
2 mod 3: {2, 5}
Each column must contain numbers that sum to a multiple of 3. That means each column must be one of the following combinations: {0, 0}, {1, 2}, {0, 1, 2}. Since the numbers in our set are 1 to 6, we can only have each column as sum of two numbers.
The valid columns are:
3 = 1+2
6 = 1+5 = 2+4 = 3+3
9 = 3+6 = 4+5
12 = 6+6 (not possible)

Total = 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21.
Since each row must add to a multiple of 3, it must be 6, 9, 12, or 15.
If first row is 6, other row is 15. 1+2+3 = 6.
If first row is 9, other row is 12. 1+2+6 = 9.
If first row is 12, other row is 9. 4+2+6 = 12.
If first row is 15, other row is 6. 4+5+6 = 15.
We need to divide the numbers 1 to 6 into two rows of three such that both the row sums and the column sums are divisible by 3.

The number of ways is 42.
