Reasoning: The block is made of 3x3x3 = 27 cubes. Since white and colored cubes are in equal amounts, there are 27/2 = 13.5, which is not possible. Thus, the total amount of cubes is not 3x3x3=27. Let's count the number of white cubes that are visible in the diagram: 4 on the front, 2 on the side, 1 on the top, and 0 on the bottom. That means that 4+2+1=7 are visible. Therefore, 7 white cubes are visible, and there should be an equal number of colored cubes. The diagram has 7 colored cubes on the front, top, and side. Thus there are 7 colored cubes. This indicates a total of 14 cubes. Since Maria made the blocks using white cubes and colored cubes in equal amounts, there are 14/2 = 7 white cubes and 7 colored cubes. Since we can see 7 white cubes, we can see all the white cubes. The diagram shows that there are 4 in the first row, 2 in the 2nd row and 1 in the last row for a total of 7 visible white cubes. There are 7 colored cubes visible.
There are 27 total cubes in a 3x3x3 cube. If we assume there are equal amounts of white and colored cubes, then it's impossible to split the 27 cubes equally.
Visible: 7 white and 7 colored. Hidden total = 27 - 14 = 13 cubes total.
Hidden cubes should be 13/2 = 6.5, or rounded, 6 hidden white and 7 hidden colored. Thus the question is how many hidden white cubes there are.
From the front, we see the front face, which has 3x3 = 9 cubes. We see 4 white and 5 colored.
From the side, we see 2 white and 1 colored, assuming the middle column is all colored.
The top shows 1 white and 2 colored, so there must be more behind that we cannot see.
Given there are a total of 7 visible, we need to find out how many are not visible.

If we suppose it's a 3x3x2 or 3x2x2, since a 3x3x3 is not possible with 27. A 3x3x2 gives 18 blocks with 9 white and 9 colored. A 3x2x2 gives 12 blocks with 6 white and 6 colored. If it's 12 blocks, 6 white and 6 colored, the figure does not match.
Let's suppose it's a 3x3x2 which has 18 total blocks with 9 white and 9 colored. Visible white is 4+2+1 = 7. So 9-7=2. Then we need 2 hidden white cubes, and also visible colored is 5+1+2=8. With 9-8 = 1 missing, the answer is 2.
2 are hidden.
