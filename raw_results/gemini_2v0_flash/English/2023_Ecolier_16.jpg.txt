Two blocks consist of 10 rectangles. I need to check each figure and see how many of them consist of 10 rectangles, which means they can be made with the 2 blocks.
A: has 10 rectangles so it can be made.
B: has 10 rectangles so it can be made.
C: has 10 rectangles so it can be made.
D: has 10 rectangles so it can be made.
E: has 10 rectangles so it can be made.
