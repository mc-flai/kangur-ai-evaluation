Reasoning: We can determine the number on the colored triangle by carefully observing the sequence of numbers in the given picture and the configuration of the piece. Looking at the given pieces, we see that each piece has 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The piece in the crown is arranged such that we can read the sequence 1, 2, 3...etc. Therefore, we can continue to read the sequence to the piece that has the colored triangle. Following the sequence, we see the last number shown in the picture is 5, so the following piece should start with the number 1.

Answer: A)
