Reasoning:
First, calculate the current sum of the top row: 7 + 5 + 4 + 2 + 8 + 3 + 2 = 31
Next, calculate the current sum of the bottom row: 4 + 3 + 5 + 9 + 7 + 7 + 4 = 39
The difference between the sums is 39 - 31 = 8.
We need to find a card where turning it upside down will reduce the bottom row sum by 4 (half of 8) and increase the top row sum by 4 so that the difference becomes 0. This means we are looking for a card with a difference of 8 (since flipping it changes each row by half of that 8).

Card A: 7-4 = 3
Card B: 5-3 = 2
Card C: 4-5 = -1
Card D: 2-9 = -7
Card E: 8-7 = 1
Card F: 3-7 = -4
Card G: 2-4 = -2
However, instead of each changing by half the amount of the total difference, flipping one will have a different effect on the totals, the difference between the numbers must equal the difference between the sums of 8. The only pair of numbers where the difference between them equals 8 is card D with 2 and 9.
If we turn the card D, the sum of the top row is now: 7 + 5 + 4 + 9 + 8 + 3 + 2 = 38.
The sum of the bottom row is now: 4 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 7 + 7 + 4 = 32.
Instead, we can think of this as reducing the total difference by twice the amount difference between the top and bottom of a particular card.

The current total of both sums combined = 31 + 39 = 70.
Let's denote the equalized total by T. So, 2T = 70 and T = 35.
Let's say we flip card x with values top = t_x and bottom = b_x.
So to make the top and bottom row sums equal, the top row must increase to 35, therefore we need an equation such that
31 - t_x + b_x = 35. So 31 + (b_x - t_x) = 35, and b_x - t_x = 4.
Looking through all of the cards, only card D gives the value where (b_x - t_x) = 9 - 2 = 7. I made a mistake! This equation only tells us how much to increase the top row to make the total equal to 35.
Instead, think of the problem as flipping one card, meaning, increasing the sum of the numbers on the top row AND decreasing the bottom row simultaneously. That would mean the difference in numbers is *half* the total difference of the numbers. The current difference is 8. The card we flip would need to have a top and bottom difference of *eight*. That narrows the choice to D.
If you flip card D (2/9), the top row is 7 + 5 + 4 + 9 + 8 + 3 + 2 = 38, the bottom row is 4 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 7 + 7 + 4 = 32.

**Revised reasoning:** The difference in the sums is 39 - 31 = 8. Turning a card swaps the top and bottom numbers. Thus, the difference between the top and bottom numbers on the card that needs to be turned must be equal to the current difference between the sums, which is 8. The difference between the numbers on card D (2 and 9) is |9 - 2| = 7. Therefore, if we flip card D, then the top becomes 7+5+4+9+8+3+2 = 38, and the bottom row becomes 4+3+5+2+7+7+4=32, so this is not correct.

Okay, let's subtract twice that difference: 39 - 2*(9-2) = 39 - 2 * 7 = 39-14 = 25, is not the total for either row when they equal.

The correct way is for there to be a difference of 8. 31+8=39, and 39-8=31, that means D has to be flipped, then, 7+5+4+9+8+3+2=38 and 4+3+5+2+7+7+4 = 32. The difference is 6.

Reasoning:

Let's revisit this problem.
Current Top row sum is 31.
Current Bottom row sum is 39.
Difference = 8.
We need to reduce this difference to 0 by flipping one card. If we flip card D (2/9), then the top row becomes 31 - 2 + 9 = 38, and the bottom row becomes 39 - 9 + 2 = 32. Still a difference of 6, so not card D.
If the top increases by x and the bottom decreases by x. Then if the card to be switched has the top number a and bottom number b, then difference of (a-b). We are looking for a difference of 8. So |9-2| is not 8. If we want the totals of top/bottom to be 35 each (70 in all - already known value). Then to change a single pair of numbers, this is where the individual card value makes a difference and the amount it will add or subtract to top/bottom rows respectively.

Okay. It's all simpler. We want to *reduce* the *bottom* row by half the difference, and *increase* the *top* row by half the difference. Half of 8 is 4. So the bottom has to change from 9 to 2, to subtract 7 and the other card flipped had to add 7, etc... The card numbers cannot change this way without it being what has to be flipped.

This means the BOTTOM row of card *must* be *HIGHER* than the top row of that SAME card.

Let 'x' be the difference of the card we look for, then if TOP + x = BOTTOM - x.
(31 + x = 39 - x), so then x = (39 - 31) / 2, OR (BOTTOM - TOP)/2 = 4.

So card (D) = (-7); therefore, if a card has a value where 1 card top is higher or lower than 4 from their value, it will become 8. Since (B is 2); that one will work too. The difference is (A) is (3), etc.

For card A the difference is 3. For card B the difference is 2. For card C it is -1. For card D is -7, For card E is 1, for card F is -4, for card G is -2

If we flipped A then 39-4+7 = 39+3 which will not be correct and so on.

The key is that |top - bottom| = 8.

Reasoning: Re-evaluating the whole problem.
Current difference is 8, so if the two rows are to be equalized, they need to be 4 different on EACH row - from original sum, since by flipping a card the addition has to work, just like when there's a card on top that you switch to the bottom row; this does not happen here. (a-b)/2.

Okay, then what card needs to be flipped so it will become 8. That would be correct. That is 7 (9-2). Then card is D. If you flip, 7. This is 2/9= D - so let's flip that:
TOP=39. BOT= 31

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let's re-examine and clarify the logic:
1. **Calculate the Difference:** The difference between the bottom row sum (39) and the top row sum (31) is 8.  This difference needs to be eliminated.
2. **Effect of Flipping a Card:** When a card is flipped, the top row's sum *increases* by the difference between the bottom and top numbers of that card, and the bottom row's sum *decreases* by the same amount.
3. **Finding the Correct Card:**  To eliminate the difference of 8, the card that is flipped must have a difference of 8 between its bottom and top numbers. The bottom number must be greater than the top number. Because of flipping a card both rows will change by the same value - this change affects twice what the value difference between the two.
    * If the *difference* between the rows is 8, we need the bottom of the card to reduce total, meaning flipping of any given value must take the difference between to 4, because changing x becomes 2x is amount changing/required amount change. 8/2 = 4: (39 to 35) - by -4.
There seems to be error, so the top must have some way to contribute to bottom - if there 7 cards, all must affect one another for equal distribution - because 4+7 card must increase 38 = 36+2.
None of that seems right.
-Let's simplify so that we simply must find the sum, by adding value and decrease value from respective sums. So 1/7 values will contribute.
The problem requires a difference. We want a bottom value to be a *minimum* amount to 4 - and TOP increases 4.

There seems like a missing point here, the answer is not immediately apparent.
Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let Top_sum = sum of the top numbers of the cards = 31
Let Bottom_sum = sum of the bottom numbers of the cards = 39
Let x and y be the numbers on the top and bottom of the card that is turned over.

Then, we want to find x and y such that if we switch those, we would get
Top_sum - x + y = Bottom_sum - y + x
31 - x + y = 39 - y + x
2y - 2x = 8
y - x = 4

Among the cards, the difference of 4 between y and x is present in card F where top is 3 and bottom is 7. 7 - 3 = 4.
