Reasoning:
The cat walks along the dotted line, which is in the middle of the room. The total distance the cat walks is the sum of the lengths of the dotted lines. These lengths are 40 m, 20 m, and 36 m.
Therefore, the total distance is 40 + 20 + 36 = 96 m.
It seems there is an error in the question because none of the options equals 96 m.
Also, it looks like there is a diagram and not a right angle connecting the 36m section and 40 m section. Thus the length of the middle line could be shorter. 
Let's assume that the width of the top corridor is 4m (instead of 8m) and the path of the cat runs along the middle. Then, the dotted line along the top would have length 36m. The dotted line on the right side of the figure would have length 20m. The dotted line on the bottom would have length 40 m. So the total length is 36+20+40 = 96m.
Let's examine the figure and suppose the top part has dimension 36 m and bottom part has dimension 40 m. We need to find the length of the middle part (represented by the dotted line). Let us assume the corridor makes a right angle. Then we are looking for 40 + 20 + 36 = 96 which is still not the right answer.
Let's re-examine the diagram. The cat walks 40 m, then makes a right angle and walks 20 m, then makes another right angle and walks 36 m. The total distance is 40 m + 20 m + 36 m = 96 m. None of the choices equal 96 m. Thus, there must be an error. 
We are given choices 75, 77, 79, 81, 83.
Let's approximate that the length of the middle part is a little less, say 1 m. In the other words the actual total length of the dotted lines are shorter due to the corner. Thus 96 - 1 = 95. Still this is not the right answer.

Consider the given choices again. We want to compute 40+20+36 = 96. 
The closest value to 96 is option E, 83.
We can also look for a possible mistake in the given problem.

Let us assume the bottom dimension is 35 instead of 40, the result would be 35 + 20 + 36 = 91, still none of the choices is correct. Let us assume the right dimension is 17 instead of 20, then 40 + 17 + 36 = 93, this is still not correct. 

After careful consideration and re-examination of the question and diagram, I believe that the correct approach is to sum the lengths of the three sections of the dotted line: 40 m + 20 m + 36 m = 96 m. However, none of the provided answer choices match this result. The closest option is 77 m. But, I cannot find a mistake to obtain 77. Maybe the problem has mistakes.
Let us make a guess and assume that option B is the right answer.

Reasoning: Upon re-examining the problem, it appears that I may have made an error in my initial calculation. The dimensions given are 40, 20, and 36. By adding the three lengths, the cat walked 40+20+36=96 meters. But, my first answer was wrong.
I will choose the closet answer to the true answer of 96.
Between the given choices, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, the number closest to 96 is 83.

Answer: E)
