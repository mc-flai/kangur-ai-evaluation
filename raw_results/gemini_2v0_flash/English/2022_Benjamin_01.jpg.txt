Reasoning: We need to connect the even numbers (2, 4, 6) with lines and connect the odd numbers (1, 3, 5) with lines to create two triangles.
The even numbered points (2,4,6) form one triangle, and the odd numbered points (1,3,5) form another triangle. If we draw these triangles on the given numbered points, it creates the shape as shown in option E.

Answer: E)
