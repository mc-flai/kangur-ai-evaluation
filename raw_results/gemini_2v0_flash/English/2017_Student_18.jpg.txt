Reasoning:
We are looking for two consecutive numbers, n and n+1, such that the sum of the digits of each number is divisible by 7. We want to minimize the number of digits of n.
Let's start by checking if a 3 digit number can satisfy this condition. For example, let n = 699, sum of digits is 6+9+9=24, which is not divisible by 7. n+1 = 700, sum of digits is 7, which is divisible by 7. Now, let's try to find a 3 digit number n such that its digits sum to a multiple of 7, and n+1 sums to a multiple of 7.
If n ends in 9, adding 1 would mean that the units digit changes to a 0, which might decrease the digit sum.
Try to find a number of the form x999 such that x+9+9+9=x+27 is divisible by 7.
If x=1, then x+27=28, divisible by 7. So 1999, then 2000. Sum of digits of 1999 is 28. Sum of digits of 2000 is 2. No.
If x=8, then x+27=35, divisible by 7. So 8999, then 9000. Sum of digits of 8999 is 35. Sum of digits of 9000 is 9. No.
However, we are looking for consecutive numbers such that each sum of digits is divisible by 7.
Consider n=699999. The digit sum is 6+6(9)=6+54 = 60. Since we need a multiple of 7, consider adding 4 to make this 60+4 = 63.
Consider n=469999, whose sum is 4+6(9)=4+54=58. Not divisible by 7.
Let n=699999, sum of digits is 6+9*5=51. We want sum divisible by 7. Try n=69999. 6+45=51.
Let n=69999. Sum = 51. Try n+1 = 70000. Sum is 7. To get from 51 to multiple of 7, add 2 to get to 56, or subtract 2 to get to 49.
However, let n=6999. Sum is 6+27 = 33. No. Let n=199999. Sum is 1+5*9=46. No.
Trying a 6 digit number of the form 699999. Sum = 6+54=60.
Consider n = 699993. Sum = 6+5*9+3 = 54. Not divisible by 7.
Let's test (D) n has 6 digits
Smallest n is 100000. Then the sum is 1. Next multiple of 7 is 7.
Try starting with 699999, whose digit sum is 6+9*5 = 51. Not a multiple of 7.
The next number n+1 = 700000, whose sum is 7. Multiple of 7.

Let n = 699999. Sum is 60. Not multiple of 7. Let's modify this number.
So if n=699998, sum is 59. No. n=699992, sum is 56. Then n+1 = 699993. 6+45+3=54. No.
Consider n=559999. Digit sum is 5+5+45 = 55. n+1=560000, Digit sum is 11.

Consider the 6-digit number $699992$. The sum of its digits is $6 + 5(9) + 2 = 6 + 45 + 2 = 53$. Let's try $699993$. The sum of digits is $6 + 5(9) + 3 = 6 + 45 + 3 = 54$.
Trying with more digits would get tricky. It is also computationally difficult to search for a number this way.

Consider n to be 5-digits:
if n = 69999 : sum is 6+9+9+9+9 = 6+36 = 42 divisible by 7
n+1 = 70000 = 7 is also divisible by 7.

So, n=69999. Number of digits is 5. Thus (C)

Reasoning:
We need two consecutive integers where the sum of digits is divisible by 7. We can look at cases where n ends with multiple nines.
69999: the sum of digits is 6+4*9=42, divisible by 7
70000: the sum of digits is 7, divisible by 7
Therefore n=69999 has 5 digits and the next number is 70000

Answer: C)
