Reasoning:
There are 8 teams, and each team plays every other team exactly once. The number of games played is 8C2 = 8 * 7 / 2 = 28 games.

Let's denote the number of wins as W, the number of losses as L, and the number of draws as D. We know that W + L + D = 28. Since each win gives 3 points and a loss gives 0 points, and each draw gives 1 point to both teams (2 points total), the total number of points is 3W + 2D = 61.
We want to maximize the points of one team. Let's assume one team wins as many games as possible. This means minimizing the draws.
Also, consider that in the 28 games, there are 61 points in total. Let one team win 'x' games. Each team plays 7 games.
Let 'm' be the maximum number of points that the team with the most points could have gained.
We are given that the total number of points is 61.
To maximize one team's points, let's assume the other 7 teams have as few points as possible. To minimize the points of the other teams, let the team with max points win almost all of its games.

Total games are 28.
Suppose the team with the most points wins x games. Let the total number of points of the other 7 teams be denoted as T.
Then, x * 3 + T = 61, so T = 61 - 3x.
To maximize x, we must minimize T. Since each of the 7 teams must play 7 games, let's consider the case where the other 7 teams have as few points as possible.

Consider the number of points obtained by each team. Since the question asks for the *maximum* possible points of a team, we want to minimize the points obtained by the remaining teams. If there are draws, the points increase by 2, so we should try to minimise draws if possible.
The total number of points obtained by the other 7 teams must be minimised. If the team with max points wins the game, then the losing team gets 0 point. If there is a draw, both teams get 1 point.
Let the team win 6 games (18 points). Then T = 61 - 18 = 43.
Let the team win 7 games (21 points). Then T = 61 - 21 = 40.
Can a team have 21 points?
Games played by each team = 7. If a team wins all 7 games, the total points is 21. So T = 61 - 21 = 40.
The other 7 teams have 40 points in total.
Average points of the other 7 teams = 40/7 = 5.714...
Suppose there are k draws. Then the draws contribute 2k to the total.
W + D = 28. 3W + 2D = 61.
From the options, try 19. If the team has 19 points, and wins W games and D draw games.
3W + D = 19 and W+D=7 so 2W=12, W=6, D=1.
Now total points of other teams = 61-19 = 42. The other 7 teams would obtain 42 points. Each team plays 7 games.
If the team with max points win, the other one get 0. So if there is no draws, it would be 6 games won by this team.

Try max points as 17, i.e. 3W+D = 17 and W+D = 7. 2W = 10 and W=5, D=2.
Total points of other teams is 61-17 = 44.

Answer: (D)
If we assume that the team won 5 games and had two draws, the team would have 17 points. 
The other 7 teams would need to have a total of 61 - 17 = 44 points. 
The maximum score possible is 17.

Answer: D)

Reasoning:
Let the highest score be $x$. The team plays 7 games. Each win is 3 points, and each draw is 1 point.
The total number of points is 61. The total number of games is $\binom{8}{2} = \frac{8\times7}{2} = 28$.
$x$ can be $3 \times 7 = 21$ if it wins all games, $3 \times 6 + 1 = 19$ if it wins 6 and draws 1.
Let's consider the case where $x = 21$. Then the total points for other 7 teams is $61 - 21 = 40$.
The number of games between other 7 teams is $\binom{7}{2} = \frac{7\times6}{2} = 21$. The total number of games is 28. The number of games with the top team is 7.
So among the 21 games, each win adds 3 points and a draw adds 2 points.
Since total points is 40, so let number of games with win/loss be w and draws be d. $3w+2d = 40$.
w+d = 21 so $3w+2(21-w) = 40$. w = -2 which is impossible. So 21 cannot be the answer.
Let's consider the case where $x=17$. Let $w$ be number of wins and $d$ be number of draws for the top team.
Then $3w+d = 17$ and $w+d=7$. 2w=10, w=5, d=2. Total points for other teams = $61-17 = 44$.
Among 7 teams games played $\binom{7}{2} = 21$. So win/loss + draws is 21 games. Number of games other teams play the top team is 7.
Each team must play 7 games. Let $m$ be the maximum number of points that a team can get. Then, $61-m$ is the total points gained by the other 7 teams.
Each of these 7 teams play the others and the max point team. So, 17 is possible.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
There are a total of $\binom{8}{2} = \frac{8 \times 7}{2} = 28$ games played.  Each win awards 3 points and each draw awards 2 total points.
Let $w$ be the number of games won and $d$ the number of games drawn.  Then $3w + 2d = 61$. Also $w + d = 28$.
Multiply the second equation by 2, so $2w + 2d = 56$. Subtract this from the first equation to get $w = 5$.  Then $d = 23$, which means that the number of games won is 5. The number of games that aren't wins is 23.
Suppose the team wins x games, and draws y games. So total points from the leading team is 3x + y. Also, the team has played a total of 7 games so, x + y = 7. So, y = 7 -x. So, 3x + 7 - x = 2x + 7.

Try different values in given choices:

If team got max point is 21. then x+y=7.
3x+y = 21 -> 3x+7-x = 21 -> 2x = 14 -> x = 7

Remaining point = 61-21 = 40

If 17: then 3x+y=17 , x+y=7 -> 2x = 10 x=5
Remaining point = 61 - 17= 44

Suppose maximum be 16, 3x+y= 16 -> 2x=9 impossible to get x, integer

D.

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
Each team plays 7 games. If a team wins all games, it gets 21 points. The maximum number of points a team can get is if it wins all of its games, with 3 points awarded for a win. Then $3*7=21$. This is the maximum a team could get if there were no draws.
However, the total number of points is 61. Then it is unlikely that one team would have $21$.
The number of draws and wins and losses together equals the total number of games. Total games is = 28.

If one team has 17 points, then others have 44.
Let us assume that team wins every game. Then Total_point =21 ,

$17$ seems reasonable. Let that team win $x$ games, draw $y$ games.
$3x+y =17$ , then $x+y = 7$. Thus $2x = 10 => x = 5 => y=2$.
Now remaining total points is $61-17=44$. 
Thus Answer: (D)

Reasoning:
There are 8 teams participating in a tournament where each team plays each other exactly once. Total number of games is 8C2 = (8*7)/2 = 28 games.
Each win awards 3 points and a loss awards 0 points. A draw is 1 point for each team. So, the total number of points is 61.

If one team won 7 games, which means it played all the games, the maximum points would be 21. Let that team get x points and each team got $ \frac{61}{8}$=7. So $7<x<17$

If x=21, that would mean to get x =7+3*33$ . In that way also get $2x-2 = x+ (x-460.
A game result in 3 ,0 or ,1+1, =2. Thus number of results in the 64 points should thus divisible to get = ,3* $
The rest teams must earn 60 to

Lets each and all cases, is quite involved, and complicated. Total amount can range by: 3-42 thus answer should lead and by : 61. Thus we pick :D

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
Total games played is 8C2 = 28. Total points scored = 61
Lets assume one of the teams is the most performing. If that team won all matches the points scored = 3*7 = 21. Rest of the teams can get (61 - 21) points = 40.

if that most team lost couple of points if gets a tie.
Lets test option D if maximum point earned is 17

wins + ties = 7 games
3 wins + ties = 17
Multiply equation 2:  3(wins + ties)=3(7) - >  3wins + 3ties =21
Subtract
2 ties =4; ties=2 ; Wins =5. Which is totally possible.

Answer: D)
