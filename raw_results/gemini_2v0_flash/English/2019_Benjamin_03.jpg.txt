Reasoning:
The total number of children is 14 (girls) + 12 (boys) = 26.
Half of the group goes for a walk, which is 26 / 2 = 13 children.
To minimize the number of girls in the group that goes for a walk, we need to maximize the number of boys in that group. Since there are only 12 boys, we can have all 12 boys go for a walk.
So, the number of girls in the group for a walk would be 13 (total) - 12 (boys) = 1 girl.
