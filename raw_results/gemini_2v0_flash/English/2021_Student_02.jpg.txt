Reasoning:
First, we need to find the approximate value of the interval's endpoints.
Since 4 < √21 < 5, we can get a closer approximation.
4.  5^2 = 20.25 and 4.6^2 = 21.16, so √21 is between 4.5 and 4.6.
20 - √21 is therefore between 20 - 4.6 = 15.4 and 20 - 4.5 = 15.5.
20 + √21 is between 20 + 4.5 = 24.5 and 20 + 4.6 = 24.6.
Thus, the interval is approximately (15.4, 24.6).
The integers in this interval are 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.
Counting these integers, we find there are 9 integers in the interval.
