Reasoning:
Let $n$ be the number of jumps Viola has made so far.
The total distance jumped so far is $3.80n$.
After the next jump of 3.99m, the mean increases to 3.81m, and the number of jumps is now $n+1$. So, we have:
$\frac{3.80n + 3.99}{n+1} = 3.81$
$3.80n + 3.99 = 3.81n + 3.81$
$3.99 - 3.81 = 3.81n - 3.80n$
$0.18 = 0.01n$
$n = \frac{0.18}{0.01} = 18$
So Viola has made 18 jumps with an average of 3.80m, and then one jump of 3.99m. Now, we have 19 jumps.

Let $x$ be the length of the next jump. Then we want the mean of the $19+1=20$ jumps to be 3.82m.
The total distance jumped after the next jump is $18(3.80) + 3.99 + x = 68.4 + 3.99 + x = 72.39 + x$
$\frac{72.39 + x}{20} = 3.82$
$72.39 + x = 20(3.82)$
$72.39 + x = 76.4$
$x = 76.4 - 72.39$
$x = 4.01$
The length of her next jump must be 4.01 m.
