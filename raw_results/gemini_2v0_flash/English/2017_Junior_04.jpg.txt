Reasoning:
Maria has 24 Euros, and each of her 3 sisters has 12 Euros. The total amount of Euros is 24 + 3 * 12 = 24 + 36 = 60 Euros.
There are 4 people in total (Maria and her 3 sisters).
To have the same amount of Euros, each person should have 60 / 4 = 15 Euros.
Each sister needs 15 - 12 = 3 Euros. Maria has to give each sister 3 Euros.
