Reasoning:
Let's analyze the area of the black parts in each square. We can divide each square into eight equal triangles by the two diagonals and two lines connecting the midpoints of opposite sides.
- In square A, two triangles are black, so the black area is 2/8 of the total area.
- In square B, two triangles are black, so the black area is 2/8 of the total area.
- In square C, two triangles are black, so the black area is 2/8 of the total area.
- In square D, two triangles are black, so the black area is 2/8 of the total area.
Therefore, the total area of the black parts is always equally big.
