Reasoning:
The cards have values 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
Let's test each possible sum of Nadia's cards given in the answer options.
A) 12: Possible combinations are (3, 4, 5). Nadia's product = 3 * 4 * 5 = 60. Riny's cards are (6, 7), Riny's product = 6 * 7 = 42. Sum = 60 + 42 = 102 (not prime).
B) 13: No combination equals 13.
C) 15: Possible combinations are (3, 5, 7) or (4, 5, 6).
If Nadia has (3, 5, 7), Nadia's product = 3 * 5 * 7 = 105. Riny's cards are (4, 6), Riny's product = 4 * 6 = 24. Sum = 105 + 24 = 129 (not prime).
If Nadia has (4, 5, 6), Nadia's product = 4 * 5 * 6 = 120. Riny's cards are (3, 7), Riny's product = 3 * 7 = 21. Sum = 120 + 21 = 141 (not prime).
D) 17: Possible combinations are (3, 7, 7) (not valid, since we only have one 7) or (4,6,7)
Nadia has (5,6,6) = not valid since only one six
If Nadia has (4, 6, 7), Nadia's product = 4 * 6 * 7 = 168. Riny's cards are (3, 5), Riny's product = 3 * 5 = 15. Sum = 168 + 15 = 183 (not prime).
E) 18: Possible combinations are (5, 6, 7). Nadia's product = 5 * 6 * 7 = 210. Riny's cards are (3, 4), Riny's product = 3 * 4 = 12. Sum = 210 + 12 = 222 (not prime).
However, let's try other combinations:
Consider if Riny multiplies to 1, then the cards must be (1,1) so this is not valid
Trying to think systematically what prime we're looking for.
If Nadia has (3,4,6) Product = 72, Remaining (5,7) Product = 35, Sum = 107
If Nadia has (3,5,6) Product = 90, Remaining (4,7) Product = 28, Sum = 118
If Nadia has (3,5,7) Product = 105, Remaining (4,6) Product = 24, Sum = 129
If Nadia has (3,6,7) Product = 126, Remaining (4,5) Product = 20, Sum = 146
If Nadia has (4,5,6) Product = 120, Remaining (3,7) Product = 21, Sum = 141
If Nadia has (4,5,7) Product = 140, Remaining (3,6) Product = 18, Sum = 158
If Nadia has (4,6,7) Product = 168, Remaining (3,5) Product = 15, Sum = 183
If Nadia has (5,6,7) Product = 210, Remaining (3,4) Product = 12, Sum = 222
Try (3,4,5), Nadia sum = 12, Product = 60, Riny (6,7), Sum = 42, Total = 102
Try (3,4,7), Nadia sum = 14, Product = 84, Riny (5,6), Sum = 30, Total = 114
Try (3,5,6), Nadia sum = 14, Product = 90, Riny (4,7), Sum = 28, Total = 118
Try (4,5,6), Nadia sum = 15, Product = 120, Riny (3,7), Sum = 21, Total = 141
Try (3,4,7), Nadia Product = 84, Riny Produt = 30, Sum = 114
Try (3,4,5), Nadia Product = 60, Riny Produt = 42, Sum = 102
It may be worth revisiting the problem statement and try different strategies instead of trying to validate the sum with the product calculation from the values.
The sum of Nadia's cards must equal one of the listed options.

I'm realizing my mistake - The question asks the sum of values of Nadia's cards that results in the PRIME number. Let's try another setup:
Suppose Riny cards produce a value of one (which cannot happen). Then Nadias will have the prime be their own product. We need Nadia Cards whose product is prime. This is also not possible. We can then assume both Nadia and Riny get reasonable cards. The sum of products must then be prime and we can find the sum that matches.
Nadia's sum = X; Then (1. Try Each one)
Nadias cards must be (3, 4, 5 -> sum to 12). Riny must be (6, 7) and their product needs to sum with 3*4*5 to become PRIME
(102 is not prime), So (A) is WRONG
If we list primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223
Looking back, I tried combinations and noted (3,4,6 -> sum to 13) product to 72. the product of riny = 5*7 = 35 then we get product SUM = 107 - THIS WORKS

Answer: B)
Reasoning: Through various calculations, we found that when Nadia is dealt the cards 3, 4, and 6 (summing to 13), her product is 72. Riny is left with 5 and 7, and his product is 35. The sum of their products, 72 + 35 = 107, which is a prime number.

Answer: B)
