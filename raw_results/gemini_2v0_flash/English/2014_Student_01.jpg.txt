Reasoning:
1. Original cube: 5 x 5 x 5 = 125 cubes
2. The base has a 5x5 structure.
3. Count the number of pillars: There are 9 pillars.
4. Each pillar has a height of 3 cubes.
5. Number of cubes in the pillars: 9 x 3 = 27 cubes.
6. Number of cubes in the base: 5 x 5 = 25 cubes.
7. Total number of cubes remaining: 27 + 25 = 52 cubes.
8. Number of cubes removed: 125 - 52 = 73 cubes.
Looking back at the image, I made a mistake in counting the pillars and the height. Let's recalculate this by visualizing and counting the cubes that are left.

Each tower is 4 blocks high.
There are 9 towers.
There is a base that is 5 x 5. This means there are 25 cubes at the base.
The total number of cubes in the towers is 9 towers times 4 cubes per tower is 36.
So total cubes is 25 + 36 = 61.
Thus 125 - 61 = 64.

Reasoning:
The original cube has 5x5x5 = 125 small cubes. The remaining solid has a base of 5x5 = 25 small cubes. There are 9 pillars of height 4. So the pillars have 9x4 = 36 small cubes. The total number of cubes in the solid is 25 + 36 = 61. The number of removed cubes is 125 - 61 = 64.

Answer: C)
