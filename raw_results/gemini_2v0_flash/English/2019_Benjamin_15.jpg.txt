Reasoning: The paper is folded twice, which means that when unfolded, each cut will be multiplied by a factor of 4 (2x2 = 4). Also, there are two cuts that cross each other to make the center of the square into 4 pieces. The whole square that Bridget cuts into is made of 4 layers of paper after folding twice. The two cuts shown form a '+', each cutting through all the layers of the folded paper. This results in 4 x 4 = 16 pieces of paper.
