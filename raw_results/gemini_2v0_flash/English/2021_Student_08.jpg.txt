Reasoning:
A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. In this problem, we are only allowed to use the digits 1, 3, and 5. Therefore, the last digit of the 3-digit number must be 5. For the first two digits, we can use any of the digits 1, 3, or 5. So, there are 3 choices for the first digit and 3 choices for the second digit.
Thus, the total number of 3-digit numbers is 3 * 3 * 1 = 9.
