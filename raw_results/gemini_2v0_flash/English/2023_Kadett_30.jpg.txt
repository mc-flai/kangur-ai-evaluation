Reasoning:
Let $S_6$ be the total score in the first 6 games.
The total score in the 7th, 8th and 9th games is $24 + 17 + 25 = 66$.
The average after 9 games is $\frac{S_6 + 66}{9}$.
The average after 6 games is $\frac{S_6}{6}$.
We are given that $\frac{S_6 + 66}{9} > \frac{S_6}{6}$.
Multiplying both sides by 18 gives $2(S_6 + 66) > 3S_6$, so $2S_6 + 132 > 3S_6$, which means $S_6 < 132$.

Let $x$ be the score in the 10th game.
The total score after 10 games is $S_6 + 66 + x$.
The average after 10 games is $\frac{S_6 + 66 + x}{10} > 22$.
Thus, $S_6 + 66 + x > 220$, which means $x > 220 - 66 - S_6 = 154 - S_6$.
Since we want to minimize $x$, we want to maximize $S_6$.
Since $S_6 < 132$, the largest integer value for $S_6$ is 131.
Therefore, $x > 154 - 131 = 23$. Since $x$ must be an integer, the smallest integer value for $x$ is 24.

Reasoning:
We can also solve this by noting that $S_6 < 132$.
The minimum integer for x occurs when $S_6$ is as close to 132 as possible.
Let $S_6 = 131$.
Then $\frac{131 + 66 + x}{10} > 22$.
$197 + x > 220$, so $x > 23$.
The smallest integer is 24.
