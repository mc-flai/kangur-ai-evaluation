Reasoning:
The 4x1x1 cuboid has 2 white and 2 grey cubes. The total number of cubes in the cuboid that must be built is 2x2x2 = 8 cubes. Therefore the cuboid must use 8/4 = 2 of the 4x1x1 cuboids. So, there must be 2x2=4 white cubes, and 2x2=4 grey cubes.
A) 4 white cubes, 4 grey cubes
B) 4 white cubes, 4 grey cubes
C) 8 grey cubes, 0 white cubes
D) 4 white cubes, 4 grey cubes
E) 6 grey cubes, 2 white cubes

Only options A, B and D have the correct composition of white/grey cubes. Option A, B and D can be constructed using the provided 4x1x1 pieces. Consider the orientation in which the 4x1x1 block can be placed. So all of them are possible.
However, considering the placement of white and grey, it is impossible to construct E. The white squares have to be consecutive for this to be possible.

Reasoning: The large cuboid must have 4 white and 4 grey cubes. Also the pattern should be possible to construct using the given block (2 white and 2 gray). Consider that options A, B and D contains 4 white and 4 grey cubes, while options C and E don't (C and E contains only grey cubes and only 2 white cubes respectively, but we need 4). So they are not options. Furthermore, only option B is feasible to build. Options A and D cannot be built.

Reasoning:
The cuboid to be built has 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 cubes.
Since the given block is made up of 2 white and 2 grey cubes, the larger cuboid must have 4 white and 4 grey cubes, so options C and E are immediately eliminated.

Option A cannot be built, because to get the pattern we see, we must have either two white blocks on the same side, or two grey blocks on the same side. But this would mean that it is placed rotated and so it would ruin the pattern. In other words, if the white and grey blocks are continuous like the smaller cuboid in the image, there should be white/grey on each visible side. This is not the case here.

The answer is B since it uses 4 white cubes and 4 grey cubes, can be built by putting two provided cuboids in the first layer and the other two cuboids in the second layer.

Option D cannot be built. It also requires the same arrangement as option A, thus is not possible.

Answer: B)
