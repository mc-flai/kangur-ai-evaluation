Reasoning: The pattern consists of 4 horizontal sticks, each 5cm long, so 4*5cm = 20cm.
The pattern also includes vertical sticks which are 1cm wide. There are three gaps of 1 cm.
The number of gaps is 3 and are separated by 1 cm
Total width is 20 + 3 * 1 = 23cm
The total length of Susi's pattern is 23 cm.
