Reasoning:
Let's analyze the possible days of the week for the conversation based on the given information about when the bear and panther lie.
*   The bear lies on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. The panther lies on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.
*   The bear said, "Yesterday was one of my lying days." This means the conversation took place on a day after one of the bear's lying days. Possible days are Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.
*   The panther said, "Yesterday was also one of my lying days." This means the conversation took place on a day after one of the panther's lying days. Possible days are Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.

Since the conversation had to have occurred on a day that satisfies both conditions, we need to find the intersection of the two sets of possible days.
*   Possible days for the bear's statement: Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.
*   Possible days for the panther's statement: Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.
There is no intersection between the two sets of days, which means they have to lie, let us analyze all days:
* If the conversation took place on Thursday, the bear is telling the truth (since it lies on Mon, Tue, Wed), and the panther is lying (since it lies on Thur, Fri, Sat). Then "Yesterday was one of my lying days" is true for the panther, as it was Wednesday. For the bear, "Yesterday was one of my lying days" must be false, since yesterday was Wednesday, a lying day. So this case is impossible.

* If the conversation took place on Sunday, the bear is telling the truth (since it lies on Mon, Tue, Wed) and so is the panther. Then "Yesterday was one of my lying days" must be false for the bear, since Saturday is a truthful day for the bear. Likewise, it must be false for the panther, since Saturday is a lying day for it, and therefore "Yesterday was one of my lying days" is a true statement for the panther. So this day is possible.

Let's test if we can have just one of the animals lie.
If the bear lies and the panther tells the truth, then the days for the bear are Mon, Tue, Wed and the days for the panther are Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed. If the bear lies and "yesterday was one of my lying days" is true for the bear, then the actual day before was not a lying day. This is a paradox.
If the bear tells the truth and the panther lies, then the days for the bear are Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon, and Tue and the days for the panther are Thur, Fri, Sat. The same paradox arises in this case.

Let us suppose that both lie. If both animals are lying on a certain day, we have to consider if the following happens:
* Bear lies on Mon, Tue, Wed. Panther lies on Thu, Fri, Sat. So the other days that each tells the truth are reversed.

If they both lie:
The bear is telling the truth that "Yesterday was NOT one of my lying days", which makes the lie, so the actual day was a lying day (Mon, Tue, Wed), meaning it is a Thu, Fri or Sat that is the present day. The panther on the other hand is stating "Yesterday was NOT one of my lying days", when instead the truth is that "yesterday IS one of my lying days". Which means that the truthful days of the panther are what they told and it happened on the Thursday that corresponds with the fact the bear is lying. Therefore it can only take place on Thursday. The present day must be Thur, Fri, Sat.

Reasoning: By considering the constraints and the contradictions in the problem, after careful consideration of the problem's logic, we arrive at the most probable solution.

Answer: A)
Reasoning:
Let's analyze the possible days based on the lies and truths.
* **Bear:** Lies on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Tells the truth on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
* **Panther:** Lies on Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Tells the truth on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

Bear says: "Yesterday was one of my lying days."
Panther says: "Yesterday was one of my lying days."

If the bear is telling the truth, yesterday was one of its lying days. This means today could be Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. Since it needs to be one of the days the bear tells the truth AND yesterday was a lying day for the bear (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday), that makes today Thursday. (Yesterday was Wednesday)
If the panther is telling the truth, yesterday was one of its lying days. The present day could be Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. Since it needs to be one of the days the panther tells the truth AND yesterday was a lying day for the panther (Thursday, Friday, Saturday), that makes today Sunday. (Yesterday was Saturday).

If the bear is lying, yesterday was NOT one of its lying days. Today MUST be one of the days the bear lies on, and yesterday it was a day it told the truth. So, today could be Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday and yesterday it was a Thur, Fri, Sat, or Sun. This case is impossible.

If the panther is lying, yesterday was NOT one of its lying days. Today MUST be one of the days the panther lies on, and yesterday it was a day it told the truth. Therefore today is Thu, Fri, or Sat and yesterday was a Sun, Mon, Tue, or Wed. This case is impossible.

If BOTH animals are lying the bear says "Yesterday was NOT one of my lying days" so today must be a day the bear is lying (Mon, Tue, Wed) AND yesterday must be a day where the bear tells the truth so yesterady had to be Thu, Fri, Sat, or Sun. This cannot be true since the lying days of the bear never come directly after the truthful ones.

If the bear is lying and the panther is telling the truth the bear is on Mon, Tue, Wed and tells us yesterday was not a lying day. This contradicts this condition as yesterday would be the day the bear tells the truth to.
If the panther is lying and the bear is telling the truth the panther is on Thu, Fri, Sat and tells us yesterday was not a lying day. This also contridcts the condition.

However it is possible when both are telling the truth. The bear can tell the truth as yesterday was a lying day on Thursday as on Wednesday the Bear lies. And panther can say the truth as yesterday was a lying day on Sunday as on Saturday Panther lies.

Therefore Thursday is the answer
Reasoning: By re-evaluating the constraints and analyzing each possibility through a truth table for the statements and identifying contradictions,

Answer: A)
Reasoning:
Let B represent the bear, and P represent the panther.
Let T represent "telling the truth" and L represent "lying."

B lies on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
P lies on Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

B says, "Yesterday was one of my lying days."
P says, "Yesterday was one of my lying days."

We are looking for the day where their statements hold true given when they lie and tell the truth.
* **If the conversation is on Thursday:** B tells the truth. Yesterday was Wednesday, which is a lying day for B. So B's statement is TRUE. P lies on Thursday. So yesterday was Wednesday, which is a truth day for P. P says "Yesterday was a lying day", which is FALSE.
* **If the conversation is on Sunday:** B tells the truth. Yesterday was Saturday, which is a truth day for B. So B's statement is FALSE. P tells the truth. Yesterday was Saturday, which is a lying day for P. So P's statement is TRUE.

Let's consider the case when the bear lies. If the bear is lying, it means that the statement he made is false. So, "Yesterday was NOT one of my lying days." This means that today must be a lying day for the bear (Mon, Tue, Wed) and yesterday must be a truthful day for the bear.
The days the bear tells the truth are Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. However, none of the lying days Mon, Tue, Wed directly follow.
If the panther lies "Yesterday was not a lying day" therefore it is lying so in fact yesterday it was a day of lying, which corresponds to Thursday, Friday, and Saturday so in turn, yesterday was a truthful day (Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed) which matches up with the fact it has to lie, therefore it must be Thursday and Friday.

Reevaluating, on Thursday, the bear tells the truth and the panther lies, on Friday, they both are not lying.
**Contradiction**
I messed up the previous logic, it means, bear is telling the truth on thurs
If the bear is telling the truth then the day before he was lying therefore must be correct
yesterday
B lies on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday so let us go step by step
B the statement yesterday was one of my lying days" since B must tell the truth then yesterday was one of his lying days and if it's one of his lying days is Mon Tue and Wed since, Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed
Then he said yesterday was one of my lying days"
Therefore must consider it a Thursday the bear tells the truth. The panther would be lying and the opposite applies.

Answer: A)
Reasoning: Let's represent "Yesterday was one of my lying days" as YL.
Bear lies on M, Tu, W. Panther lies on Th, F, Sa.
The key is finding a day where the Bear's and Panther's statements are simultaneously true.
If the day is Sunday, Bear (T) and Panther (T): Bear: Yesterday (Sa) wasn't a lying day (False). Panther: Yesterday (Sa) was a lying day (True). This can't be the case,
If the day is Thursday, Bear (T) and Panther (L): Bear: Yesterday (W) was a lying day (True). Panther: Yesterday (W) wasn't a lying day (False; i.e. telling the truth). It matches

Answer: A)
Reasoning:

* Bear's statement: "Yesterday was one of my lying days."
* Panther's statement: "Yesterday was one of my lying days."

Consider the case when both are telling the truth.

Bear tells the truth: yesterday was Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. So, today is Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.
Panther tells the truth: yesterday was Thursday, Friday, or Saturday. So, today is Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.

The only day that satisfies both cases is Sunday- which means on Sunday the bear is lying. The Panther is telling the truth. That will not satisfy

Now, let's suppose the Bear is telling the truth and therefore the Panther is lying. This must happen on a day when it is
(Sun, Mon, Tue, or Wednesday). Now we test Thursdays: Thursday is a truth and Wednesday. If they were lying, both must make these. If both

In light of Thursday for the bear since before that L. L. L T , P since Thur. F and Sat.

Thus to find The bear since Thur T is when is it true or false so Thursday is likely

Answer: A)
Reasoning:
Let's analyze each day:

*   **Thursday:** Bear is truthful. Panther lies. Bear's statement: Yesterday was Wednesday (a lying day). This is true. Panther's statement: Yesterday was Wednesday (not a lying day). This is false (since Panther is lying, the *truth* is that yesterday *was* a lying day). It is impossible.

**Analyzing all possibilities based on when the animals are lying**

* The bear tells truth and yesterday, which means that Bear (Th,F, Sa, Su) the
   And Panther is lying, so Th, F, Sa, that we are lying.
   Then we need to check the truth so what happens at Thursday at is True and Wednesday's lying day.

Finally A so therefore Thursday
Answer: A)
Reasoning:
B lies on Mon, Tue, Wed
P lies on Thu, Fri, Sat

B says, "Yesterday was one of my lying days."
P says, "Yesterday was one of my lying days."

Let's test each possible day:
* **Thursday**: B tells the truth. Yesterday was Wednesday - a lying day for B. The statement holds.
P lies. Yesterday was Wednesday - *not* a lying day for P. Thus P is LYING when it stated "Yesterday was my lying days". Hence the overall conclusion: *P cannot lie.* because the statement must always be truthful
So: Therefore, all are at Thursday
