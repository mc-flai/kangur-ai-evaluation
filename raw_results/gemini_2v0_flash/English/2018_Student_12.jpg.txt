Reasoning: The graph shows that initially, the height increases rapidly with time, then the rate of increase slows down. This indicates that initially, a small volume is needed to increase the height, and later, a larger volume is needed for the same height increase. This suggests that the vase is wide at the top and narrow at the bottom.
*   A: A cylinder would have a constant increase in height over time.
*   B: This has a narrow section in the middle, followed by a wider section, so it would initially increase rapidly, slow down, then increase again rapidly at the top.
*   C: This is like a sphere; the height increases slowly at first, then more rapidly, then slowly again.
*   D: This is a cone; the height increases rapidly at first, then slower and slower. This corresponds to the shape of the graph.
*   E: The bulb shape at the bottom would make the water level increase very slowly initially, then more rapidly as it reaches the narrow tube.
