Reasoning:
If Monika goes up from the circle marked with x, then she would not be able to reach the white circle to the right of the circle marked with x.
If Monika goes right from the circle marked with x, then the circle directly above the circle marked with x would not be reachable.
If Monika goes left from the circle marked with x, then the circle directly above the circle marked with x would not be reachable.
Thus, Monika needs to move down from the circle marked with x.
