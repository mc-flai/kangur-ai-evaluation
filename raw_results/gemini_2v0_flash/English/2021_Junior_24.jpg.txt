Reasoning:
Let the three scores be $S, J, A$, where $S$ represents Sam's score, $J$ represents James' score, and $A$ represents the third boy's score (let's call him Alex). We are given that $S = 19$ and $J > A > S$. We also know that each boy wrote down 10 words, and thus each boy scored a maximum of $10 \times 3 = 30$ points and a minimum of 0 points.
Let $n_3$ be the number of words that only one person wrote. These words are awarded 3 points each.
Let $n_1$ be the number of words that two people wrote. These words are awarded 1 point each.
Let $n_0$ be the number of words that three people wrote. These words are awarded 0 points each.
We know that the total points awarded is $3n_3 + n_1$. Since there are 3 boys, and each writes down 10 words, the total number of words is 30. Let $n_{unique}$ be the number of unique words written.
Each word written by exactly one person contributes 3 points. Each word written by exactly two people contributes 1 point. Each word written by all three contributes 0 points. Since the total number of words written is 30, it must be the case that if $N$ is the number of unique words, then $N \le 30$. The total points scored by the 3 boys is the sum of the scores.
Sam has 19 points. Let's consider the possible scores. Since $S = 19$, $A > 19$ and $J > A$, we have $J > A > 19$. We need to find a possible value of $J$ among the answer options.
The total number of points awarded is $3n_3 + n_1$, where $n_3 + n_1 + n_0 \le 30$ for any boy individually and $n_3 \le 10, n_1 \le 10$. Also, the total possible points for all the boys is $30*3 = 90$.
Let $J$ be the highest score and $A$ the middle score.
Consider $A = 20$, then we look at $J$.
If $J = 21$, then $S + A + J = 19 + 20 + 21 = 60$.
Consider $J = 23$. $19 + A + 23$, with $A > 19$. So $A$ can be 20, 21, 22. Say $A = 20$, then $19 + 20 + 23 = 62$.
Consider $J = 24$. $19 + A + 24$, with $A > 19$. So $A$ can be 20, 21, 22, 23. Say $A = 20$, then $19 + 20 + 24 = 63$.
Consider $J = 25$. $19 + A + 25$, with $A > 19$. So $A$ can be 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. Say $A = 20$, then $19 + 20 + 25 = 64$.

Since we have to choose an answer, we consider $J=21$.
Let's suppose $S = 19, A = 20, J = 21$. Then $19 + 20 + 21 = 60$. We know that $3n_3 + n_1 = 60$.
Consider the case where the three scores are 19, 23 and 25 respectively.
Then $19+23+25 = 67$.

Without knowing the values of the unique words, it is impossible to accurately assess the value of the scores. The possible values of $J$ are 20, 21, 23, 24, 25. Since $J > A > 19$, $J \ge 21$.
Considering the fact that the options increase relatively gradually, it is not possible to conclusively arrive at an answer using some kind of deduction/elimination. Hence the safest choice is (B).

Reasoning: Since James had the highest score and Sam had the lowest at 19, the other boy's score had to be between 19 and James' score. Given the answer choices, the most plausible choice would be 21. If it was higher like 23, 24 or 25, it would likely imply more unique words.
Answer: B)
