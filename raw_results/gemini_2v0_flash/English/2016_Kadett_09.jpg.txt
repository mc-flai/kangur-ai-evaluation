Reasoning: Let the equal length be x.
Then 1 = a*x and 2 = b*x, where a and b are integers representing the number of pieces.
So x = 1/a and x = 2/b.
Thus 1/a = 2/b, so b = 2a.
The total number of pieces = a + b = a + 2a = 3a.
So the total number of pieces must be a multiple of 3.

Now let's check each option:
A) 6 = 3 * 2. So possible.
B) 8. Not a multiple of 3. So not possible.
C) 9 = 3 * 3. So possible.
D) 12 = 3 * 4. So possible.
E) 15 = 3 * 5. So possible.

Thus, the answer is 8.

Answer: B)
