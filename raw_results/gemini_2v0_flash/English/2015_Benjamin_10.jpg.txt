Reasoning:
Let the length of each strip be 'x'. When two strips are glued together with an overlap of 10cm, the resulting strip is 50cm long. This can be represented as:
x + x - 10 = 50
2x - 10 = 50
2x = 60
x = 30 cm
So each strip is 30 cm long.
Now, we need to find the overlap when the two strips are glued together to form a 56 cm long strip. Let the overlap be 'y'.
x + x - y = 56
30 + 30 - y = 56
60 - y = 56
y = 60 - 56
y = 4 cm
Therefore, the overlap must be 4 cm.
