Reasoning: The distance KL is 11π. The circumference of the circle is 2πr = 2π(1) = 2π. The number of full rotations the circle makes is (11π)/(2π) = 5.5 rotations.
Since the circle starts with the white sector at the bottom, after 5 full rotations, the circle will look exactly the same as when it started. The 0.5 rotation represents half a rotation. After half a rotation, the sector that was initially at the bottom is now at the top. Therefore, the white sector that was initially at the bottom is now at the top.
Thus the circle at point L will have the white sector on top, the dark grey sector to the right, and the black sector to the left.

Answer: A)
