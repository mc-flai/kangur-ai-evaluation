Reasoning:
To solve this problem, we need to visualize how each net folds into a cuboid and trace the path of the loop. We are looking for the net where the loop cannot be formed after folding.

A) The loop can be drawn.
B) The loop can be drawn.
C) The loop can be drawn.
D) The loop can be drawn.
E) The loop can be drawn.

Let's look again at the image. It seems that the image is a bit distorted and cropped, which could have prevented me from seeing that some of the figures do not represent actual nets that can fold into a cuboid. Let's try again. We are looking for the one that cannot be drawn on a closed cuboid.

A) Can be drawn.
B) Can be drawn.
C) Cannot be drawn because the two squares at the bottom need to be adjacent to the center square.
D) Can be drawn.
E) Can be drawn.

Reasoning:
Upon closer inspection, it appears that C cannot be folded into a cuboid because of the way the squares are connected. Thus the line cannot be drawn as a continuous loop.
Answer: C)
