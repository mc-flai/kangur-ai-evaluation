Reasoning: The original diagram shows that the apps are sorted from longest time used to shortest. Two of the apps will have their time halved, and two will remain the same. Therefore, after the change, the bars might not be in the exact order as before.
(A) The top two are the same length as the original, the bottom two are about half the length of the original. This could happen.
(B) The longest bar is still the longest bar, the second one is less long than the first one, but longer than the third and fourth. This could be a valid representation if the second and fourth longest bars are halved.
(C) The longest bar is the same. The third longest is halved. The ranking is still maintained from longest to shortest.
(D) The longest bar is still the longest bar. The second longest is halved. The ranking is still maintained.
(E) The two longest bars have switched, and the bars are no longer sorted from longest to shortest. This is because two apps had their use time halved, which would not change the initial order of the apps.

Answer: E)
