Reasoning:
Let A, B, and P represent the cost of an apple, banana, and pear, respectively.
From the first picture, we have A + P = 5.
From the second picture, we have B + A = 7.
From the third picture, we have P + B = 10.
We need to find the total cost of one apple, one banana, and one pear, which is A + B + P.
We can add the three equations:
(A + P) + (B + A) + (P + B) = 5 + 7 + 10
2A + 2B + 2P = 22
2(A + B + P) = 22
A + B + P = 11
