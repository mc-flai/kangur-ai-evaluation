Reasoning:
Path Q is a straight line from the top corner to the bottom right corner, which represents the shortest distance. Paths P and R consist of horizontal and vertical lines. Because the triangle is equilateral, the sum of the horizontal distances of P is equal to the horizontal distance of Q. Also, the sum of the vertical distances of P is equal to the vertical distance of Q. Thus, the path lengths of P and R will be more than the path length of Q. Paths P and R traverse equal horizontal and vertical distances, thus their lengths are the same.
Therefore P=R<Q.
