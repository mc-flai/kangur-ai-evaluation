Reasoning: First, list the times shown on each clock:
A: 6:00
B: 2:00
C: 4:00
D: 12:00
E: 7:00
One clock is one hour ahead, one clock is one hour behind and one clock is correct. Two clocks have stopped working, which means they are random times.
If the time on clock B, 2:00 is one hour late, then the correct time would be 3:00, in this case, none of the other clocks is one hour ahead.
If the time on clock C, 4:00 is one hour late, then the correct time would be 5:00. In this case, none of the other clocks is one hour ahead.
If the time on clock E, 7:00 is one hour ahead, then the correct time would be 6:00, which matches clock A, this means that clock A is showing the correct time.
Also if the time on clock A, 6:00 is correct, then the time on clock E would be one hour ahead which is consistent with the information from the question.

Answer: A)
