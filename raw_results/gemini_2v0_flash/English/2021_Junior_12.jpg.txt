Reasoning:
Let $a_n$ be the number of ways to reach step $n$ without any restrictions.
Then $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ where $a_1 = 1$ and $a_2 = 2$.
So $a_3 = 3, a_4 = 5, a_5 = 8, a_6 = 13, a_7 = 21, a_8 = 34$.
Since the 6th step is not allowed, the number of ways to reach the 8th step is the number of ways to reach the 8th step directly from the 5th and 7th steps. Since the 6th step is not allowed, we have the number of ways to reach the 8th step from the 5th step by 2 steps, plus the number of ways to reach the 8th step from the 7th step by 1 step.

$a_n$ = number of ways to reach the nth step.
We have $a_1 = 1$, $a_2 = 2$, $a_3 = 3$, $a_4 = 5$, $a_5 = 8$.
Since he can't step on the 6th step, to get to the 7th step, he must go to the 5th step, then step 2 steps, hence, the number of ways to reach the 7th step is the number of ways to reach the 5th step which is 8.
To get to the 8th step, he can go from the 5th step to the 8th step, skipping the 6th and 7th step, or go from the 7th step to the 8th step.
The number of ways to reach the 5th step is 8.
The number of ways to reach the 7th step is 8.
So, the ways to reach the 8th step is $a_7 + a_5$. We know that $a_5 = 8$ and $a_7 = a_5$ here because to reach the 7th step from the start we need to pass the 5th step and then skip the 6th. Now $a_8 = a_5 + a_7 = a_5 + a_5 = 8 + 8 = 16$ by steps of 1 and 2.

However, we want to know the possible ways without stepping on the 6th step. Let the sequence of steps be $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ where each $x_i$ is 1 or 2.
The goal is $x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n = 8$.
We can only go from step 5 to 7, so we must pass steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8.
Ways to go to the 5th step is 8.
Ways to go to the 7th step from the 5th step is 1.
Ways to go to the 8th step from the 7th step is 1.
So $a_5 = 8$ and from 5 to 8, you can add +1, +1, +1. or +1, +2 or +2, +1.
Since the sixth step is forbidden, the only way to get to the 8th step from the 5th step is to use:
(1) 5 -> 7 -> 8 : 8
Hence, number of ways is 8.

Let's enumerate all possibilities such that the sum is 8 and 6 is not possible:
1. 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1
2. 2+1+1+1+1+1+1
3. 1+2+1+1+1+1+1
4. 1+1+2+1+1+1+1
5. 1+1+1+2+1+1+1
6. 1+1+1+1+2+1+1
7. 1+1+1+1+1+2+1
8. 1+1+1+1+1+1+2
Total: 8 ways from 1 and 2 steps
9. 2+2+1+1+1+1 = 8
10. 2+1+2+1+1+1 = 8
11. 2+1+1+2+1+1 = 8
12. 2+1+1+1+2+1 = 8
13. 2+1+1+1+1+2 = 8
Total: 5 ways
14. 1+2+2+1+1+1 = 8
..
Let a(n) = number of ways to get to n.
a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2)

a(1) = 1
a(2) = 2
a(3) = 3
a(4) = 5
a(5) = 8
a(6) = 13
a(7) = a(5) = 8
a(8) = a(7) + a(6)  = 13
a(8) = a(5) + a(7).

To go to 8 steps, first take 5 steps, which is 8 ways, then skip the 6, so only the 7th step can be used.

Reasoning:
Let f(n) be the number of ways to reach step n, using only steps of 1 or 2. If there were no restrictions, then $f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)$, where $f(1) = 1$ and $f(2) = 2$.
Then, $f(3) = 3, f(4) = 5, f(5) = 8, f(6) = 13, f(7) = 21, f(8) = 34$.
However, we cannot step on step 6. So we can reach step 8 either from step 7 with a step of 1 or directly from step 5 by taking a step of 3. Since steps are only 1 or 2, there's no way to jump directly from 5 to 8.

So, to reach step 7, we have to reach step 5 and then step 2 steps, or step directly from step 4 and then step 3 steps, where steps are only 1 or 2, so there's no way to jump directly from 4 to 7.

Therefore, a valid path must go from the 5th to the 7th. We calculate the number of ways to reach 5: f(5)=8. To reach 7 from 5 we must do a step of 2 so we skip the 6th position. Once we reach the 7th step we add a 1 step to the 8th step. So we get 8 combinations.
