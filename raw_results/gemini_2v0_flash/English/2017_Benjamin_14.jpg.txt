Reasoning:
Let the distance covered on Monday be $x$ km. Then the distances covered on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday are $x+2$, $x+4$, $x+6$, and $x+8$ km, respectively.
The total distance covered in the 5 days is 70 km. Therefore,
$x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 70$
$5x + 20 = 70$
$5x = 50$
$x = 10$
The distance covered on Thursday is $x+6 = 10+6 = 16$ km.
