Let C be the amount Claudia spends.
Bettina spends 85% less than Claudia, so Bettina spends 0.15C.
Anna spends 60% more than Claudia, so Anna spends 1.6C.
Together they spend 55 €, so C + 0.15C + 1.6C = 55.
2.75C = 55
C = 55 / 2.75 = 20
Anna spends 1.6C = 1.6 * 20 = 32
Therefore, Anna spends 32 €.

Reasoning: Let the amount Claudia spends be C. We can represent the amount Bettina and Anna spend in terms of C. Then, using the given total amount they spend, we can solve for C. Finally, we can calculate the amount Anna spends.
