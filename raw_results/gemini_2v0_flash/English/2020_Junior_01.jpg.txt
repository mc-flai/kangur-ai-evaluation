Reasoning:
First, calculate the results of each addition:
A) 1 + 2 + 345 = 348
B) 12 + 3 + 45 = 60
C) 1 + 23 + 45 = 69
D) 12 + 34 + 5 = 51
E) 1 + 234 + 5 = 240

Now, write these sums in descending order:
348, 240, 69, 60, 51
The middle sum in this descending order is 69, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C)
