Reasoning: The cube with the question mark touches four other cubes. This eliminates yellow because there is only one yellow cube. It also eliminates green, as there are only two green cubes and they would need to be in the structure above. Looking at the top row, each block in that row is in contact with the block beneath. This eliminates blue since if the cube with the question mark was blue the blocks next to the question mark would also be blue. Finally, red also can't be ruled out completely. Given the constraints that adjacent cubes cannot be the same color. Thus, we can only eliminate the other options but not definitively choose a single answer.

Answer: E)
