Reasoning:
By counting the number of grid lines, we can approximate the length of each wire. For wire 'a', there are 4 horizontal segments and 2 vertical segments. For wire 'b', there are 4 horizontal segments, 2 vertical segments, and 2 diagonal segments. Each diagonal segment has a length of $\sqrt{2}$ grid units, so the total length of wire 'b' is $4 + 2 + 2\sqrt{2}$. For wire 'c', there are 2 horizontal segments, 2 vertical segments, and 1 diagonal segment. Each diagonal segment has a length of $\sqrt{2}$ grid units, so the total length of wire 'c' is $2 + 2 + \sqrt{2}$. Wire 'a' appears to be the longest since it crosses the most horizontal segments. The length of wire 'a' is 6, wire 'b' is $6 + 2\sqrt{2}$ and wire 'c' is $4 + \sqrt{2}$. By comparing the lengths of 'a', 'b', and 'c' we get c < a < b. Rewriting this as the other way around $b > a > c$, so $c < a < b$, which means $c<b<a$.
