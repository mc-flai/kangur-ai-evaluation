Reasoning:
Since the iceberg is in the form of a cube, let's denote the side length of the cube as 's'. The total volume of the iceberg is s^3. The submerged volume is 96.4% of the total volume, which means the volume above the water is 100% - 96.4% = 3.6% of the total volume.
The volume above water is 0.036 * s^3.
The iceberg remains a cube outside the water. Let the height of the iceberg above the water be 'h'.
Then the volume of the iceberg above water is s * s * h = s^2 * h.
Therefore, s^2 * h = 0.036 * s^3, which implies h = 0.036 * s.
The surface area in contact with the air consists of the top surface (s^2) and the four sides from height h (4 * s * h). Thus, air surface area = s^2 + 4sh = s^2 + 4s * (0.036s) = s^2 + 0.144s^2 = 1.144s^2.
The total surface area of the cube is 6s^2.
The percentage of the surface area in contact with the air in relation to the total surface area of the iceberg is (1.144s^2) / (6s^2) * 100% = (1.144 / 6) * 100% = 0.19066 * 100% = 19.066%.
The closest answer choice to 19.066% is 18%.
