Reasoning:
The area of the square is 20 cm², so the side of the square is √20 = 2√5 cm.
Since the side of the square is also the width of the rectangle, the width of the rectangle is 2√5 cm.
The circle is tangent to one side of the rectangle, meaning the diameter of the circle is the length of the rectangle. The radius is half of that.
The square's side is equal to √20. This also equals the distance from the center of the circle to one of the rectangle vertices that are on the circle.
Let the radius be *r*. So, the coordinates of the center of the circle are (2√5, *r*). One point on the circle is (0, 2*r*). The point (0, 2*r*) is also one of the two vertices over the circle.
The distance between (2√5, r) and (0, 2r) is r.
So, using the distance formula: √((2√5 - 0)² + (r - 2r)²) = r
√(20 + r²) = r
20 + r² = r²
This is not correct. I have to find the point where the top vertex lies. Since the top vertex lies at the corner of the square, it sits at (0, r + 2√5). So √((2√5 - 0)² + (r - (r+√20))²) = r
√(20 + (√20)²) = r => √(20 + 20) = r
√40 = r = 2√10
Length = diameter = 2r = 4√10. Width = √20 = 2√5.
Area of the rectangle = L*W = 4√10 * 2√5 = 8√50 = 8*5√2 = 40√2 cm²
But √2 = 1.414 so Area= 56.56 which is not listed
The point on the square that's on the circle has coordinate (0, 2√5 + r), and is a point of the circle. The center of the circle is (2√5, r).
Then r² = (2√5)² + (r - r - 2√5)² or r² = (2√5)² + (-2√5)² or r² = 20 + 20 or r² = 40. So r = 2√10. The side of the square is √20 = 2√5
Length of rectangle = 2r = 4√10. width = 2√5
Area = 8√50 = 40√2 = 56.56 cm².

If the height of the square were sqrt(5) and area = 5 then we have length of the rectangle is twice the radius. r² = (2sqrt(5))² + (r-sqrt(5)-r)²
sqrt((2sqrt(5))² + (-sqrt(5))²) = r, so (20+5) ^.5=r so sqrt25 =5 then length = 10, then area = 2* sqrt5 *10 = 20 sqrt5; something still wrong.

We have r² = (2√5)² + (r-2√5)². So r² = 20 + r²- 4√5 r + 20, 4√5 r = 40, r = 10√5/5 = 2√5
Length = 4√5, width = 2√5 Area= 8*5= 40
Reasoning: After carefully considering the distances and the equation for the circle, the area of the rectangle is 40 cm².
