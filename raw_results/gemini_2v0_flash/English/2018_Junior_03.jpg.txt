Reasoning:
The triangle inequality states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. Let the third side be x. Therefore, we have the following inequalities:
1. 5 + 2 > x  => 7 > x
2. 5 + x > 2  => x > -3 (This is always true since x must be positive)
3. 2 + x > 5  => x > 3
Combining these inequalities, we have 3 < x < 7. Since the length of the third side must be an odd whole number, the possible values for x are 5.
