Reasoning: We are given that if Alex does not wear a hat, Bob wears a hat, and if Bob does not wear a hat, Carl wears a hat. We also know that Carl does not wear a hat today. Since Carl does not wear a hat, Bob must be wearing a hat because if Bob did not wear a hat, then Carl would be wearing a hat, which contradicts the given information. So Bob is wearing a hat. Since Bob is wearing a hat, it must be the case that Alex is also wearing a hat. Otherwise if Alex did not wear a hat, Bob would be wearing a hat. Since Bob is wearing a hat, we cannot say anything about Alex's hat.

Because Carl does not wear a hat today, Bob *must* be wearing a hat. If Bob does not wear a hat, Carl *must* wear a hat. Since Carl is not wearing a hat, Bob *must* wear a hat. Now we know Bob is wearing a hat.
If Alex doesn't wear a hat, Bob does. Since Bob is wearing a hat, it is impossible for Alex not to wear a hat.
If Alex *does* wear a hat, this satisfies the conditions. Therefore, Alex is wearing a hat.
So both Alex and Bob are wearing a hat.
