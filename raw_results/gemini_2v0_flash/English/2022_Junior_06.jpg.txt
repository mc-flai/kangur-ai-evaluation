Reasoning:
Let the number be $x$. The given condition is that $x + x^2 = 0$. This can be factored as $x(1+x) = 0$, which gives two possible solutions for $x$: $x=0$ or $x=-1$.
The question also says the number is smaller than its half and bigger than its double. Let's consider $x=0$. Half of $x$ is $0/2 = 0$, and double of $x$ is $2*0 = 0$. So, $x=0$ is not smaller than its half nor bigger than its double. Therefore, $x=0$ is not the answer.
Now consider $x=-1$. Half of $x$ is $-1/2$, and double of $x$ is $2*(-1) = -2$. Since $-1 < -1/2$ and $-1 > -2$, $x=-1$ satisfies the conditions.
