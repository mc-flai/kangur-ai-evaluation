Reasoning:
Let $G, W, L$ be the number of goats, wolves, and lions, respectively. Initially, we have $G = 17, W = 55, L = 6$.
The transformations are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Wolf eats a goat: Wolf $\to$ Lion, Goat $\to$ 0. So, $W \to W - 1, G \to G - 1, L \to L + 1$. The total number of animals decreases by 1.
    \item Lion eats a goat: Lion $\to$ Wolf, Goat $\to$ 0. So, $L \to L - 1, G \to G - 1, W \to W + 1$. The total number of animals decreases by 1.
    \item Lion eats a wolf: Lion $\to$ Goat, Wolf $\to$ 0. So, $L \to L - 1, W \to W - 1, G \to G + 1$. The total number of animals decreases by 1.
\end{itemize}
Regardless of the eating, the total number of animals decreases after each eating. Thus, we want to find the minimum number of animals possible.

Let us consider the case where only lions are left. This happens when the wolves and goats have all been eaten. This would mean a total of $17 + 55 = 72$ animals need to be eaten.  This means we would have a final count of $6 + 17 + 55 - 72 = 6 + 0 + 0 = 6$.

If we wanted only wolves, we would need to eat the goats and lions. This means $17 + 6 = 23$ animals need to be eaten. The number of remaining animals would be $55 + 17 + 6 - 23 = 55$.
If we wanted only goats, we would need to eat the lions and wolves. This means $6 + 55 = 61$ animals need to be eaten. The number of remaining animals would be $17 + 6 + 55 - 61 = 17$.

Now consider the case where goats and wolves are eaten by the lions until the lions are gone. Suppose the total number of animals is $N = 17 + 55 + 6 = 78$.  We are looking for a scenario where eating is no longer possible.

Consider the expression $|L - W|$. In order to stop the eating, we can either have just one kind of animal, or have two kinds of animals with no one willing to eat.
If $G = 0$, $W = 0$, then $L = 6$.
If $L = 0$, $W = 0$, then $G = 17$.
If $G = 0$, $L = 0$, then $W = 55$.
We need to find the minimum number of animals that can still be on the island.
Since any animal can be eaten, we need to look for the minimal number of animals.  
If wolves eat goats, then wolf becomes lion.  So if 17 goats are eaten, 17 wolves become lions.
The result is $G=0, W = 55-17=38, L = 6+17 = 23$.  Total: $23 + 38 = 61$.
Let the lions eat the wolves. Then lion becomes goat.  So if 23 wolves are eaten, 23 lions become goats.
The result is $G=0, W = 38 - x, L = 23$.  $x=38, W = 0$. Total: $23 + 0 = 23$
If wolves eat goats: W->L
Lions eat wolves: L->G
Lions eat goats: L->W
If $G = W$, then $G = 0$.
Remaining: $L = 6+17 = 23$.
So $G=0$, $L=x+6, W=y+55$. Also, $x = 17$.

Suppose $L$ eat all $G$. We can make $G=0$. $L + G + W - G = L + W$. $L$ is the smallest and must increase.
If all animals have the same amount $78/3 \approx 26$. $W+L+G = N$. If no eating happens $L>0,W>0,G>0$.

If all but one kind of animal are gone. We are looking for the minimum total number of animals left.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1}$
Reasoning:
The question asks for the *maximum* number of animals that can still be on the island after some time when no more eating is possible. This implies that we want to find a stable state where no animal can eat any other. This is only possible if only one type of animal is left. Since we want to maximize the number of animals, we want to leave as many of the most populous animal type, which is Wolves with 55.
However, the rules specify that when a wolf eats a goat, the wolf becomes a lion. This doesn't help us to achieve all wolves.
Similarly a lion eating a wolf results in a Goat.
Initially:
Goats = 17
Wolves = 55
Lions = 6

We can have all Lions only.
If Lions eat all Goats, the lions become Wolves.
To remove Goats, we have to remove $17$ animals from the system.

$17+55+6=78$.

Final Answer: The total number of animals must go down until no more eating is possible. The greatest value possible for this would be $35$.
If wolves ate all 17 goats, then wolves-17 became lions. $17 + 55 + 6 \to 0 + 38 + 23 = 61$.
If now lions eat 23 wolves then lions - 23 change into goats. $0 + 38 + 23 \to 23 + 15 + 0 = 38$.
After each animal eating, the population is decreasing in number until the last one and possibly, they only have 1 animal left. If all the wolves die and turn to lion. Eventually there will only be 1 lion remaining.
If we suppose that all lions are removed. and then only one type of animals and max number of animals on the island.

If there's $L>0$ $W>0$, this becomes impossible since wolves will be able to be eaten by the Lions. Also, goeats will be eaten by Lions and Wolves. Therefore the solution can not have $G$,$L$, $W$.

The maximum amount is such that no eating happens.
Only option A is a possible minimal number of animals.
Reasoning: The question is asking the *maximum* amount of animals left.

The problem is poorly written and does not consider that the lion eats, then it goes. Lion eats and leaves.
So, each eat removes from population. And at the end no eating is possible.

The only logical answer is 1.
Reasoning:
The prompt asks for the *maximum* amount of animals. The number of animals can change as animals eat each other and transform into other animals. However, with each eating interaction the total population decreases. So we wish to reduce to the largest number of animals of a *single* type.

Let $l, w, g$ represent the number of lions, wolves and goats, respectively.
Wolves eat goats: $(g, w, l) \to (g-1, w-1, l+1)$
Lions eat goats: $(g, w, l) \to (g-1, w+1, l-1)$
Lions eat wolves: $(g, w, l) \to (g+1, w-1, l-1)$

We begin with (17, 55, 6).
Try to maximize the wolves: Have lions eat goats: (16, 56, 5). Continue until (0, 17+55, 6-17) impossible.
Try to get rid of goats, then wolves.

If there can only be one kind of animal at the end, we are asking which one type would result in maximum remaining numbers. If wolves were the one remaining, it could not be 55. This can't be answered with the constraints and thus should only be 1.
Answer: A)
Reasoning:
The question asks for the MAXIMUM number of animals.
After eating there should be NO more eating possible. That means only one type of animal remains
There is no information about dying or natural birth. The total number of animals after eating MUST reduce.
If there is more than one animal at the end no eating must be possible. That will violate previous rule
The only option possible is just ONE animal should be present at the end
Answer: A)
Reasoning:
The problem states, "After some time no more eating is possible." That means one type of animal is the only remaining animal and it is asking the "maximum amount of animals". Lions can eat both wolves and goats and the transformation would not terminate. Wolves can eat goats and the transformation would not terminate.
So there should be only one animal at the end
Therefore the answer must be (A).

Answer: A)
