Reasoning:
The problem states that Ana lights a candle every 10 minutes and each candle lasts 40 minutes. We need to find out how many candles are lit after 55 minutes.
- At 10 minutes, the first candle is lit.
- At 20 minutes, the second candle is lit.
- At 30 minutes, the third candle is lit.
- At 40 minutes, the fourth candle is lit.
- At 50 minutes, the fifth candle is lit.
- At 55 minutes, 5 candles have been lit.
However, the first candle is only lit for 40 minutes, so it will no longer be lit after 40 minutes. The second candle is lit after 50 minutes and will not have burned out until 60 minutes. The third candle is lit after 30 minutes and will burn out after 70 minutes.
Since after 55 minutes:
- The first candle will burn out at 10+40=50 minutes.
- The second candle will burn out at 20+40=60 minutes.
- The third candle will burn out at 30+40=70 minutes.
- The fourth candle will burn out at 40+40=80 minutes.
- The fifth candle will burn out at 50+40=90 minutes.
Since 55 minutes is between 50 and 60 minutes, after 55 minutes, only the last four (2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th) candles will be lit. The first one will have burned out.
This is wrong.

Let's calculate it this way. After 55 minutes:
- The first candle (lit at 10 minutes) has been burning for 45 minutes. Since each candle lasts 40 minutes, it has burned out.
- The second candle (lit at 20 minutes) has been burning for 35 minutes. It's still lit.
- The third candle (lit at 30 minutes) has been burning for 25 minutes. It's still lit.
- The fourth candle (lit at 40 minutes) has been burning for 15 minutes. It's still lit.
- The fifth candle (lit at 50 minutes) has been burning for 5 minutes. It's still lit.
So there are 4 candles lit. Nope still off.

Let's calculate this again.
Candle 1 lit at 10 minutes: at 55 minutes, it has been burning for 45 minutes. It has burned out.
Candle 2 lit at 20 minutes: at 55 minutes, it has been burning for 35 minutes. It is lit.
Candle 3 lit at 30 minutes: at 55 minutes, it has been burning for 25 minutes. It is lit.
Candle 4 lit at 40 minutes: at 55 minutes, it has been burning for 15 minutes. It is lit.
Candle 5 lit at 50 minutes: at 55 minutes, it has been burning for 5 minutes. It is lit.

So 4 candles are lit at 55 minutes.

Reasoning: Ana lights a candle every 10 minutes, and each candle lasts 40 minutes. We need to calculate how many candles are still lit at 55 minutes.
Candle 1: Lit at 10, burns out at 50. At 55, it is out.
Candle 2: Lit at 20, burns out at 60. At 55, it is lit.
Candle 3: Lit at 30, burns out at 70. At 55, it is lit.
Candle 4: Lit at 40, burns out at 80. At 55, it is lit.
Candle 5: Lit at 50, burns out at 90. At 55, it is lit.

Therefore, 4 candles are lit.
