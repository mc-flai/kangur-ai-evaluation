Reasoning:
Initially, Luis has 7 apples and 2 bananas.
He gives 2 apples, so he has 7-2 = 5 apples.
Let x be the number of bananas he gets from Jacob.
After receiving the bananas, he has 2 + x bananas.
According to the question, the number of apples is equal to the number of bananas.
Thus, 5 = 2 + x
x = 5 - 2
x = 3
So, Luis gets 3 bananas from Jacob.

Answer: B)
