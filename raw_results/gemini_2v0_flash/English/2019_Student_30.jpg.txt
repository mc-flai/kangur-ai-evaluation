Reasoning: The three black-bordered sections consist of one, three and one cell respectively. Let the numbers in these sections be $x, y, z$. The first section has value 2. The second section contains the value 2 in the last row. So, the column containing the first section is $2, a, b, c, d$. The column containing the third section is $e, f, g, h, i$. In the first row, the value for the third section is the unknown value, say, $X$. Therefore, the values in each row and column are 1,2,3,4,5. In the last row, the value for the first section is 2. In the second column, the value will be $a,f,g,h,i$, where a could be any number except 2. Since the sum of numbers in the three sections are the same, $2 = 2 + y + X$. The possible sums for numbers 1,2,3,4,5 are $1+2+3+4+5=15$. The sum of the values of the first section is 2. The sum of the values of the second section is $y$. The sum of the values of the third section is $X$. Each row sums to 15. Each column sums to 15. The first column contains 2, so the others are 1,3,4,5 in some order. The first row must contain 1,3,4,5 in some order with $X$. The total sum should be the same in each row and column, so $2 + y = X$. There are five possible values for X, which are 1,2,3,4,5. Then, $x+y = constant$, so each has the same value. The black borders consist of sizes 1,3 and 1. Since 2 is fixed, that makes the first border value 2. Now, $2 + second value =  X$, so $X = 2 + second value$. Since 2 can occur only once, the first row must have either 1,3,4,5 and the first column cannot be 2, and so must contain 1,3,4,5. However the number $X$ can only occupy the first row and the fifth column. The only way we can proceed is $2 + 3 = 5$, where the second black bordered value is 3, and then the answer is X=5.
Reasoning: Since the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 must appear once in each row and each column, and the sum of the numbers in the three black-bordered sections must be the same, we can use the constraints from the partial placement to narrow down the possibilities.
Since the cell at the bottom-left contains 2, this cell constitutes one of the black bordered sections. Let the sum of the numbers in each of the three black-bordered sections be $S$. Then, one of the sections has a number 2. So, $S = 2$.
We need to find the number in the top-right corner, which is part of another black-bordered section. Let this number be $x$. If this is also equal to $S$, then $S = x$.
The third black-bordered section consists of 3 cells. We have $2 + x =$ Sum of this section (containing 3 cells)
The number $S$ represents this same sum, so it will determine the $2 + x = S$, with the constraints that each column and each row should have numbers 1 to 5 once. So, the value $S = sum/3 = constant.
Since the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 appear once in each row and column, the sum 2 + y + X = same constant, where value = S
From our knowledge, $x + 2 =$ the sum.
If $X=5$, then $y =3$, then 2,3 and 5, the total =10. $10/3 = 3.33
If $X = number + y = S$, where 'number' = 2. So, consider X= 5 = number +y =2 +y. So, y= 3.
Reasoning: The border sections must have the same sum. We already know the bottom left is 2.
If the top right is 1, then the middle 3 section must also sum to 1, which is impossible with the numbers 1,2,3,4,5.
If the top right is 2, then the middle 3 section must also sum to 2, which is impossible.
If the top right is 3, then the middle 3 section must also sum to 3, which is impossible with 2 present in the same row.
If the top right is 4, then the middle 3 section must also sum to 4. One of the cells is in the same row as 2, and they can only appear once, then numbers can be only 1, and 1, which does not make 4, which is incorrect.
If the top right is 5, then the middle 3 section must also sum to 5, and none of these is in the same row as 2. Consider 1,2,2 not permissible, try 1,1,3 not permissible, try 1,2? then 1.2+0 will not create five, use 2 and, and 3, try for one spot
2, +1,2 then two spots could add.
