Reasoning: The two pieces have 7 squares each. One piece has 4 squares in a row, the other is like a backwards L.

A) is possible. The L shape piece can be placed at the top left corner rotated 90 degrees clockwise, the 4 squares fit at the bottom.
B) is possible. The L can be placed at the top left corner, the 4 squares fit at the bottom.
C) is possible.
D) is not possible. If you place the 4 squares horizontally, there are no spaces to fit the other piece. If you put the 4 squares in top or bottom row then there are no possible combination for placing the other figure.
E) is possible.
