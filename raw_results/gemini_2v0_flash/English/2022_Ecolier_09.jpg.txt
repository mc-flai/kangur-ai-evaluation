Reasoning: Let's track the car order.
Initially: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
1. Last car (5) overtakes two in front: 1, 2, 3, 5, 4
2. Second to last car (5) overtakes two in front: 1, 2, 5, 3, 4
3. Middle car (5) overtakes two in front: 1, 5, 2, 3, 4
Therefore, the final order is 1, 5, 2, 3, 4. None of the provided answer options match this order. However, re-reading the problem, the direction of travel is to the LEFT based on the arrow. Therefore, the car list should be read in reverse order.

Initially: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
1. Last car (1) overtakes two in front: 5, 4, 3, 1, 2
2. Second to last car (1) overtakes two in front: 5, 4, 1, 3, 2
3. Middle car (1) overtakes two in front: 5, 1, 4, 3, 2

The correct order should be 2, 3, 4, 1, 5. However, this is still wrong.

Let's re-think the problem.

Initially: 1 2 3 4 5
1. Car 5 overtakes 4 and 3: 1 2 5 4 3
2. Car 4 overtakes 5 and 2: 1 4 5 2 3
3. Car 5 overtakes 4 and 1: 5 4 1 2 3

Thus we have 5, 4, 1, 2, 3 from left to right. However, the driving direction is to the left, thus we reverse it: 3, 2, 1, 4, 5.
But this is not among the given answer either.

Let's follow step-by-step again:
1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> 1, 2, 3, 5, 4  (5 overtakes 4 and 3)
2. 1, 2, 3, 5, 4 -> 1, 2, 5, 3, 4 (5 overtakes 3) since 5 overtakes 3 and 4 so 4 is the 'second last' now.
3. 1, 2, 5, 3, 4 -> 1, 5, 2, 3, 4 (5 overtakes 2 and 1) since 5 overtakes 2 and 3 so 2 is the middle number.

This also leads to the incorrect final car order that is not from the options.

Therefore there's ambiguity regarding the instruction 'Second to last'.
Going by the initial understanding, the car to the immediate left of the last car is defined to be second last.
However, following this method, we have arrived at the final car order that is not from the options.

I'm starting over, treating the problem as a "move two ahead."
1. 1 2 3 4 5 -> 1 2 3 5 4
2. 1 2 3 5 4 -> 1 2 5 3 4
3. The car in the middle is now '5'. So, 1 2 5 3 4 -> 5 1 2 3 4.
So reading right to left (as per driving direction), final is 4 3 2 1 5 which again is not matching.

Since the problem has stated "In the end the car that is now in the middle...", it should be referring to the car after the 2nd overtaking.

The order after the second overtaking is 1, 2, 5, 3, 4. So the middle one is 5.

The instruction is "overtakes the two in front of it".

So the car arrangement becomes 5, 1, 2, 3, 4.
However, we need to reverse the order given the driving direction.

So the answer is 4, 3, 2, 1, 5. Again, no matching answer.

So the original list is not the car position, it is the labeling. This is really ambiguous. I misunderstood the car driving direction in that initial list.
If 5 overtakes two car, it goes to the front (to the left), since that's the direction.
Initially: 1 2 3 4 5
Step 1: 5 1 2 3 4
Step 2: 4 5 1 2 3
Step 3: 1 4 5 2 3
However, there's still ambiguity in that should the 5 pass 3 and 4? or should it go to "third last car over two in front of it" since it has become the 'last' one in the sequence.

Reasoning:
Initially: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
1. Last car (5) overtakes the two cars in front: 5, 1, 2, 3, 4
2. Second to last car (3) overtakes the two cars in front: 3, 5, 1, 2, 4
3. Middle car (5) overtakes the two cars in front: 5, 3, 1, 2, 4
Since the movement is against the list (towards front). We would then read 4, 2, 1, 3, 5.

The correct way to visualize this is.
Initial state = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Step 1. 5 overtakes 4 and 3: New state = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4]
Step 2. 3 overtakes 2 and 5: New state = [1, 3, 2, 5, 4]
Step 3. Middle car now (2) overtakes the 3 and 1: New state = [2, 1, 3, 5, 4]

Answer: C)
Reasoning: The problem describes a series of overtaking maneuvers of five cars labelled 1 to 5. The cars drive to the LEFT.
Initial order: 1 2 3 4 5
1. Car 5 overtakes cars 4 and 3: resulting order: 1 2 5 3 4
2. The second-to-last car, which is now '3', overtakes cars '5' and '2': 1 3 2 5 4
3. The middle car, which is now '2', overtakes cars '3' and '1': 2 1 3 5 4

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Initial state: 1 2 3 4 5
1) 5 overtakes 4 and 3: 1 2 5 3 4
2) 3 overtakes 5 and 2: 1 3 2 5 4
3) Now the middle car which is 2 overtakes 3 and 1 to give: 2 1 3 5 4

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Start: 1 2 3 4 5
1. 5 overtakes 4 and 3:  1 2 5 3 4
2. The "now" second to last car is 3. 3 overtakes 5 and 2: 1 3 2 5 4
3. The car now in the middle is 2. 2 overtakes 3 and 1: 2 1 3 5 4
Therefore, the final order is 2 1 3 5 4.

Answer: (B)
Reasoning: Let's trace the steps carefully. The cars drive to the LEFT.

Initially: 1 2 3 4 5
1. Last car, 5, overtakes the two in front (4 and 3):  1 2 5 3 4
2. Now the "second to last" car is 3.  3 overtakes the two in front (5 and 2): 1 3 2 5 4
3. The "middle" car is now 2. 2 overtakes the two in front (3 and 1): 2 1 3 5 4

Answer: (C)
Reasoning: Let's track the movements of the cars step by step, remembering that "overtaking" means moving to the front (left) in the current context:

1. Initial order: 1 2 3 4 5
2. Car 5 overtakes 4 and 3: 1 2 5 3 4
3. The second-to-last car (3) overtakes 5 and 2: 1 3 2 5 4
4. The middle car (2) overtakes 3 and 1: 2 1 3 5 4

Answer: (C)

1. Starting order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2. Car 5 overtakes 4 and 3: 1, 2, 5, 3, 4
3. The second to last car (3) overtakes 5 and 2: 1, 3, 2, 5, 4
4. Now, the middle car (2) overtakes 3 and 1: 2, 1, 3, 5, 4

Answer: (C)
Reasoning: The question asks for the order of cars after some overtaking moves.
Initial order: 1 2 3 4 5.
1. The last car '5' overtakes two cars in front. So, the order becomes 1 2 5 3 4.
2. The second to last car (which is now '3') overtakes two in front. So, the order becomes 1 3 2 5 4.
3. Now the car that is in the middle is '2'. So, '2' overtakes two in front. Hence the final order becomes 2 1 3 5 4.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: I will follow the overtaking steps. Initially, the order is 1 2 3 4 5.
1. The last car, 5, overtakes 4 and 3, so the order becomes 1 2 5 3 4.
2. The new second-to-last car is 3. It overtakes 5 and 2, so the order becomes 1 3 2 5 4.
3. Now the middle car is 2. It overtakes 3 and 1, so the order becomes 2 1 3 5 4.

Answer: (C)
Reasoning:
Start: 1 2 3 4 5

After 1st Overtake (5): 1 2 5 3 4
After 2nd Overtake (3): 1 3 2 5 4
After 3rd Overtake (2): 2 1 3 5 4

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Going through the steps, 1 2 3 4 5 initially. Then,
*5* overtakes the 4 and the 3 ->  1 2 *5* 3 4
then 3 overtakes the 5 and the 2 -> 1 *3* 2 *5* 4
finally 2 overtakes the 3 and the 1 -> *2* 1 3 *5* 4

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Step by step,
1. Starting state: 1 2 3 4 5
2. 5 overtakes 3 and 4: 1 2 5 3 4
3. 3 overtakes 2 and 5: 1 3 2 5 4
4. 2 overtakes 1 and 3: 2 1 3 5 4

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let's follow the cars as they overtake:
Initial: 1 2 3 4 5
1) 5 overtakes 4, 3: 1 2 5 3 4
2) Now 3 overtakes 5, 2: 1 3 2 5 4
3) And 2 overtakes 3, 1: 2 1 3 5 4

Answer: C)
Reasoning:

Initial order = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
5 overtakes 4 and 3 = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4]
3 overtakes 5 and 2 = [1, 3, 2, 5, 4]
2 overtakes 3 and 1 = [2, 1, 3, 5, 4]

Answer: C)
Reasoning: By following the three steps
