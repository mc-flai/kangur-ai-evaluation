Reasoning:
First, calculate the total length of the playlist: 3 mins + 2 mins 30 s + 2 mins + 1 min 30 s + 4 mins = 13 mins.
One hour is equal to 60 minutes. Divide 60 by 13 to find out how many times the playlist loops: 60 / 13 = 4.615... So, the playlist loops 4 full times, and then there's a remainder of 0.615 * 13 = 8 minutes approximately.
Since Song C was playing when Andy left, after 4 loops, Song C will start playing again. The remaining 8 minutes of play-time corresponds to the following durations of the songs: Song C (2 mins) + Song D (1 min 30 s) + Song E (4 mins) = 7 mins 30s. So, at the return Andy is listening song A.
