Reasoning: The building block turns in a sequence of four positions and after every fourth turn it is back to the first position. Since Alfred turns his building block 10 times, the final position is similar to the position after the second turn, because 10 divided by 4 gives 2 with remainder 2.
Comparing the second turn with the options, we can see that the closest option is (B).

Answer: B)
