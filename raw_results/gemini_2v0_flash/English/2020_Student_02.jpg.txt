Reasoning:
The ant initially walks 6m from A to B. When the cylinder is introduced, the ant has to climb up the cylinder, walk along the top, and then climb down. The height of the cylinder is 1 meter. The radius of the cylinder is not directly given, but we can infer it from the fact that the height is 1 meter. However, the picture seems to indicate that the ant walks directly from point A to the cylinder, climbs up, walks directly along the top of the cylinder, and then descends to reach point B as directly as possible. This indicates that the ant traverses a semicircular path on top of the cylinder. The length of the path is half the circumference of a circle. Given that the height of the cylinder is 1m, and the ant goes straight up and down the cylinder, the radius must be 1 m / 2 = 0.5 m (since there are two 1/2 radii when looking at this projection on the cylinder's surface). Therefore, the distance the ant walks on top of the cylinder is π * 0.5 =  π/2 m (half of 2πr where r=0.5). The ant has to go 1 m up the cylinder, traverse  π/2 m across it, and 1 m down. So, the total length the ant has to walk will be some new length of distance before and after the cylinder plus 1+π/2+1.  From the geometry it must be clear that the new length is less than 6 m by how much the cylinder is blocking. If the ant walked on the cylinder it went one up, across the cylinder, then down. It looks like this is half the path of a full circle, and the diameter =1, since the cylinder's height is 1. That makes the curved portion  π * 0.5 = pi/2. The ant goes up 1, then down 1, adding 2 meters to the new path. 6 represents the x distance between A and B. The additional height the cylinder provides is 1.

The ant walked 6 meters on the ground. Now, the ant has to go up one side and down the other. The new distance walked will consist of the initial part from A to the location directly below the top point, plus an additional distance of pi (half the circumference if cylinder had a radius of 1). The distance up and down will be 1 meter each.
However, the diagram shows a path around half the circumference of the circle described by the cylinder. If the path along top of the cylinder is half the circumference of the circle formed by cross-section of the cylinder with 1 meter diameter ( so radius of 0.5), then the added distance due to the curved portion would be pi/2. Then it adds to the total is 1+1+ pi * (0.5) = 2 + pi/2. Now, how did it reduce? So, it walks 6, has to go up 1 and down 1; but at the same time, it takes pi(0.5) route to travel the diameter(1), where the diameter used to be at. The cylinder has a radius. The height will be 1 meters. This means that there has to be another 4 more meters; there may be a slight correction if the diagonal is involved.

The ant is now going up, along and down the cylinder instead of walking that horizontal distance between A and B. The additional distance will be 2 + pi * 1 / 2 = 2 + pi/2 .

Reasoning:
The ant used to walk 6m in a straight line. Now, with the cylinder in place, the ant must walk up 1m, across the top (half circumference, which is pi * r, or pi * 0.5 = pi/2), and down 1m. The horizontal distance covered by the ant's straight walk has not changed. Therefore, the extra distance walked by the ant is 1 (up) + pi/2 (across) + 1 (down) = 2+pi/2, and the remaining distance must be 6-1,5 = 4,5 or 5.
Therefore 8 = 6+1+1+( pi * radius = 1/2) or approximately = 8/5+2 or 8m.

Reasoning:
The ant initially walks 6 m. The cylinder adds to the ant's journey by making it go up and down. The cylinder's height is 1 meter. The additional distance walked is 1 m (up) + 1 m (down) plus the curved distance across the top of the cylinder. Assuming the ant is walking the shortest path along the top, it moves half the circumference across the cylinder's top surface (from one point to another on opposite sides). The diameter of the top surface is 1 meter, so radius=0.5meter. Half the circumference is πr = π * 0.5 = π/2. So the additional distance is 1 + 1 + π/2 = 2 + π/2.  This corresponds to approximately 2 + 1.57 = 3.57. The initial distance was 6. Now the new distance needs to be calculated.

If we considered total straight-line distance, without any extra length due to curvature. The horizontal distances travelled by straight-line and cylinder's diameter is same.

But this option doesn't exist, we cannot select anything from A to E. I can only say if it did the radius = 1 m/2, the curved section becomes = 0.5pi. Total new path = original straight path + 1 (Up) +1 (Down) + radius is 0.5pi = 6 m + 2 + 0.5pi. = 8+0.5 Pi = which is not an option..
There must be something missing.
But 8 could be correct answer.
