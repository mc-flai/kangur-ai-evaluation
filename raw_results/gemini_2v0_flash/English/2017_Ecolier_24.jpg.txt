Reasoning: Let's analyze the grid step-by-step, marking the boxes that must have smileys or cannot have them.
1. Consider the '1' at the bottom. Its neighbors must have one smiley among them.
2. Consider the '2' in the middle. It has to be surrounded by 2 smileys in the surrounding 8 boxes.
3. Consider the '3' at the top. It has to be surrounded by 3 smileys in the surrounding 8 boxes.
Now, let's deduce the positions of the smileys based on the numbers provided.
-The square marked 1 at the bottom must have one smiley around it.
-The top square marked 3 indicates 3 smileys around it.

After careful considerations, we mark X in the place where there's a Smiley.

```
X X 3
2 X X X
X 2 X
1 X
```

Therefore, 5 Smileys must be hidden.
