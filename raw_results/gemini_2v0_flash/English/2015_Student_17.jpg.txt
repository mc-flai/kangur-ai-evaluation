Reasoning:
Let $A$ be the population of Arnberg 20 years ago and $B$ be the population of Berghausen 20 years ago.
The population of Arnberg increased by 40%, so the current population is $1.4A$.
The population of Berghausen increased by 60%, so the current population is $1.6B$.
The total population increased by 54%, so $1.4A + 1.6B = 1.54(A+B)$.
$1.4A + 1.6B = 1.54A + 1.54B$
$1.6B - 1.54B = 1.54A - 1.4A$
$0.06B = 0.14A$
$\frac{A}{B} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} = \frac{6}{14} = \frac{3}{7}$
So the ratio of the populations 20 years ago was 3:7.
