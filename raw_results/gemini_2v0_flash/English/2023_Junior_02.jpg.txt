Reasoning:
Maria first runs (high speed). Then, she takes the underground (high speed), which involves two stops (two periods of zero speed). Finally, she walks (low speed). The graph should have one high speed section, two high speed sections with zero speed in between, and a final low speed section.
A) Maria runs, then moves at moderate speed, and then moves again at high speed. This does not fit.
B) High speed, two stops (zero speed), followed by slow speed fits the description.
C) Constant high speed, followed by decreasing speed. This does not fit.
D) Immediate high speed, two high speed, two stops, does not fit.
E) Low speed, high speed, two stops, high speed, low speed. Does not fit.
B seems to be the best answer.

Answer: B)
