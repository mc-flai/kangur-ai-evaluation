Reasoning: Let's analyze the given options:
*   The probability of rolling a 1 is 1/2, which means there should be 3 faces with 1 dot.
*   The probability of rolling a 2 is 1/3, which means there should be 2 faces with 2 dots.
*   The probability of rolling a 3 is 1/6, which means there should be 1 face with 3 dots.

Now we can examine the visible faces of each die to check if they could possibly be a picture of such die.

A) Shows faces with 1, 2, and 3. No contradiction yet.
B) Shows faces with 1, 2, and 2. No contradiction yet.
C) Shows faces with 2, 3, and 3. Two faces with 3. This cannot be a picture of such a die.
D) Shows faces with 1, 2, and 3. No contradiction yet.
E) Shows faces with 1, 2, and 2. No contradiction yet.

Reasoning:
Option C displays two faces showing '3'. However, as per the probability distribution, there can only be 1 face with 3. Hence, option C is the answer.
Answer: C)
