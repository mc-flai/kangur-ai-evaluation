Reasoning:
The problem states that the product of the father's age and the son's age is 2015. We need to find two integer factors of 2015 such that the father's age is greater than the son's age, and both are reasonable ages.
First, we find the prime factorization of 2015:
2015 = 5 * 13 * 31
The possible pairs of factors are:
1 and 2015 (not reasonable ages)
5 and 403 (not reasonable ages)
13 and 155 (not reasonable ages)
31 and 65 (reasonable ages)
5 * 13 = 65 and 31. This gives us father = 65 and son = 31.
The age gap between the father and the son is 65 - 31 = 34.

Reasoning:
We are given that the product of the father's and son's ages is 2015. We need to find two factors of 2015 that are reasonable ages for a father and son. We found that 65 * 31 = 2015 is a suitable pairing, with the father being 65 years old and the son being 31 years old. The age difference is then 65 - 31 = 34.
