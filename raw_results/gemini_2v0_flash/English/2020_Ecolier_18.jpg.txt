Reasoning:
The 4x4 grid has 16 squares. Removing one square leaves 15 squares. If divided into three equal pieces, each piece must have 15/3 = 5 squares.
A) has 5 squares.
B) has 4 squares.
C) has 5 squares.
D) has 5 squares.
E) has 5 squares.
Now we must see which shape can be tiled to create the original shape. It looks like D might be the answer, but let's try to be sure.
If you look at the missing square in the grid, it's in the bottom right. This could be a clue.
Looking at D, it has the L shape to match the corner.
If you rotate D 90 degrees counter clockwise, and then 180 and then 270, you could tile the original grid by removing the missing square.
So D is the best answer.

Answer: D)
