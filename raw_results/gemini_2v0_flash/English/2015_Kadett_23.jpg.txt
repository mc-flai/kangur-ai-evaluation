Reasoning:
The diagonal is split into segments a, b, c, d, e. From the diagram, we can visually compare the lengths of the segments.
Segment 'a' extends from a vertex to the side of the square. Segment 'b' is part of segment 'a' and part of the diagonal, but does not extend along the side. Segment 'c' is between 'b' and 'd'. Segment 'd' is between 'c' and 'e'. Segment 'e' is also part of the diagonal and ends at a vertex on the square. By comparing the lengths of the segments, it is clear that segment 'e' extends further along the diagonal than all of the other segments.

Answer: E)
