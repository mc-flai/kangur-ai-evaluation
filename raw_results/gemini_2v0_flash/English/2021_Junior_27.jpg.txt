Reasoning: The first column has 2, 0, 2, and 1 black cells.
Rows: 2, 0, 2, and 1 black cells are painted in that order from top to bottom.
I will manually count the possible arrangements.
- Row 2: 2 black cells. ${4 \choose 2} = 6$
- Row 0: 0 black cells, so all white. 1 way
- Row 2: 2 black cells. ${4 \choose 2} = 6$
- Row 1: 1 black cell. ${4 \choose 1} = 4$

The first column must have 2 black cells in total. So let's see some possibilities.
Possibility 1:
Row 1: BBWW
Row 2: WWWW
Row 3: BBWW
Row 4: BWWW
Column 1: 2
Possibility 2:
Row 1: BBWW
Row 2: WWWW
Row 3: WBWB
Row 4: BWWW
Column 1: 2
Possibility 3:
Row 1: BWWB
Row 2: WWWW
Row 3: BBWW
Row 4: BWWW
Column 1: 2
Possibility 4:
Row 1: BWWB
Row 2: WWWW
Row 3: WBWB
Row 4: BWWW
Column 1: 2
Possibility 5:
Row 1: WWBB
Row 2: WWWW
Row 3: BBWW
Row 4: BWWW
Column 1: 2
Possibility 6:
Row 1: WWBB
Row 2: WWWW
Row 3: WBWB
Row 4: BWWW
Column 1: 2

Column constraints
- Column 2: 2
- Column 3: 0
- Column 4: 2
- Column 5: 1
If you were to arrange each row independently, you would multiply the number of combinations which is 6 * 1 * 6 * 4 = 144.
That means the answer would be more than 5.
However, that doesn't take into account the column constraints.

Let's list out cases.

Cases:
1. Rows 1 and 3 have black in the same columns.
2. Rows 1 and 3 have black in different columns.

I can't solve this without much trial and error. It's a combinatorial problem but a very hard one.

Reasoning: Since there are many cases and possible combinations, the answer is likely to be more than 5.
Answer: E)
