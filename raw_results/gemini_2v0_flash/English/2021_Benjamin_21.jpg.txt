Reasoning: Let's consider the given constraints to figure out the arrangement around the round table. We have five people: Ann, Bob, Carina, Dan, and Ed.

1. Ann is not next to Bob.
2. Dan is next to Ed.
3. Bob is not next to Dan.

Let's try to arrange them based on the constraints. Since Dan and Ed are next to each other, we can consider them as a unit (DE or ED). Since Bob cannot be next to Dan, the DE unit cannot have Bob on either side. Also, Ann cannot be next to Bob.

One possible arrangement is: Carina - Ann - Ed - Dan - Bob.
Another possible arrangement is Carina - Bob - Dan - Ed - Ann.

In either case, the constraints hold true:
1. Ann and Bob are not next to each other.
2. Dan is next to Ed.
3. Bob is not next to Dan.

From these arrangements, we can see that Carina is sitting next to Ann and Bob.

Answer: A)
