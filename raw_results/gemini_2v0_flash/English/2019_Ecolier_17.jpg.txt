Reasoning: Let circle = c, star = s, heart = h.
We are given the equations:
c + s + h = 15
c + c + c = 12
s + h + h = 16

From the second equation, 3c = 12, so c = 4.
Substitute c = 4 into the first equation: 4 + s + h = 15, so s + h = 11.
We also have s + 2h = 16.
Subtracting the equation s + h = 11 from s + 2h = 16, we get h = 5.
Substitute h = 5 into s + h = 11, so s + 5 = 11, therefore s = 6.
The star stands for 6.
