To find the number that is an equal distance from $\frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{4}{5}$ on the number line, we need to find the average of these two fractions.
The average is calculated as $\frac{\frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{5}}{2}$.

First, we add the two fractions:
$\frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2 \times 5}{3 \times 5} + \frac{4 \times 3}{5 \times 3} = \frac{10}{15} + \frac{12}{15} = \frac{10+12}{15} = \frac{22}{15}$.

Now, we divide the sum by 2:
$\frac{\frac{22}{15}}{2} = \frac{22}{15} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{22}{30} = \frac{11}{15}$.

The number that is an equal distance from $\frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{4}{5}$ is $\frac{11}{15}$.

Reasoning: The question asks for the midpoint between two fractions on a number line, which is the average of the two fractions. We calculated the average of $\frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{4}{5}$ to find the answer.
