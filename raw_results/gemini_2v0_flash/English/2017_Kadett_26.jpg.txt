Reasoning:
Let's generate the sequence and see if there is a pattern:
2, 3, 6, 8, 8, 4, 2, 8, 6, 8, 8, 4, 2, 8, 6, 8, 8, 4, 2, 8,...
The sequence repeats every 6 terms, starting from the 3rd term. The repeating sequence is 6, 8, 8, 4, 2, 8.
We want to find the 2017th digit of the sequence. Since the first two digits are given, we want to find the (2017 - 2) = 2015th term of the repeating sequence.
To find which term in the repeating sequence corresponds to the 2015th term, we divide 2015 by 6.
2015 รท 6 = 335 with a remainder of 5.
The remainder of 5 means that the 2015th term in the repeating sequence is the 5th term in the repeating sequence, which is 2.
Thus the 2017th term of the sequence is 2.
