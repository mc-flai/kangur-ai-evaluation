Reasoning:
Let the side length of the square be $s$. The area of the square is $s^2$.
The shaded area can be found by subtracting the areas of the two unshaded triangles from the area of the square.
The first unshaded triangle has vertices $P$, $D$, and $R$. Its base $DR$ has length $\frac{1}{2}s$, and its height $DA$ has length $s$. The area of this triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}s \cdot s = \frac{1}{4}s^2$.
The second unshaded triangle has vertices $B$, $C$, and $Q$. Its base $BC$ has length $s$, and its height from $Q$ to $BC$ is $\frac{1}{2}s$. The area of this triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot s \cdot \frac{1}{2}s = \frac{1}{4}s^2$.
The total area of the two unshaded triangles is $\frac{1}{4}s^2 + \frac{1}{4}s^2 = \frac{1}{2}s^2$.
The shaded area is the area of the square minus the total area of the two triangles, which is $s^2 - \frac{1}{2}s^2 = \frac{1}{2}s^2$.
The fraction of the square that is shaded is $\frac{\frac{1}{2}s^2}{s^2} = \frac{1}{2}$.
