Reasoning:
Since a > b > c > 1, the smallest possible values for a, b, and c are 4, 3, and 2, respectively. Let's check some combinations:
- If c = 2, b = 3, and a = 4: 1/4 + 1/3 + 1/2 = 3/12 + 4/12 + 6/12 = 13/12 > 1
- If c = 2, b = 3, and a = 5: 1/5 + 1/3 + 1/2 = 6/30 + 10/30 + 15/30 = 31/30 > 1
- If c = 2, b = 3, and a = 6: 1/6 + 1/3 + 1/2 = 1/6 + 2/6 + 3/6 = 6/6 = 1 (not > 1)
- If c = 2, b = 3, and a > 6, then 1/a + 1/3 + 1/2 < 1
However, we can consider some cases:
(a, b, c)
(4, 3, 2) --> 1/4 + 1/3 + 1/2 = 13/12 > 1
(5, 3, 2) --> 1/5 + 1/3 + 1/2 = 31/30 > 1
(5, 4, 2) --> 1/5 + 1/4 + 1/2 = 29/20 - 1/4 = 20/20+9/20
(5, 4, 3) --> 1/5 + 1/4 + 1/3 = 12/60 + 15/60 + 20/60 = 47/60 < 1

The crucial aspect is to realize that as 'a' increases beyond a certain point, while b and c remain at smaller values, 1/a will get arbitrarily small. Therefore we can find many such cases. For instance, (n, 3, 2) where n > 1, 1/n + 1/3 + 1/2 = 1/n + 5/6 > 1 so 1/n > 1/6 or n < 6. So n can be 4 or 5, hence two options.

Since there is not a limit to the values that the variables can take, and since we've already found two different triples fulfilling the condition, it seems we can find more by tuning the values of a, b, and c, or even find indefinitely many.
