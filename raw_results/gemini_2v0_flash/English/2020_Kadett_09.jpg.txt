Reasoning:
Let the 3x3 grid be represented as follows:
a b c
d e f
g h i
We are given that a = 1, b = 2, c = 6, d = 3. We need to find the value of e.
The sum of each row and column is equal, let's call this sum S.
Then we have:
1 + 2 + 6 = 9 = S.
3 + e + f = 9
1 + 3 + g = 9
2 + e + h = 9
6 + f + i = 9
From 3 + e + f = 9, we get e + f = 6
From 1 + 3 + g = 9, we get g = 5.
From 2 + e + h = 9, we get e + h = 7.
From 6 + f + i = 9, we get f + i = 3.
Since all numbers are distinct, the numbers used are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. Therefore, the remaining numbers to choose from are 4, 7, 8, 9, ...
Also, the possible values for f and i are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
Since f + i = 3, and the numbers must be distinct and greater than 0, possible combinations are {1, 2} and {2, 1}.
If f = 1, i = 2, then e = 6 - f = 6 - 1 = 5.
If f = 2, i = 1, then e = 6 - f = 6 - 2 = 4.
Case 1: e = 5, then h = 7 - e = 7 - 5 = 2. This is not possible since 2 is already used.
Case 2: e = 4, then h = 7 - e = 7 - 4 = 3. This is not possible since 3 is already used.
We have the grid:
1 2 6
3 e f
5 h i
Row 1: 1+2+6 = 9
Col 1: 1+3+5 = 9
So the equal sum is 9.
3 + e + f = 9 => e + f = 6
2 + e + h = 9 => e + h = 7
6 + f + i = 9 => f + i = 3
5 + h + i = 9 => h + i = 4
Possible values for {f, i}: {1, 2} or {2, 1}.
Possible values for {h, i}: {1, 3} or {3, 1}.
Also note that numbers must be distinct, so f, i, h cannot be 1, 2, 3, 5, 6.
If f = 1, then i = 2, e = 5. But since we have 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 used, we need to pick distinct numbers. Then h = 7 - e = 2 which is a duplicate.
If f = 2, then i = 1, e = 4. Here we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, so remaining are {}. H = 7 - e = 3 which is a duplicate.

Let us examine each answer.
If e = 1, this is not allowed as 1 is already in the first row.
If e = 2, this is not allowed as 2 is already in the first row.
If e = 4, then f = 6 - e = 2 and h = 7 - e = 3. Duplicate.
If e = 5, then f = 6 - e = 1 and h = 7 - e = 2. Duplicate.
If e = 6, then f = 0, but the numbers are greater than 0.
Consider this: The numbers already are 1, 2, 3, 6. The remaining numbers must add up to 9 in row 2 and col 2. The only possible combination would be 4 and 5.
If e = 5, then f = 1, h = 2 and i = 6 so, this doesn't work.
Consider S=9
1 2 6
3 5 1
5 2 2
This won't work as we must be distinct. The condition of the same sum is still there
However, let's work the distinct condition
126
3x?
Let's add: 7, 8, 9, 10, ..., this needs to be distinct
Try e = 5. Numbers have to add to 9. 5 is already used.

Reasoning:
Let S be the common sum of rows and columns.  We have 1 + 2 + 6 = 9. Thus, S = 9.  The known numbers are 1, 2, 3, 6.  Let the middle number be x. Then 3 + x + f = 9, which means x + f = 6.  We also need 1 + 3 + g = 9, so g = 5. And we need 2 + x + h = 9, so x + h = 7. Also we need 6 + f + i = 9, so f + i = 3. Finally, g + h + i = 9, so 5 + h + i = 9 and h + i = 4. The values are {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}. We can not repeat these numbers. f and h and i.
If x = 4, f=2, h=3 this duplicate.

Reasoning:

Let x = 5, f= 1. h = 2. Duplicate
