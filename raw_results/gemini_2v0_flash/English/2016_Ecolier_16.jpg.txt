Reasoning:
The game board has 11 spaces. The player places 8 coins on 8 adjacent spaces.
The question asks to find the number of spaces that will definitely be filled no matter where the first coin is placed.

Consider the case where the first coin is placed in space 1. Then the coins will occupy spaces 1 to 8.
Consider the case where the first coin is placed in space 4. Then the coins will occupy spaces 4 to 11.
Consider the case where the first coin is placed in space 5. Then the coins will occupy spaces 5 to 12.
Consider the case where the last placement is with the last coin on space 11. This means that the first coin is on space 4, which means spaces 4 to 11 are occupied.

The range of possible coin placements is as follows:
Start at 1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Start at 2: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Start at 3: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Start at 4: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
The intersection of all these ranges is 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
There are 4 possible positions (1 to 4) to place the first coin so that the 8 adjacent spaces are filled. So, the possible configurations are:
1. 1-8
2. 2-9
3. 3-10
4. 4-11
The common area between these four placement combinations is spaces 4,5,6,7,8. So 5 spaces are always filled.
