Reasoning:
The large square has a side length of 30 cm, and it is divided into 9 equal squares. Each of these smaller squares has a side length of 30/3 = 10 cm. Thus, the area of each small square is 10 * 10 = 100 cm².

There are 5 squares shaded in grey. This has an area of 5 * 100 = 500 cm².

We need to subtract the area of the quarter circle in the bottom right square, which has a radius of 5 cm. The area of this quarter circle is (1/4) * π * (5²) = (25π)/4 cm².
We also need to subtract the area of the full circle on the top left square with radius 4 cm. The area of the circle is π * (4^2) = 16π.
We also need to subtract the area of the full circle on the top right square with radius 3 cm. The area of the circle is π * (3^2) = 9π.
Total area of shaded regions is 500- (25π)/4 - 16π - 9π = 500 - (25π)/4 - 25π = 500 - 25π/4 - 100π/4 = 500 - 125π/4

None of the answer choices match this. Let's consider just the 5 shaded squares. The large circle on the bottom right square has radius 5cm, with area 25π. A quarter of the circle is in the white region so we need to remove that area.
The circle on the top left has radius 4cm, with area 16π. Since it's in the white region, subtract this.
The circle on the top right has radius 3cm, with area 9π. Since it's in the white region, subtract this.
Therefore the shaded area is 500 - (25/4 + 16 + 9)π = 500 - (25/4 + 100/4)π = 500 - (125/4)π.
Again, none of the solutions match. But notice that only one square contains circles, leaving two fully shaded squares plus one half shaded square. This gives us 2 full squares + one half full squares fully shaded. Area of each square is 100. 2.5 * 100 = 250 + 200. Area of the shaded square is 2 squares plus a full square.

Let's look at the bottom left square with radius 5 cm (25π). The area is equal to ¼(π*5²). We need to subtract this area from the 500 cm². Thus:
500 - ¼(π*5²) = 500 - ¼(25π) = 500 - 25π/4. This is none of the given solutions.

Let's analyze answer choice (E) 500-25π. It's not perfect, but probably the closest to the actual answer.

Reasoning: After re-evaluating the problem, let's simplify and focus on the key geometrical areas involved and relate them to the given answer choices.
Area of the big square = 30*30 = 900. Area of each small square = 100. Area of 5 shaded squares = 500.

Bottom right has a quarter circle with area 25π/4 subtracted. The closest value could be when we remove the entire bottom right square of 100 minus the area of ¼ of a circle of radius 5cm. That area is (10^2-1/4π5^2). Area of 5 *10*10 is 500. (E) seems like the most plausible answer because there is shading in 5 squares and circles being subtracted.

Answer: E)
