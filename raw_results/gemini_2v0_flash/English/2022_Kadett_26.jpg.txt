Reasoning:
Let $b$ be the amount of blue paint and $y$ be the amount of yellow paint.
The correct mixture is 2 litres of blue and 3 litres of yellow, for a total of 5 litres. The ratio of blue to yellow is 2:3.

The painter mistakenly used 3 litres of blue and 2 litres of yellow, for a total of 5 litres. The ratio of blue to yellow is 3:2.
Let $x$ be the amount of the incorrect mixture that is kept. Then the amount of blue paint in the mixture is $\frac{3}{5}x$ and the amount of yellow paint is $\frac{2}{5}x$.
Let $a$ be the amount of blue paint added and $c$ be the amount of yellow paint added.
The total amount of green paint should be 5 litres. The correct amount of blue paint is 2 litres and yellow paint is 3 litres.
Thus $\frac{3}{5}x + a = 2$ and $\frac{2}{5}x + c = 3$. Also, $x + a + c = 5$.
Substituting $a = 2 - \frac{3}{5}x$ and $c = 3 - \frac{2}{5}x$ into the third equation, we get $x + (2 - \frac{3}{5}x) + (3 - \frac{2}{5}x) = 5$.
$x + 5 - \frac{5}{5}x = 5$, which simplifies to $x + 5 - x = 5$, which is always true. This doesn't help us find the minimum amount to throw away.

Instead, consider $x$ as the amount to keep such that the ratio of blue to yellow is 2:3 after adding only one colour.
Case 1: Add only yellow paint. Then $\frac{3x/5}{2x/5 + c} = \frac{2}{3}$.
$9x/5 = 4x/5 + 2c \Rightarrow 5x/5 = 2c \Rightarrow x = 2c$.
$x + c = 5$. Then $2c + c = 5$, so $3c=5$, and $c=\frac{5}{3}$.
Then $x = 5 - c = 5 - \frac{5}{3} = \frac{15}{3} - \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3}$. The amount thrown away is $5 - x = 5 - \frac{10}{3} = \frac{15}{3} - \frac{10}{3} = \frac{5}{3}$.
Case 2: Add only blue paint. Then $\frac{3x/5 + a}{2x/5} = \frac{2}{3}$.
$9x/5 + 3a = 4x/5 \Rightarrow 5x/5 + 3a = 0$. $x + 3a = 0$, which is impossible since $x>0$ and $a$ must be non-negative.

Thus, the minimum amount to throw away is $\frac{5}{3}$.

Reasoning: The correct ratio is 2:3 (blue:yellow). The wrong ratio is 3:2 (blue:yellow). Suppose we keep x amount of the wrong mixture. Then we have 3x/5 blue and 2x/5 yellow. If we add yellow, we want 3x/5 / (2x/5 + y) = 2/3, or 9x/5 = 4x/5 + 2y. 5x/5 = 2y, or x = 2y. Since the total must be 5, we have x + y = 5. Substituting, we get 2y + y = 5, so 3y = 5 and y = 5/3. Then x = 10/3. The amount to throw away is 5 - 10/3 = 5/3. If we add blue, (3x/5 + b) / (2x/5) = 2/3, or 9x/5 + 3b = 4x/5. 5x/5 + 3b = 0, so x + 3b = 0, which is not possible.
