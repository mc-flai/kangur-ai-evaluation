Reasoning:
We need to find the first true statement by checking the statements in order.
A) (C) is true: We don't know yet if C is true.
B) (A) is true: We don't know yet if A is true.
C) (E) is false: Statement E is 1+1=2, which is true. Therefore, this statement "E is false" is false.
D) (B) is false: We don't know yet if B is true or false.
E) 1 + 1 = 2: This statement is true.
Since the question asks for the first true statement, we go through the options in order. Option A depends on the truth of C, which we don't know yet. Option B depends on the truth of A, which we don't know yet. Option C says (E) is false, but we know (E) is true since 1+1=2. Option D says (B) is false, which we don't know yet. Option E states that 1+1=2, which is true.

Answer: E)
