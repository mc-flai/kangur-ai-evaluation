Reasoning:
We are given $a_{2n} = a_2 a_n + 1$ and $a_{2n+1} = a_2 a_n - 2$. We also know $a_7 = 2$. We want to find the value of $a_2$.

Since $a_7 = 2$, we look for a value of $n$ such that $2n+1 = 7$, which means $n = 3$.
$a_7 = a_{2(3)+1} = a_2 a_3 - 2$. Thus, $2 = a_2 a_3 - 2$, so $a_2 a_3 = 4$.
Since $a_2 a_3 = 4$, we need to find $a_3$ in terms of $a_2$.

We have $a_3 = a_{2(1)+1} = a_2 a_1 - 2$.
Substitute $a_3 = a_2 a_1 - 2$ into $a_2 a_3 = 4$:
$a_2 (a_2 a_1 - 2) = 4$, so $a_2^2 a_1 - 2 a_2 = 4$.

We also need to express $a_1$ in terms of known quantities. However, let's try another approach.
We can write $a_6 = a_{2(3)} = a_2 a_3 + 1$.
Then $a_3 = a_2 a_1 - 2$.
We know that $a_2 a_3 = 4$. Then $a_3 = 4/a_2$.

We have $a_6 = a_{2(3)} = a_2 a_3 + 1 = a_2(4/a_2) + 1 = 4+1=5$.
Now we need $a_6$ and $a_7$.

$a_6 = 5$, and $a_7 = 2$. We seek a value of $n$ such that $2n=6$. We can let $n=3$. Thus $a_6 = a_{2n} = a_2 a_n + 1$.
Then $5 = a_2 a_3 + 1$, so $a_2 a_3 = 4$.
With $a_7 = a_{2n+1} = a_2 a_n - 2$, with $n=3$, we have $a_7 = a_{2(3)+1} = a_2 a_3 - 2$.
So $2 = a_2 a_3 - 2$. Thus $a_2 a_3 = 4$.

These equations repeat what we have.

Let us assume that $a_2=2$.
If $a_2 = 2$, then $a_2 a_3 = 4$ implies $2 a_3 = 4$, so $a_3 = 2$.
If $a_3 = 2$, then $a_3 = a_2 a_1 - 2$. We get $2 = 2 a_1 - 2$, so $4 = 2 a_1$, so $a_1 = 2$.
But $0 < a_1 < 1$, so $a_2=2$ is impossible.

Let us assume $a_2=4$.
$a_2 a_3 = 4$ gives $4a_3 = 4$, so $a_3=1$.
$a_3 = a_2 a_1 - 2$ gives $1 = 4a_1 - 2$, so $4a_1 = 3$, and $a_1 = 3/4$.
So $0 < a_1 < 1$ is satisfied.

Now we test $a_4$.
$a_4 = a_{2(2)} = a_2 a_2 + 1 = 4(4) + 1 = 17$.
$a_5 = a_{2(2)+1} = a_2 a_2 - 2 = 4(4) - 2 = 14$.
$a_6 = a_{2(3)} = a_2 a_3 + 1 = 4(1) + 1 = 5$.
$a_7 = a_{2(3)+1} = a_2 a_3 - 2 = 4(1) - 2 = 2$.
Thus $a_2=4$ works.

Reasoning: We are given the recursive relations $a_{2n} = a_2 \cdot a_n + 1$ and $a_{2n+1} = a_2 \cdot a_n - 2$, and the value $a_7 = 2$. We seek $a_2$. By trying different values for $a_2$ and computing subsequent terms in the sequence, we found that $a_2=4$ gives a possible value of $a_1 = 3/4$ which is in the correct range $0 < a_1 < 1$.
