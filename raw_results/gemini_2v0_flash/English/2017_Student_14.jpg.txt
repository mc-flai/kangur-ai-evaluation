Reasoning:
We know that the polyhedron has 6 squares.
Each square borders 4 triangles. So, the total number of triangle-square borders is 6 squares * 4 triangles/square = 24 borders.
Also, we know that each triangle borders 3 squares. Let the number of triangles be 't'. Then, the total number of square-triangle borders is t triangles * 3 squares/triangle = 3t borders.
Since each border is counted in both the perspectives, the total number of borders should be equal in both counts. Therefore,
3t = 24
t = 24/3
t = 8
Therefore, the polyhedron has 8 triangles.
