Reasoning:
Let the amount given by the older brother be $x$ and the amount given by the youngest brother be $10$.
The older brother gives him a third of the sum that the two others give him. Therefore, the amount given by the older brother is $x = \frac{1}{3}(F + 10)$, where $F$ is the amount his father gives him.
Also, we know that the father gives him half as much money as his brothers give him jointly.
So, $F = \frac{1}{2}(x+10)$.
Multiplying both sides of this equation by 2 gives $2F = x+10$.
From the first equation, we can express $F$ as $F = 3x-10$.
Now, we can substitute this into the equation $2F = x+10$ to get:
$2(3x-10) = x+10$
$6x - 20 = x+10$
$5x = 30$
$x = 6$
The amount given by the older brother is 6.
Now we can find the amount given by the father:
$F = 3x - 10 = 3(6) - 10 = 18 - 10 = 8$
The amount given by the father is 8.
The total amount is $F + x + 10 = 8 + 6 + 10 = 24$.
Therefore, the book costs 24â‚¬.
