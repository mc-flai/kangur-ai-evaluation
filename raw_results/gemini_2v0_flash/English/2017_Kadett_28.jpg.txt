Reasoning:
Let $v_1$ and $v_2$ be the speeds of the first and second runners respectively.
Since the track is 720m long, we have $v_1 = \frac{720}{4} = 180$ m/min and $v_2 = \frac{720}{5} = 144$ m/min.
Let $t$ be the time it takes for them to meet. Since they are running in opposite directions, the distance they cover combined is 720m. So $v_1 t + v_2 t = 720$.
$(180 + 144)t = 720$
$324 t = 720$
$t = \frac{720}{324} = \frac{20}{9}$ minutes.

We want to find how many meters the second runner runs in between two consecutive meetings. Since the second runner's speed is $v_2 = 144$ m/min, the distance the second runner runs in $t = \frac{20}{9}$ minutes is $d = v_2 t = 144 \times \frac{20}{9} = 16 \times 20 = 320$ meters.
