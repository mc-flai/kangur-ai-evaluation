Reasoning:
The sum of numbers from 1 to 9 is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45.
The sum of all rows and all columns is the sum of all numbers in the 3x3 table taken twice, since each number appears in one row and one column. Therefore, the sum of all rows and columns is 2 * 45 = 90.
We are given 5 sums: 12, 13, 15, 16, 17. Their sum is 12 + 13 + 15 + 16 + 17 = 73.
Let the sixth sum be x. We have 73 + x = 90, so x = 90 - 73 = 17.
