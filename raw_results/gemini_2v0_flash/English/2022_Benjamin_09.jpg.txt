Reasoning:
The square ABCD has sides of 10 cm.
The area of the square ABCD is 10 * 10 = 100 cm^2.
The shaded area consists of 4 identical parts. Each part is a segment of a circle.
The radius of the circle is half the length of the side of the square, so r = 10 / 2 = 5 cm.
The area of the circle is pi * r^2 = pi * 5^2 = 25 * pi.
The total area of the two circles within the square is 2 * 25 * pi = 50 * pi.
If we draw the diagonals of the square, we can see that each of the shaded parts is a segment of a circle formed by subtracting the area of a right isosceles triangle with legs of length 5 from a quarter of the circle.
Let's call the center of the circle O.
Area of a quarter of the circle is (1/4) * pi * r^2 = (1/4) * pi * 5^2 = (25/4) * pi.
Area of the triangle is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 5 * 5 = 25/2 = 12.5.
Area of the shaded part of one segment = (25/4) * pi - 25/2.
There are four identical shaded parts so the total shaded area = 4 * ((25/4) * pi - 25/2) = 25 * pi - 50.
Since pi is approximately 3.14, the shaded area = 25 * 3.14 - 50 = 78.5 - 50 = 28.5 cm^2.
However, there are four shaded regions in the image, so we divide the square into quarters, and each quarter is a segment of the circle. Since the square is 10 cm on a side, its area is 100 cm^2. Each circle has a radius of 5 cm, so the area of one circle is pi * 5^2 = 25 * pi. The area of the two circles is thus 50 * pi. Since each of the four shaded areas are equal, the area of the shaded area is the difference between the square area and the area not shaded. The area that is not shaded is where the two circles overlap in the center, thus the area of the shaded area will be approximately one-half of the area of the square. 100 / 2 = 50 cm^2.
Thus the area of the four equal regions that are shaded equals 100 - (unshaded region). Since the two circles overlap, the answer will be between 40 and 60, closer to 50 than 40.
The area of the square is 10 * 10 = 100. Each circle has a radius of 5 so its area is pi*r^2 = pi * 5^2 = 25*pi. There are 4 shaded segments that combined make the total shaded region. The shaded area appears to be half of the square. 100/2=50 cm^2.
