Reasoning:
Let's analyze the image and the information given to set up equations.
Let L be the volume of a large bottle, M be the volume of a medium bottle, and S be the volume of a small bottle.
From the top shelf, we have 3L + 4S = 64
From the bottom shelf, we have 2L + 2M + 3S = 64
We need to find the value of M.
Let's multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3.
6L + 8S = 128
6L + 6M + 9S = 192
Subtract the first equation from the second:
6L + 6M + 9S - (6L + 8S) = 192 - 128
6M + S = 64
Now, we need to express S in terms of known variables. Let's manipulate the original first equation:
4S = 64 - 3L
S = (64 - 3L) / 4
Substitute this into the equation 6M + S = 64:
6M + (64 - 3L) / 4 = 64
Multiply by 4:
24M + 64 - 3L = 256
24M - 3L = 192
Divide by 3:
8M - L = 64
L = 8M - 64
Now substitute this expression for L into the original first equation:
3L + 4S = 64
3(8M - 64) + 4S = 64
24M - 192 + 4S = 64
4S = 256 - 24M
S = 64 - 6M
Now, let's substitute L = 8M - 64 and S = 64 - 6M into the second equation:
2L + 2M + 3S = 64
2(8M - 64) + 2M + 3(64 - 6M) = 64
16M - 128 + 2M + 192 - 18M = 64
-0M + 64 = 64
0 = 0
Since this does not help to solve for M, let us look at the equation 6M + S = 64 again.
Substitute S = 64 - 6M into 4S = 64 - 3L to obtain
4(64 - 6M) = 64 - 3L
256 - 24M = 64 - 3L
192 = 24M - 3L
64 = 8M - L
Then L = 8M - 64

We could also try some trial and error using the answer choices.
If M = 3 (A), then L = 24 - 64 = -40. This cannot be true.
If M = 6 (B), then L = 48 - 64 = -16. This cannot be true.
If M = 8 (C), then L = 64 - 64 = 0. This cannot be true.
If M = 10 (D), then L = 80 - 64 = 16, and S = 64 - 60 = 4.
Substituting into the equations:
3(16) + 4(4) = 48 + 16 = 64
2(16) + 2(10) + 3(4) = 32 + 20 + 12 = 64
This is a valid solution.
