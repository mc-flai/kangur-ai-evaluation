Reasoning:
The shapes are Heart, Diamond, Club, Spade.
We need to find a five-digit number where the 1st, 4th, and 5th digits are different, the 2nd and 3rd are the same.
A) 34426 - digits are different but 2nd and 3rd digits are the same.
B) 34526 - all digits are different, but 2nd and 3rd digits are NOT the same.
C) 34423 - 1st and 5th digits are same.
D) 34424 - all digits are different, but 2nd and 3rd digits are the same.
E) 32446 - all digits are different, but 2nd and 3rd digits are NOT the same.
In option A and D, we observe that 2nd and 3rd digits are same.
A) 34426 - 1st, 4th and 5th digits are 3,2,6. Different.
D) 34424 - 1st, 4th and 5th digits are 3,2,4. Different.
Also in the options, 4th and 5th digits are different. Thus, D is also incorrect.
Let the digits be represented as follows:
Heart - First digit
Diamond - Second digit
Diamond - Third digit
Club - Fourth digit
Spade - Fifth digit
We are looking for a number where digits represented by the Heart, Club and Spade are different, and the second and third digits, both represented by the Diamond, are the same.
A) 34426 - 3, 4, 4, 2, 6. Satisfies the conditions. So, A is correct.

Answer: A)
