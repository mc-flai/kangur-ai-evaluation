Reasoning:
The double balance tips to the right side after the exchange. Initially, the left side (with 'a' and 'b') was higher than the right side (with 'c' and 'd'). This suggests that 'a' and 'b' were lighter than 'c' and 'd'. To make the balance tip to the other side, we need to exchange a lighter object on the left with a heavier object on the right. By looking at the options, we can analyze each possibility:
- (A) a and b: Switching a and b wouldn't affect the balance at all since they are on the same side.
- (B) b and d: If b and d are switched, and d is heavier than b, the right side becomes heavier, and the left side becomes lighter. This is the correct scenario.
- (C) b and c: If b and c are switched, the situation is similar to the initial one, where the balance has b and the other element on one side, and c and the other element on the other side.
- (D) a and d: Same reasoning as (B) but with a and d.
- (E) a and c: Same reasoning as (C) but with a and c.
Comparing option (B) and (D), we know that 'a' is lighter than 'b', and so exchanging a and d will not result in a major position change of the balance. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer.

Answer: B)
