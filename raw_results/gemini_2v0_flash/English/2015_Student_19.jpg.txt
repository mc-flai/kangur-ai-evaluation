Reasoning:
The problem asks for the number of different colors the marbles have. The marbles are colored based on the sum of their digits. We need to find the minimum and maximum possible sums of the digits of the marbles numbered from 1 to 2015.

The minimum sum of digits is for the number 1, which is 1.
The maximum sum of digits is for the number 1999. However, the numbers in the pipe are only up to 2015. So, let's look at 2015:
The sum of the digits of 2015 is 2 + 0 + 1 + 5 = 8.
Now let's consider 1999. 1+9+9+9 = 28. Also consider 1998, which has a digits sum of 27.  The largest digits sum will occur at 1999 or earlier. Numbers in 2000s are 2000, 2001, 2002, ..., 2015. The digits sums of these numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

Let's check the digits sums of numbers near 2015.
2015 -> 2+0+1+5 = 8
2014 -> 2+0+1+4 = 7
The largest digit sum must be the sum of digits of 1999 (or earlier): 1+9+9+9 = 28.
So the possible digit sums are 1, 2, 3, ..., 28. The number of different colors is the number of possible digit sums.
The possible digit sums range from 1 (for the marble numbered 1) to 28 (for marble numbered 1999 and earlier). Therefore, the total number of different digit sums is 28.
