Reasoning: A quadratic function is parabolic. A, C, and E show a portion of the graph with a negative slope (decreasing). B and D show a portion of the graph with a positive slope (increasing). Therefore, either A, C, and E belongs to one half of the parabola, and B and D the other. However, A, C, and E have negative slopes, while B and D have positive slopes. Thus the parabola has its concavity up or concavity down depending on the order of slopes. Either B and D or A, C, and E will belong to the same side of the vertex of the parabola. Consider the concavity. In the given image, pieces B and D demonstrate an upward concavity while pieces A, C, and E demonstrate a downward concavity. Thus, the graph that does not belong is A, C, or E. However A, C, and E is linear and has negative slope and B and D look like a curve. So graph A is linear. It does not belong. All others do.
