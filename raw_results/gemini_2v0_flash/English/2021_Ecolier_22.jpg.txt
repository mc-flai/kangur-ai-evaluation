Reasoning: Let A be the total weight of apples and B be the total weight of bananas.
We are given that B = 3A.
The total weight of all boxes is 7 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 16 = 36 kg.
Since B = 3A, we also know that A + B = A + 3A = 4A.
So, 4A = 36, which means A = 9.
We need to find which combination of boxes adds up to 9.
(A) 1 and 2: 7 + 5 = 12 (incorrect)
(B) 2 and 3: 5 + 6 = 11 (incorrect)
(C) 2 and 4: 5 + 2 = 7 (incorrect)
(D) 3 and 4: 6 + 2 = 8 (incorrect)
(E) 1 and 4: 7 + 2 = 9 (correct)

Answer: E)
