Reasoning: The large triangle's base is 1+3+1=5 units. The two white triangles at the sides each have a base of 1. Because the shape is symmetrical, the grey area consists of a hexagon with two triangles removed, making the total area of the grey shape equal to the base, 3+1+1 =5.

So the area of the triangle is 1/2*5*h = 5/2h.

The area of the two triangles is 2*(1/2*1*h)= h.

Area grey is 5/2h - h = 3/2h

Area white is h.

Area of triangle 5/2h
Area of grey shape 3/2 h
percentage is (3/2)/(5/2) * 100 = 3/5 * 100 = 60%

If each of the triangles at the sides has a base of 1, and the triangle in the middle has a base of 3, the total base is 5. Thus, the small triangles are each 1/5 the area. Thus the shaded area is 100% - 2*1/5*100% = 100% - 40% = 60%

This question may not be answerable

Since the two white triangles at the sides each have a base of 1, then the base of total triangle will be = 1+3+1 = 5
Area of these white triangles will be the same.
Letâ€™s assume area of one white triangle is 1 unit.
Then the area of triangle with base = 3 will be 3 units.
So total area of unshaded region or area of two triangles is 2 units
So total area of triangle is 2+3 = 5 units
Then shaded region is 3
Fraction of shaded region will be 3/5 = 0.6
Percentage of shaded region will be 0.6*100 = 60%

However, there is another interpretation. Looking from top downwards. The big triangle at the bottom. The left unshaded triangle is 1 unit. The right is 1 unit. The total area of grey triangle will be Area (total triangle) - Area (Left Triangle) - Area (Right Triangle)
So in that case, the total triangle area is 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 units
The total triangle area is 5 units

The grey portion is therefore = (5-1-1)/5 = 3/5 = 60%
Therefore, the correct answer should be 60%. However, this option does not exist.

Reasoning: The total base of the big triangle is 5, and the grey area covers a section of 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 units. Assuming the triangles are all the same height, then the proportion of the area shaded is 3/5 = 60%, and the triangles are all the same height because the angle shown is from a triangle. Since 60% is not an option, the best answer is 'It cannot be calculated'.
