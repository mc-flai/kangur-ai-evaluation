Reasoning: Let the first number be 'x'. Then the subsequent numbers are x+1, x+2, 3(x+2), 3(x+2)+2, and 2(3(x+2)+2) = 6x + 12 + 4 = 6x + 16. We want to find how many of these can be divisible by 3.
x: Could be divisible by 3 (x = 3)
x+1: Could be divisible by 3 (x = 2)
x+2: Could be divisible by 3 (x = 1)
3(x+2): Always divisible by 3
3(x+2)+2: Never divisible by 3 since 3(x+2) is a multiple of 3 and adding 2 makes it 2 more than a multiple of 3.
6x+16: 6x is always divisible by 3. 16 = 3*5 + 1, so 6x+16 is always 1 more than a multiple of 3 and thus never divisible by 3.

Case 1: x = 1. Then the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 9, 11, 22. Divisible by 3: 3, 9. So 2 numbers.
Case 2: x = 2. Then the numbers are 2, 3, 4, 12, 14, 28. Divisible by 3: 3, 12. So 2 numbers.
Case 3: x = 3. Then the numbers are 3, 4, 5, 15, 17, 34. Divisible by 3: 3, 15. So 2 numbers.
Case 4: x = 4. Then the numbers are 4, 5, 6, 18, 20, 40. Divisible by 3: 6, 18. So 2 numbers.

From 3(x+2), we always have at least one number divisible by 3.

Let's assume x is divisible by 3, i.e., x = 3k. Then x+1 = 3k+1, x+2 = 3k+2, 3(x+2) = 3(3k+2) = 9k+6 (divisible by 3), 3(x+2)+2 = 9k+8, 6x+16 = 6(3k)+16 = 18k+16. So here only 3k and 9k+6 are divisible by 3.

Let's assume x+1 is divisible by 3, i.e., x = 3k+2. Then x+2 = 3k+4, 3(x+2) = 3(3k+4) = 9k+12 (divisible by 3), 3(x+2)+2 = 9k+14, 6x+16 = 6(3k+2)+16 = 18k+12+16 = 18k+28. So here 3k+3 (i.e., x+1) and 9k+12 are divisible by 3.

Let's assume x+2 is divisible by 3, i.e., x = 3k+1. Then x+1 = 3k+2, x+2 = 3k+3 (divisible by 3), 3(x+2) = 3(3k+3) = 9k+9 (divisible by 3), 3(x+2)+2 = 9k+11, 6x+16 = 6(3k+1)+16 = 18k+6+16 = 18k+22. So here 3k+3 and 9k+9 are divisible by 3.

In all cases, we can have two numbers divisible by 3. The third number can be x, x+1, or x+2.
Also, 3(x+2) is always divisible by 3. Thus we have either 1 or 2 numbers divisible by 3.

Reasoning: The third number in the sequence is always divisible by 3. Let's try to force one of the others to be divisible by 3. If the first number is divisible by 3, then we have two. If the second number is divisible by 3, we have two. If the third number is divisible by 3, we have two. However, the numbers beyond the third one are not necessarily divisible by 3. The second last number will never be divisible by 3, because it is (a multiple of 3) + 2. Also, the last number, which is 2*(the second to last number) cannot be divisible by 3, since the second to last number is not divisible by 3.
Therefore the number divisible by 3 can either be the third number in the sequence (one divisible by 3), or the first number in the sequence and the third, or the second and the third (two numbers divisible by 3).

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
The third number in the sequence is *always* divisible by 3, since it's the result of multiplying by 3. So there's at least one. Then we must consider the other terms.
Let the first term be $x$. Then the sequence is: $x, x+1, x+2, 3(x+2), 3(x+2)+2, 2(3(x+2)+2) = 6x+16$
We know $3(x+2)$ is always divisible by 3.
If $x$ is divisible by 3, then $x = 3k$ for some integer $k$. So $x+1 = 3k+1$ and $x+2 = 3k+2$. Also, $6x+16 = 18k+16$, which isn't divisible by 3. So in this case we have just $x$ and $3(x+2)$.
If $x+1$ is divisible by 3, then $x+1 = 3k$, so $x = 3k-1$. Then $x+2 = 3k+1$. Again, $6x+16 = 18k-6+16 = 18k+10$, which isn't divisible by 3. In this case, $x+1$ and $3(x+2)$ are divisible by 3.
If $x+2$ is divisible by 3, then $x+2 = 3k$, so $x = 3k-2$. Then $x+1 = 3k-1$. And $6x+16 = 18k-12+16 = 18k+4$, which isn't divisible by 3. In this case $x+2$ and $3(x+2)$ are divisible by 3.
The second to last term, $3(x+2)+2$ is never divisible by 3, as it's always 2 more than a multiple of 3.
The last term, $6x+16$ is also never divisible by 3. $6x$ is always divisible by 3, and $16 = 3(5)+1$, so $6x+16$ is always 1 more than a multiple of 3.
Therefore, there are either 1 or 2 numbers divisible by 3.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
The first number is $x$
Second number is $x+1$
Third number is $x+2$
Fourth number is $3(x+2)$ which is always divisible by 3.
Fifth number is $3(x+2) + 2$ which is never divisible by 3.
Sixth number is $2(3(x+2) + 2) = 6(x+2) + 4 = 6x+16$.  Since $6x$ is divisible by 3, the sixth number can only be divisible by 3 if 16 is divisible by 3, which it is not.

We know that the fourth number is always divisible by 3.  We need to consider if any of the first three are divisible by 3.  It is only possible for one of the first three to be divisible by 3 (or none).
Thus there can be 1 number divisible by 3 or 2.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: The third result will always be divisible by 3 because it is multiplied by 3. The 5th result is never divisible by 3 because it is something multiplied by 3 plus 2. The 6th result is never divisible by 3 because it is a multiple of something multiplied by 3 plus something not divisible by 3. Thus the only other numbers divisible by 3 are the first, second or third, but never more than one.
Answer: C)
Reasoning: The sequence can be represented as: x, x+1, x+2, 3(x+2), 3(x+2) + 2, 2(3(x+2)+2). We are looking for the number of terms divisible by 3. The term 3(x+2) will always be divisible by 3. The other numbers are only divisible by 3 if x, x+1 or x+2 are divisible by 3. At most one of them can be divisible by 3, so at most 2 values are divisible by 3.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: The third circle is always divisible by 3.
So let the first circle be $x$.
The numbers in the circles are: $x, x+1, x+2, 3(x+2), 3(x+2)+2, 2(3(x+2)+2)$

Since only one of $x, x+1, x+2$ can be divisible by 3, at most one of the first three circles is divisible by 3.
Also, $3(x+2)+2$ is never divisible by 3 since $3(x+2)$ is divisible by 3.
Finally, since the previous term is not divisible by 3, neither is $2(3(x+2)+2)$.
Therefore, there is either 1 number or 2 numbers that are divisible by 3.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let the first number be x.
The numbers will be: x, x+1, x+2, 3(x+2), 3(x+2) + 2, 2(3(x+2) + 2)
Only one of x, x+1, x+2 can be divisible by 3.
3(x+2) will always be divisible by 3.
3(x+2) + 2 can never be divisible by 3.
2(3(x+2) + 2) = 6x + 16. Only one number is added, that is not a multiple of 3.
So, either x, x+1 or x+2 are divisible by 3 or not. So, there will be either 1 or 2 divisible by 3.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let the first number be $x$. Then the following numbers are $x+1, x+2, 3(x+2), 3(x+2)+2, 2(3(x+2)+2) = 6x+16$. We know that one of $x, x+1,$ or $x+2$ is divisible by 3. Also, $3(x+2)$ will always be divisible by 3. The other terms, $3(x+2)+2 = 3x+8$ and $6x+16$, are not divisible by 3. Therefore, only 1 or 2 numbers are divisible by 3.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let the number in the first circle be $x$. The numbers in the circles are then: $x$, $x+1$, $x+2$, $3(x+2)$, $3(x+2)+2$, $2(3(x+2)+2)=6x+16$. We want to find how many are divisible by 3.
The term $3(x+2)$ is always divisible by 3.
One of $x, x+1, x+2$ is divisible by 3.
$3(x+2)+2$ is never divisible by 3.
$6x+16$ is never divisible by 3 (because 16 mod 3 is 1).
So there are 1 or 2 terms divisible by 3.
Answer: C)
Reasoning:
Let the first number be $x$. Then the sequence is:
$x$, $x+1$, $x+2$, $3(x+2)$, $3(x+2)+2$, $2(3(x+2)+2) = 6x+16$

We know that $3(x+2)$ is always divisible by 3.
Among $x$, $x+1$, and $x+2$, at most one can be divisible by 3.
$3(x+2) + 2 = 3x+8$. Since 8 mod 3 = 2, this term is never divisible by 3.
$6x+16$. Since 16 mod 3 = 1, this term is never divisible by 3.

Thus, the number of terms divisible by 3 is either 1 or 2.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let x be the first number. The other numbers are x+1, x+2, 3(x+2), 3(x+2)+2, and 2(3(x+2)+2)=6x+16. 3(x+2) will always be divisible by 3. Since x, x+1, and x+2 are consecutive, only one can be divisible by 3. 3(x+2)+2 will never be divisible by 3 since 3(x+2) is divisible by 3. Finally, 6x+16 = 6x+15+1=3(2x+5)+1. 6x+16 can never be divisible by 3. Hence only 1 or 2 can be divisible by 3.
Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let $x$ be the first number. The other numbers are $x+1$, $x+2$, $3(x+2)$, $3(x+2)+2$ and $2(3(x+2)+2)$.

We know $3(x+2)$ is always divisible by 3.
At most, one of $x$, $x+1$ and $x+2$ can be divisible by 3.

$3(x+2)+2$ is never divisible by 3, since it is 2 more than a multiple of 3.
$2(3(x+2)+2) = 6(x+2) + 4 = 6x+16$. Since $6x$ is divisible by 3, this is only divisible by 3 if 16 is divisible by 3, which it is not.

Thus, only 1 or 2 can be divisible by 3.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let the first number be 'a'. Then the sequence of numbers is:
a, a+1, a+2, 3(a+2), 3(a+2) + 2, 2(3(a+2) + 2)

3(a+2) will always be divisible by 3.
One of a, a+1, a+2 will be divisible by 3.
3(a+2) + 2 will never be divisible by 3, as it's always 2 more than a multiple of 3.
2(3(a+2) + 2) = 6(a+2) + 4 = 6a + 16. 6a is divisible by 3, so this number is not divisible by 3.
Hence there are at least 1, and at most 2 numbers divisible by 3.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let the initial number be x. The numbers are x, x+1, x+2, 3(x+2), 3(x+2)+2, 2(3(x+2)+2).
3(x+2) will always be divisible by 3. At most one of x, x+1 and x+2 can be divisible by 3.
Therefore, at least 1 or 2 of the numbers are divisible by 3.
Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let the first number be x.
The numbers are x, x+1, x+2, 3(x+2), 3(x+2)+2, and 2(3(x+2)+2).
3(x+2) will always be divisible by 3.
Only one of x, x+1 and x+2 can be divisible by 3.
3(x+2) + 2 will never be divisible by 3.
The last number is 2(3(x+2)+2)=2(3x+8)=6x+16 which will also never be divisible by 3.
Therefore only one or two numbers can be divisible by 3.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let the first number be x. Then the six numbers are: x, x+1, x+2, 3(x+2), 3(x+2) + 2, 2(3(x+2) + 2). The 4th number, 3(x+2) is always divisible by 3. Of x, x+1, and x+2, at most one is divisible by 3. The other two numbers will not be divisible by 3 because when divided by 3, they will have a remainder of 1 or 2. Finally the last two cannot be because they always result in 2 more than multiple of 3 (last 2). Thus there will be 1 or 2.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let's consider the sequence of operations: +1, +1, *3, +2, *2. Suppose the starting number is $x$. Then the numbers in the circles are $x, x+1, x+2, 3(x+2), 3(x+2)+2, 2[3(x+2)+2]$. The number $3(x+2)$ is always divisible by 3. The only numbers that can be divisible by three are $x$, $x+1$, or $x+2$. Only one of those can be divisible by 3. Therefore, we have either 1 or 2 numbers divisible by 3.
