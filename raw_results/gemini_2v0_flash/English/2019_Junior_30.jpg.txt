Reasoning:
A square number has an even number of each of its prime factors.
The given set is {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90}.
We can write these numbers as:
10 = 2 * 5
20 = 2^2 * 5
30 = 2 * 3 * 5
40 = 2^3 * 5
50 = 2 * 5^2
60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5
70 = 2 * 5 * 7
80 = 2^4 * 5
90 = 2 * 3^2 * 5
Multiplying all these numbers, we get:
2^11 * 3^4 * 5^9 * 7^1
To make the product a square number, each prime factor must have an even exponent.
The powers of 2, 5, and 7 are odd. The power of 3 is even. We need to remove elements such that the powers of 2, 5, and 7 become even.

Consider removing 70. The product becomes 2^10 * 3^4 * 5^8. This is a perfect square. So, removing one element is enough.

Reasoning:
The product of all the numbers is 10*20*30*40*50*60*70*80*90 = 3628800000000 = 2^11 * 3^4 * 5^9 * 7^1
We want to remove the minimum number of elements such that the product of the remaining elements is a perfect square.
In the product 2^11 * 3^4 * 5^9 * 7^1, the exponents of 2, 5, and 7 are odd.
Removing 70 = 2 * 5 * 7 will give us 2^10 * 3^4 * 5^8 which is a perfect square.
Therefore, we need to remove only 1 element.
