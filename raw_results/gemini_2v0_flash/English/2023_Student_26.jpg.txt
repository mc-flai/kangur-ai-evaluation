Reasoning:
The diagram shows a circle inside a square that is divided into four smaller squares.
The circle touches the right side of the large square at the midpoint. The horizontal line passes through the center of the circle and is 8 cm. This means the radius of the circle is 8cm. Thus, the diameter of the circle is 16 cm.
The diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the small square. Since the large square is divided into four equal squares, the side of the large square is twice the side of the small square.
Therefore, the side length of the big square = 2 * 16 = 32 cm. However, the diagram is not drawn to scale and 32 is not in the given options.
Given the circle touches the right side of the square at its midpoint and the horizontal line (which is the radius) is 8cm, it's also given that the height from that line to the top of the little square is 6cm. Therefore, each small square height (and width) is 8+6+6 = 16cm + diameter = 16.
The side length of the big square is twice the side length of the small square. So, side of big square = 2 x 8cm = 16 cm.
The vertical line (radius) is half the length of the side of the small square, thus, radius of circle = 8cm, so the side length of each small square is twice the radius, thus, side length of small square is 16cm.
Thus, the side length of the large square is twice this or 32cm.
My previous approach was incorrect.
If the circle touches the right side of the square at its midpoint, then the side of the small square is equal to the diameter of the circle.  Since we are given the horizontal radius is 8cm, the diameter is 16 cm, so the side of each small square is 16 cm. Then the side of the big square is 2*16cm = 32cm.  However, 32 cm is not an option. Since we are told that the diagram is not to scale, there might be a different interpretation. Let us reconsider the information that the circle touches the midpoint and there is a 6cm distance. The sum 6cm + 8cm = side of the small square. side=14. 14 * 2 = 28 cm
