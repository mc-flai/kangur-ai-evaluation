Reasoning:
The sum of all positive whole numbers from 1 to n is given by the formula S = n(n+1)/2.
We are looking for a prime number p such that p divides S but p does not divide any number from 1 to n. This means p > n. Therefore, n + p > 2n.

We need to find n and p such that p | n(n+1)/2 and p > n.
So n + p is one of the given options: 217, 221, 229, 245, 269.
We can express p = Value - n. Substituting p in p | n(n+1)/2, we get Value - n | n(n+1)/2.

A) 217 = 7 * 31. Let's try p = 31. n = 217 - 31 = 186.
S = 186 * 187 / 2 = 93 * 187 = 93 * 11 * 17 = 3 * 31 * 11 * 17.
Since 31 divides the sum, and 31 > 186 is false, this is incorrect.
B) 221 = 13 * 17. Let's try p = 17. n = 221 - 17 = 204.
S = 204 * 205 / 2 = 102 * 205 = 2 * 3 * 17 * 5 * 41.
Since 17 divides the sum, and 17 > 204 is false, this is incorrect.
Let's try p = 13. n = 221 - 13 = 208.
S = 208 * 209 / 2 = 104 * 209 = 8 * 13 * 11 * 19
Since 13 divides the sum, and 13 > 208 is false, this is incorrect.
C) 229. Since 229 is prime, if we let p = 229, then n = 0, which is not positive.

Consider n = 228, sum = (228 * 229)/2 = 114 * 229. 229 | sum, and p = 229 > 228.
Then n + p = 228 + p. p > n.  We want p | n(n+1)/2 = n(n+1)/2 and p does not divide n.

Let's examine the options.
A) 217 = n + p. n = 217 - p. p cannot divide n. n(n+1)/2 must be divisible by p.
Try p = 109. n = 217 - 109 = 108. n(n+1)/2 = 108(109)/2 = 54 * 109.
Since 109 > 108, p doesn't divide n and divides n(n+1)/2. So 217 = n+p can be possible.

Consider n = 2p - 1. Then n+1 = 2p. S = (2p-1)2p/2 = (2p-1)p.
In this case, p divides the sum, but p cannot be any of the summands, so p > 2p-1 which is 1 > p which is never true.

Consider n = p-1. Sum = (p-1)p/2. p divides the sum but none of summands, so p > p-1.
Let's test C.
229 = n + p, and p > n. If p = 229, n = 0, impossible.
Try p=113. n=116. n+p=116+113=229.
Try p=3. Then we need that n(n+1)/2 is divisible by 3, and n < 3. If n=1, sum is 1, not divisible by 3. If n=2, sum is 3, and 3 divides sum. p = 3 > n = 2. So n+p=5. So let p = 3. Then n = 229-3 = 226.
Consider n = 226. S = (226)(227)/2 = 113 * 227. 3 does not divide this sum.

C) 229. 229 is a prime number. We need n < p. p divides n(n+1)/2, but does not divide any number from 1 to n.

Reasoning: We know that n + p is one of the answer choices. We are looking for a prime p. The sum of numbers from 1 to n = n(n+1)/2. We need a prime p that divides n(n+1)/2 but does not divide any of the summands from 1 to n, meaning p > n.
Start with E, since it seems less likely.
269 = n+p, and p>n. Thus, 2n < n+p. We need to factor the answers to find good candidates for p.

E) Let's look at the numbers from 1 to n and see the prime factors involved.
If n+p = 269, try p=131. n=138. S=138*139/2=69*139. Prime factors of S = 3, 23, 139.
p must be larger than n, 131 > 138 is not true. Also, 131 doesn't divide S.

Try p=137, n=132. S=132*133/2=66*133 = 2*3*11*7*19. 137>132 but 137 doesn't divide S.

Consider 217 = 7 * 31. Let's try p=109. n = 217-109=108. So n = 2^2*3^3. p can't divide n. S = n(n+1)/2. Since p divides S, let's examine the sum.
108*109/2=54*109. Since 109 > 108, and 109 only divides the sum but none of the summands,
this condition is satisfied.

Answer: A)
Reasoning:
Let's try A. n+p = 217. The sum is n(n+1)/2, and p|n(n+1)/2 but p > n. Let's say p = 109. n = 217 - 109 = 108. The sum is n(n+1)/2 = 108*109/2 = 54*109. Since 109 divides the sum, and 109 > 108, and 109 is prime, this is possible.
