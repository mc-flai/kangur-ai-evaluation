Reasoning: After folding the left side over the right side, the top left triangle will overlap the top right triangle and they are congruent. The bottom left triangle will overlap the bottom right triangle, and they are congruent. The circle on the left will overlap the downward pointing arrow on the right and they are not congruent. The arrow on the left will not overlap anything on the right side. Therefore, two symbols on the left side will now be congruent with a symbol on the right side.
