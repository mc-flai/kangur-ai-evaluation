Reasoning:
We need to find how many different positive whole numbers can be formed with exactly 6 matchsticks. Let's look at each digit and its matchstick count:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

Single-digit numbers: 0, 6, and 9 each use 6 matchsticks. That's 3 numbers.

Two-digit numbers: We need combinations of two digits that sum to 6 matchsticks. Since the number must be positive, the first digit cannot be zero.
- 1 (2 matchsticks) plus a digit with 4 matchsticks: 14 and 41. That's 2 numbers.
- 4 (4 matchsticks) plus a digit with 2 matchsticks: We already counted 41 and 14.

So, single digits are 0, 6, 9. Since the question askes about positive whole numbers then we don't consider 0. Then, we have 6 and 9.
Two digit numbers are 14 and 41.
So, in total, we have: 6, 9, 14, 41. Thus, 4 positive whole numbers can be formed.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
We need to identify which digits can be formed with a specific number of matchsticks.
0 needs 6 matchsticks.
1 needs 2 matchsticks.
2 needs 5 matchsticks.
3 needs 5 matchsticks.
4 needs 4 matchsticks.
5 needs 5 matchsticks.
6 needs 6 matchsticks.
7 needs 3 matchsticks.
8 needs 7 matchsticks.
9 needs 6 matchsticks.
Therefore, we can form the numbers:
Single digit numbers:
6 (6 matchsticks)
9 (6 matchsticks)
Two-digit numbers:
14 (2+4 = 6 matchsticks)
41 (4+2 = 6 matchsticks)
There are no other numbers possible.
The positive whole numbers are 6, 9, 14, and 41. There are 4 numbers.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The digits and their corresponding number of matchsticks are:
0 - 6
1 - 2
2 - 5
3 - 5
4 - 4
5 - 5
6 - 6
7 - 3
8 - 7
9 - 6

We want to find positive whole numbers that can be formed with exactly 6 matchsticks.

Single-digit numbers: 0, 6, 9. Since we need positive whole numbers, 0 is not a valid answer. So we have 6 and 9.

Two-digit numbers:
We need two digits whose number of matchsticks add up to 6.
1 and 4 gives us 2+4 = 6. So we have 14 and 41.
Other combinations don't add up to 6.

So the positive whole numbers we can form are 6, 9, 14, 41.
That's 4 numbers.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let's analyze the digits based on the number of matchsticks used.
0 - 6
1 - 2
2 - 5
3 - 5
4 - 4
5 - 5
6 - 6
7 - 3
8 - 7
9 - 6

We want to find how many positive whole numbers can be formed using exactly 6 matchsticks.

Single-digit numbers:
0 (6 matchsticks)
6 (6 matchsticks)
9 (6 matchsticks)
Since we want *positive* whole numbers, 0 is not included, so we have 6 and 9.

Two-digit numbers:
To form a two-digit number, we need two digits whose matchsticks sum to 6.
- 1 (2 matchsticks) and 4 (4 matchsticks): we can make 14 and 41.
- No other combination sums to 6.

So, we have the numbers 6, 9, 14, and 41.
There are 4 positive whole numbers.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Count the matchsticks for each digit:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

Find combinations that total 6 matchsticks:
One-digit numbers: 0, 6, 9.  But 0 is not positive, so we have 6, 9.
Two-digit numbers:
1 (2) + 4 (4) = 6, so 14 and 41 are valid.

So we have the numbers 6, 9, 14, 41.  There are 4 such numbers.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The number of matchsticks for each digit is as follows:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

We are looking for the number of positive whole numbers that can be formed using exactly 6 matchsticks.

One digit numbers: 0, 6, 9. Since we need positive numbers, we have 6 and 9.
Two digit numbers:
The sum of the matchsticks of the two digits should be 6.
Possible pairs are 1 and 4 (2+4 = 6), giving 14 and 41.
Thus the numbers that can be formed are 6, 9, 14, 41. There are 4 of them.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
First, count the number of matchsticks needed for each digit:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

We want to find the number of *positive* whole numbers that can be formed using *exactly* 6 matchsticks.

Single digit numbers: 0, 6, 9. Since we need positive whole numbers, we exclude 0, leaving 6 and 9.

Two-digit numbers: The two digits need to add up to 6 matchsticks.
1 (2 matchsticks) and 4 (4 matchsticks) give us 14 and 41.
No other pair of digits adds up to 6 matchsticks.

So the numbers are 6, 9, 14, and 41. Thus, 4 numbers can be formed.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Count the matchsticks for each number:
0 - 6
1 - 2
2 - 5
3 - 5
4 - 4
5 - 5
6 - 6
7 - 3
8 - 7
9 - 6

We are looking for *positive* numbers that can be formed using 6 matchsticks.

Single digit numbers:
6 - uses 6 matchsticks
9 - uses 6 matchsticks

Two-digit numbers:
1 and 4: 2 + 4 = 6 -> 14 and 41.

Therefore, the possible numbers are 6, 9, 14, and 41. There are 4 of them.

Count matchsticks per digit:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

Positive whole numbers using 6 matchsticks:
Single digit: 0, 6, 9. Excluding 0 since it's not positive, we have 6 and 9.
Two digit:
1 (2 sticks) + 4 (4 sticks) = 6 sticks -> 14 and 41
No other combinations work.

Total numbers: 6, 9, 14, 41. That's 4 numbers.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Count the matchsticks for each digit:

8: 7
9: 6

We are looking for positive whole numbers that use exactly 6 matchsticks.
Single Digit Numbers:
0 (6 matchsticks) - not a positive integer.
6 (6 matchsticks)
9 (6 matchsticks)

Two Digit Numbers:
The total number of matchsticks must be 6.
1 (2 matchsticks) + 4 (4 matchsticks) = 6
So, 14 and 41 are options.
The total number of positive whole numbers is 4 (6, 9, 14, 41)

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
First, count the number of matchsticks used to form each digit:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

We want to know how many *positive* whole numbers can be formed with *exactly* 6 matchsticks.

Single digit numbers: The possible numbers are 0, 6, and 9. Since we need the number to be positive, 0 is not included. So 6 and 9 are options.
Two digit numbers:
1 needs 2 matchsticks. We need a second digit that requires 4 matchsticks. 4 requires 4 matchsticks. So 1 and 4 will form 14 and 41 (2+4=6 matchsticks)
No other combinations of two digits will give us 6 matchsticks in total.

Therefore, the positive whole numbers that can be formed with 6 matchsticks are 6, 9, 14, and 41. There are 4 such numbers.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Count matchsticks for each digit:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

We seek positive whole numbers that use exactly 6 matchsticks.

Single-digit numbers:  0, 6, and 9.  Since the number must be positive, we exclude 0.  So we have 6 and 9.

Two-digit numbers:  We need two digits whose matchstick counts add up to 6.
1 (2 matchsticks) + 4 (4 matchsticks) = 6.  So, we can form 14 and 41.
No other two-digit combination will work.

In total, we can form 4 numbers: 6, 9, 14, and 41.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The number of matchsticks used for each digit is:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

We need to find how many positive whole numbers can be formed using exactly 6 matchsticks.

Single digit numbers that satisfy the condition are 0, 6, and 9. However, 0 is not positive, so the valid single-digit numbers are 6 and 9.

For two digit numbers, the sum of the number of matchsticks needed for the two digits should be 6. The possible pairs are:
1: 2 matchsticks. The other digit has to have 4 matchsticks. 4 uses 4 matchsticks. The two-digit numbers formed are 14 and 41.
The possible numbers are 6, 9, 14, and 41.

There are 4 possible numbers.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
First, we count how many matchsticks each digit uses:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

We want to find out how many different *positive whole numbers* can be formed using exactly 6 matchsticks.

Single-digit numbers: We have 0, 6, and 9. Since we only want *positive* numbers, we exclude 0, leaving us with 6 and 9.

Two-digit numbers: The sum of the matchsticks for the two digits must be 6.
The only combination that gives us 6 is 1 (2 matchsticks) and 4 (4 matchsticks).
The two-digit numbers that we can make are 14 and 41.

In total, we can make 4 different positive whole numbers: 6, 9, 14, and 41.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
First, let's count how many matchsticks each digit uses:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

Now we need to find the number of positive whole numbers which require exactly 6 matchsticks.

Single digit numbers:
0 uses 6 matchsticks. Since we are looking for positive integers, 0 is not included.
6 uses 6 matchsticks.
9 uses 6 matchsticks.
Thus, 6 and 9 can be made with 6 matchsticks each.

Two digit numbers:
We are looking for two digits whose sum is 6.
Since 1 requires 2 matchsticks, and 4 requires 4 matchsticks, the numbers 14 and 41 both use exactly 6 matchsticks (2 + 4 = 6)

Therefore, the numbers are 6, 9, 14, and 41. This is 4 numbers.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
1) Count the number of matchsticks needed to make each digit:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

2) Identify which numbers can be formed with 6 matchsticks. The numbers must be positive whole numbers.
Single digit numbers: 0, 6, 9. Since the number must be positive, only 6 and 9 are valid.
Two digit numbers: The sum of the digits' matchsticks must equal 6. 1 needs 2 matchsticks, and 4 needs 4 matchsticks, therefore the digits 1 and 4 can be used to form two-digit numbers. The possible two-digit numbers are 14 and 41.

3) In conclusion, the valid numbers are 6, 9, 14, 41. There are 4 possible numbers.

6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

We are seeking the number of positive whole numbers that can be made with exactly 6 matchsticks.

One-digit numbers: We have 0, 6, and 9. Since 0 is not positive, the valid numbers are 6 and 9.

Two-digit numbers: We need digits whose matchstick counts sum to 6.
- 1 uses 2 matchsticks, and 4 uses 4 matchsticks. So, 14 and 41 are possible.
No other two-digit combinations result in a total of 6 matchsticks.

Therefore, the positive whole numbers that can be made with 6 matchsticks are 6, 9, 14, and 41.

There are 4 such numbers.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Count matchsticks:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

Find positive whole numbers using exactly 6 matchsticks:

Single-digit:
0: 6 matchsticks - not positive
6: 6 matchsticks
9: 6 matchsticks
So, 6 and 9

Two-digit numbers:
1 (2) + 4 (4) = 6 -> 14 and 41

The numbers are 6, 9, 14, 41. There are 4 numbers.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
First, let's determine the number of matchsticks used for each digit:
0 - 6
1 - 2
2 - 5
3 - 5
4 - 4
5 - 5
6 - 6
7 - 3
8 - 7
9 - 6

Now let's find the positive whole numbers with exactly 6 matchsticks:

One-digit numbers:
0: 6 matchsticks. However, we want *positive* whole numbers, so we cannot include 0.
6: 6 matchsticks.
9: 6 matchsticks.

Two-digit numbers:
Let's see which numbers add up to 6. The only option here is to combine 1 (2 matchsticks) and 4 (4 matchsticks).
This gives us 14 and 41 (both using 6 matchsticks).

In total, we have 4 such numbers: 6, 9, 14, and 41.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
First, let's count how many matchsticks are used for each number:
0 - 6
1 - 2
2 - 5
3 - 5
4 - 4
5 - 5
6 - 6
7 - 3
8 - 7
9 - 6

We want to find how many DIFFERENT *positive* numbers can be made with *exactly* 6 matchsticks.

One digit numbers:
0 (uses 6, but is not positive, so cannot use)
6 (uses 6)
9 (uses 6)
So, 6 and 9 can be formed.

Two digit numbers:
We look for two digits that sum to 6. The only two digits are 1 and 4, as 2+4=6
So, we can make the numbers 14 and 41.

Hence, in total we can form 4 positive whole numbers: 6, 9, 14, 41.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let's analyze how many matchsticks each digit needs:
0 needs 6
1 needs 2
2 needs 5
3 needs 5
4 needs 4
5 needs 5
6 needs 6
7 needs 3
8 needs 7
9 needs 6

Now we need to find the number of positive whole numbers that can be made using exactly 6 matchsticks.
Single digit numbers:
0, 6, 9. But 0 is not a *positive* number. So only 6 and 9 can be formed.
Two digit numbers:
To construct a two-digit number, we need digits whose number of matchsticks adds up to 6.
1 uses 2 matchsticks, and 4 uses 4 matchsticks. So 14 and 41 work.
14 (2+4=6)
41 (4+2=6)

Therefore, there are 4 possibilities: 6, 9, 14, and 41

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Count number of matchsticks:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

Look for numbers with exactly 6 matchsticks:
Single digit positive whole numbers:
- 0 (6, but not positive)
- 6 (6)
- 9 (6)
So 6 and 9

Two digit numbers:
Digits must add up to 6:
- 1 (2) + 4 (4) -> 14, 41

Valid Numbers: 6, 9, 14, 41 -> 4 numbers total

2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

We need to find how many DIFFERENT POSITIVE WHOLE NUMBERS can be formed using EXACTLY 6 matchsticks.

Single-digit numbers:
The possibilities are 0, 6, and 9. But we want *positive* whole numbers, so we exclude 0. We are left with 6 and 9.

Two-digit numbers:
The sum of the matchsticks for the two digits must be 6.
The only digits we can use are 1 and 4 (since 2 + 4 = 6). So, we can form 14 and 41.

In total, we can form 4 numbers: 6, 9, 14, and 41.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Number of matchsticks per digit:
0: 6

2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

We want to find positive whole numbers that can be formed with *exactly 6* matchsticks.

One-digit numbers:
0, 6, 9. 0 isn't positive, so we have 6 and 9.

Two-digit numbers:
The matchstick counts need to add up to 6.
1 (2) + 4 (4) = 6. So we have 14 and 41.

Therefore, the numbers are 6, 9, 14, 41. There are 4 such numbers.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Number of matchsticks:
0: 6

Reasoning:
We must find all positive whole numbers made from digits requiring a total of 6 matchsticks.
Digits and matchsticks:
0 - 6
1 - 2
2 - 5
3 - 5
4 - 4
5 - 5
6 - 6
7 - 3
8 - 7
9 - 6

One-digit numbers that use 6 matchsticks: 0, 6, and 9. Since we want *positive* numbers, we can only use 6 and 9.
Two-digit numbers must use digits with matchsticks summing to 6.
Possible: 1 (2) + 4 (4) = 6. The numbers are 14 and 41.

Total: 6, 9, 14, 41. There are 4 numbers.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let us first note down the number of matchsticks required for each digit:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

We are looking for different positive whole numbers formed by using exactly 6 matchsticks.

Single Digit Numbers:
- 0 needs 6 matchsticks. However, it is not a *positive* integer. So, not considered.
- 6 needs 6 matchsticks.
- 9 needs 6 matchsticks.
So, we can have 6, and 9 as possible numbers.

Two Digit Numbers:
We need digits whose matchstick counts sum up to 6.
Only possible is 1 (which needs 2 matchsticks) + 4 (which needs 4 matchsticks).
So, we can have 14 and 41.

In total, we have 4 numbers which are 6, 9, 14, 41.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
First, we need to count how many matchsticks are needed to create each digit:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

Next, we want to find positive integers that require exactly 6 matchsticks.

For single-digit numbers, we have 0, 6, and 9. However, we are looking for positive integers, so 0 is not a possible answer. Thus we have 6 and 9.
For two-digit numbers, the number of matchsticks need to add up to 6.
1 needs 2 matchsticks, so we need a digit that needs 4 matchsticks. 4 needs 4 matchsticks.
So, we have 14 and 41.

Thus we have 6, 9, 14, and 41. The total is 4 numbers.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The number of matchsticks needed for each digit is:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

We need to form positive integers with 6 matchsticks.

Single-digit numbers:
6 uses 6 matchsticks
9 uses 6 matchsticks

Two-digit numbers:
The matchsticks should add up to 6
1 uses 2 matchsticks
4 uses 4 matchsticks
So we have 14 and 41

Hence, there are 4 numbers: 6, 9, 14, and 41.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let's first determine the matchstick count for each digit:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

Now we want to find the different *positive whole numbers* we can make with exactly 6 matchsticks.

Single digits: We can use 0, 6, or 9. Since we need the number to be *positive*, we can only use 6 or 9.

Two digit numbers: We can use 1 and 4, which is 2 + 4 = 6 matchsticks. This gives us 14 and 41.

So we have 6, 9, 14, and 41. There are 4 total numbers.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
First, determine the number of matchsticks for each digit:
0 = 6
1 = 2
2 = 5
3 = 5
4 = 4
5 = 5
6 = 6
7 = 3
8 = 7
9 = 6

Now, find the positive whole numbers that can be created using exactly 6 matchsticks.

Single-digit numbers:
0, 6, 9 - However, since we are looking for *positive* whole numbers, 0 is not included, so we only have 6 and 9.

Two-digit numbers:
We need two numbers that add up to 6 matchsticks.
1 = 2
4 = 4
The possible numbers are 14 and 41.

So the numbers are 6, 9, 14, and 41. This is 4 numbers.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
First, count the number of matchsticks for each digit:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

We need to find different positive whole numbers that can be formed with exactly 6 matchsticks.

One-digit numbers:
0: 6, not positive
6: 6
9: 6
Therefore, we have 6 and 9 as valid numbers.

Two-digit numbers:
We need two digits whose matchsticks sum to 6.
1 (2) + 4 (4) = 6. So we have 14 and 41.

Hence the numbers are 6, 9, 14, 41. There are 4 numbers.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Count number of matchsticks for each number:
0 = 6
1 = 2
2 = 5
3 = 5
4 = 4
5 = 5
6 = 6
7 = 3
8 = 7
9 = 6

We are looking for positive integers using exactly 6 matchsticks

Single digits:
Since we only want to form *positive* numbers, 0 can not be used (although it needs exactly 6 matchsticks). Therefore, we are left with 6 and 9.

Two digit numbers:
To be used, two numbers must have their matchsticks add up to 6.
1 and 4: 2 + 4 = 6 so 14 and 41 can be formed.

So we have 6, 9, 14, and 41. A total of 4 numbers.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Count the matchsticks needed for each digit:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

Now we need to find the number of *positive whole numbers* formed with *exactly* 6 matchsticks:

Single Digit: 0, 6, 9. 0 is not positive, so we have 6 and 9.
Two Digits:
- 1 (2) + 4 (4) = 6 -> We can form 14 and 41
No other pair can be used.

So there are 4 numbers: 6, 9, 14, 41.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Count the number of matchsticks required for each digit:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

We need to find the number of *positive* numbers that can be formed using exactly 6 matchsticks.

One-digit numbers:
6 can be formed using 6 matchsticks.
9 can be formed using 6 matchsticks.
0 can be formed using 6 matchsticks, but it is not positive.
So we have 6 and 9.

Two-digit numbers:
1 needs 2 matchsticks. We want a two-digit number with a total of 6 matchsticks, so the other digit should take 4 matchsticks.
4 needs 4 matchsticks.
So 14 and 41 are also possible numbers.

The positive numbers are: 6, 9, 14, 41.

Total of 4.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
First, determine the number of matchsticks needed to make each digit:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6
Then find which combinations add up to 6:
One digit: 0, 6, and 9.  Since we are looking for positive numbers, 0 doesn't count, leaving 6 and 9.
Two digits:
1 needs 2, so 4 needs 4.  This gives us 14 and 41.

Therefore, the numbers are 6, 9, 14, 41, which is a total of 4 numbers.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let us count the number of matchsticks for each digit:
0 = 6
1 = 2
2 = 5
3 = 5
4 = 4
5 = 5
6 = 6
7 = 3
8 = 7
9 = 6

Now we have to find how many positive whole numbers can be formed by using exactly 6 matchsticks.

Single digit numbers:
As we can see, the numbers 0, 6 and 9 require 6 matchsticks. But 0 is not a positive number, thus we can use only 6 and 9.

Two digit numbers:
In order to create a two digit number, we need the sum of their matchsticks to be 6.
Only option possible is 1 (needs 2 matchsticks) and 4 (needs 4 matchsticks). Thus we can have 14 and 41.

So in total we have 4 numbers: 6, 9, 14 and 41.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
The number of matchsticks needed to form each digit is:
0: 6
1: 2
2: 5
3: 5
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 3
8: 7
9: 6

We need to find how many different *positive* whole numbers we can form with *exactly 6* matchsticks.

Single-digit numbers:
6 uses 6 matchsticks.
9 uses 6 matchsticks.
0 uses 6 matchsticks. But it's not a positive integer, so we exclude it.
So we have 6 and 9.

Two-digit numbers:
We need digits which add up to 6 matchsticks.
1 requires 2 matchsticks.
4 requires 4 matchsticks.
2 + 4 = 6. So, we have 14 and 41.

Thus, we can form 4 numbers: 6, 9, 14, 41.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
First, we count the number of matchsticks required to make each digit:
0: 6
1:
