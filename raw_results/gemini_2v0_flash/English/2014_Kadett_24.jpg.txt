Reasoning: Let $x$ be the number of questions solved by both Jan and Eva.
Then, the number of questions solved by Jan only is $60-x$, and the number of questions solved by Eva only is $60-x$.
The number of questions solved by both is $x$.
Total points = 312.
For each question solved by both, one person gets 4 points and the other gets 1 point, so a total of 5 points per question.
For each question solved by only Jan, Jan gets 4 points and Eva gets 0 points.
For each question solved by only Eva, Eva gets 4 points and Jan gets 0 points.

$5x + 4(60-x) + 1(60-x) = 312$.
$5x + 4(60-x) + (60-x) = 312$
$5x + 240 - 4x + 60 - x = 312$
$300 = 312$
$5x + (60-x)(4) + (60-x)(1)$
$5x + 240 - 4x + 60 - x = 312$
$5x - 5x + 300 - 5x  = 312$
This is incorrect.
Let x be the number of questions solved by both Jan and Eva. Then, the number of questions solved only by Jan is (60 - x), and the number of questions solved only by Eva is (60 - x). For the x questions solved by both, the first to solve gets 4 points, and the other gets 1 point. So, the total points for these questions is 5x. Some questions are solved by only Jan, in which case Jan gets 4 points. Some are solved by only Eva, in which case Eva gets 4 points.
$5x + (60-x) \cdot 4 = $ Jan + Eva.

There is no way we can do this without some assumptions about who solves them.
Total questions solved is Jan solves 60, Eva solves 60, total 120 answers.
$x$ is the number of same questions.

Let 'a' be the questions only Jan answered
Let 'b' be the questions only Eva answered
Let 'c' be the questions both Jan and Eva answered
$a + c = 60$
$b + c = 60$
$4a + 4c = 312$

$4x+y+4z+w=312$
$x+z = 60$
$x+w=60$
$y = w = 60-x$.
Jan scores $4c + a$.
Eva scores $4x + z$.
$4x+z=60$

Let n = number of questions solved by BOTH.
Then Jan solved (60 - n) questions uniquely. Eva solved (60 - n) questions uniquely.
Total score: 4n + n + 4(60-n) + 4(60-n) = 312

Let $x$ be the number of common solved problems.
Let $y$ be the number of Jan only solved problems.
Let $z$ be the number of Eva only solved problems.
$x+y=60$
$x+z=60$
Total score:
$4x + x + 4(60-x)$

Total score should be:
$ 4y_j +y_e*1 = score$

56 sounds right

Final Answer: D)
Reasoning: Let $x$ be the number of questions solved by both Jan and Eva. The remaining $60-x$ questions were solved only by Jan or only by Eva. Let $j$ be the number of questions solved only by Jan, and $e$ the number of questions solved only by Eva. We have $x + j = 60$ and $x + e = 60$. The total score is $5x + 4j + 4e = 312$ if the problems that each solved separately were gotten correct first by both individuals. Substituting $j=60-x$ and $e=60-x$ into the score gives $5x + 4(60-x) + 4(60-x) = 5x + 240-4x +240 - 4x = 480 - 3x=312$, $3x=168$ and $x=56$.
