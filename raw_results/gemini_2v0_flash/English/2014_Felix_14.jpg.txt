Reasoning: To maximize the sum, we want to make the two numbers as large as possible. We should place the two largest digits (5 and 4) in the tens place, and the remaining digits (3 and 2) in the ones place.

We can arrange the numbers as 53 + 42 = 95 or 52 + 43 = 95.
The possible sums are:
53 + 42 = 95
52 + 43 = 95

The largest possible sum we can make is 95.

Answer: D)
