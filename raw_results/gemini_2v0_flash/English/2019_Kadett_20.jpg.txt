Reasoning: The goal is to find the minimum number of matches. We start with the given match. To minimize matches, we want to use each match for two squares if possible.
1. Start with the given match (1 match used).
2. We must satisfy the "2" in the top left square. The square already has 1 match, so add 1 match on top. Total matches: 1 + 1 = 2.
3. We must satisfy the "2" in the next square, so add 1 match on the left. Total matches: 2+1 = 3.
4. We must satisfy the "1" in the next square; the requirement is already satisfied.
5. Next square has a "0".
6. Next square has a "3". We need 3 matches along the sides of the square. We need to add 3 matches. Total matches = 3+3=6.
7. The bottom left square has "0", the requirement is already satisfied.
8. We must satisfy "3" on the bottom left square. We need 3 matches along the sides of the square. The bottom left corner square requires 3 matches. Total matches = 6+3=9.
9. We now need to connect the end of the chain back to where we started and it has to satisfy the numbers in the squares. 2 + 1(given)=3. Since we start from zero, and go to left of the previous box to the left match, so the box in the bottom now has 3, adding 2 to right side from bottom up. Since we have horizontal matches on side of squares on bottom left, we cannot put them there. So, from zero to two.
2+1+2+3+3+3+2=16.
Looking at the diagram, we must have the following matches to satisfy the numbers:
- First match: 1
- Top left square (2): 1 more match (total: 2)
- Second square in first row (2): 1 more match (total: 3)
- Third square in first row (1): satisfied
- Fourth square in first row (0): satisfied
- Fifth square in first row (3): 3 more matches (total: 6)
- Third row, first square (0): satisfied
- Third row, fourth square (3): 3 more matches (total: 9)
- We must get back to the beginning. 16.

Consider a path that looks something like this.
Matches:
1 to start, 1 to make the first square, 1 to make the second square, 3 to make the fifth square and three on the bottom square, so we can come around with minimal addition.
1+1+1+3+3=9. Plus we can bring it back across to the begin and connect it. It will require 16

Answer: C)
Reasoning: After analyzing the diagram and the constraints, the minimum number of matches required to satisfy the conditions is 16.
Answer: C)
Reasoning: By strategically placing matches along the path, we can satisfy the number of matches needed for each square. Start with 1 match, then add 1 on top for the first square (total 2), then 1 on the side of the next square (total 3). the next ones are satisfied. Add 3 to the last one. We need 3 to bottom left and connect it, resulting in 16.
