Reasoning: The paper is folded along the dotted lines. First, the top two corners are folded down to the center line. Then, the resulting top is folded down again to the center line. Finally, the plane is folded in half along the center line. The hole is made in the last figure. This means that the hole is going through two layers of paper from the last fold. Prior to the last fold, there were no layers of paper, but then it was folded and then a hole was made through both sides where it folded. This means the whole was made at two layers. Now, before the last fold, there are two folds on the paper. Each of the folds is made in a symmetrical fashion, so the whole punches a hole through multiple layers. The final layer before that hole has 2 sheets because of the folding in half down the middle. The sheet before that has 4. This is because each corner has a fold which doubles it. So, the whole ends up being multipled by 2*2*2 or 8 times. If the last two sheets had the holes, then there would be 8 total holes on the sheet after it unfolded.

Answer: (D)
