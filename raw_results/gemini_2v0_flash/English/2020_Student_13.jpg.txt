Reasoning:
Let the surface area of one face of the cube be $a$. Then each cube has a surface area of $6a$. Six cubes have a total surface area of $6 \times 6a = 36a$.
The figure is made up of six cubes, one rectangular block with eight faces that looks like one big cube and one other rectangular block. Assume that by 'eight faces' it means that the area of the surface of each block is equivalent to eight faces of the cube. So one block has a surface area of $8a$ and the other has surface area $8a$.

The total area of the blocks is $36a + 8a + 8a = 52a$.
So $52a$ requires 18 liters of paint.
$a = \frac{18}{52}$.

When the structure is glued, the surfaces that are glued are no longer exposed to the paint.
There are 3 cube faces joined to the rectangular block. And the two rectangular blocks are joined together. So there are $3 + 1 = 4$ faces joined together and unexposed.
Total surface area is $52a$.

Number of faces that are no longer exposed is $4a$.
So the new area that must be painted is $52a - 4a = 48a$.
$48a = 48 \times \frac{18}{52} = 12 \times \frac{18}{13} = \frac{216}{13} \approx 16.615$.
However, based on the description of the structure and the image, we have three small cubes on top of one long rectangular block, and on the bottom, a rectangular block with 3 cubes on one face attached to it. The cubes and rectangular blocks have surface area in the ratio of 3:1. The six cubes have $6 \times 6=36$ faces. Let the number of faces be $n$. The two blocks together look like a block with 8 faces with length $3x$, width $x$, height $x$. so has a surface area of $2(3x^2+x^2+3x^2)=14x^2$. If this structure can be cut up into 8 cubes of $x$ length. $x$ cubes would be $6ax=6x^2 \times 8=48x^2 \approx 16,62$.

Alternatively, consider the hidden area: 3 squares are between cubes and the upper cuboid, and one square is between the cuboids. So 4 squares are hidden. Total area is 52, so visible area is 48.
Then the paint needed is $\frac{48}{52} \times 18 = \frac{12}{13} \times 18 = \frac{216}{13} = 16.615$

The closest option to the correct estimate of 16.615 is 16.0.
