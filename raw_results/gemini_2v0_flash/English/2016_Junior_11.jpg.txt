Reasoning: We can set up the following equations:
1) a + 5 = b^2 - 1
2) a + 5 = c^2 + 3
3) a + 5 = d - 4

From 1) and 2), we have b^2 - 1 = c^2 + 3, so b^2 = c^2 + 4. Since c^2 is non-negative, we know that b^2 > c^2. This means that |b| > |c|.

From 1) and 3), we have a + 5 = d - 4, so a + 9 = d, which means d > a.

From 2) and 3), we have c^2 + 3 = d - 4, so d = c^2 + 7.

Now, let's solve for a, b, c, and d in terms of a single variable. We'll use 'a'.
a = a
d = a + 9
c^2 = a + 2, so c = ±sqrt(a+2)
b^2 = a + 6, so b = ±sqrt(a+6)

We need real numbers. For c to be real, a+2 >= 0, so a >= -2.
For b to be real, a+6 >= 0, so a >= -6.
Since a >= -2, we can safely proceed.

Consider a = -2. Then d = 7, c = 0, b = ±2.
Consider a = 0. Then d = 9, c = ±sqrt(2), b = ±sqrt(6).
d is always a + 9, which will always be larger than a, and larger than c and b.

Reasoning to eliminate other choices:
Let's solve for each variable in terms of the others:
a = b^2 - 6
a = c^2 - 2
a = d - 9
b^2 = c^2 + 4
d = c^2 + 7
b^2 = d - 5
d = b^2 + 5

Since b^2 is always non-negative, d = b^2 + 5 > b.
Since c^2 is always non-negative, d = c^2 + 7 > c.
We know d > a, d > b and d > c. Thus, d is the largest.
