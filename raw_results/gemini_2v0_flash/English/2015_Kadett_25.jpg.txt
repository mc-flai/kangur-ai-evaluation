Reasoning: A cube has 12 edges. Since each edge has length 1, Florian needs a total of 12 cm of wire. The goal is to find the smallest number of wire pieces that can be used to form the cube. We can use the longest wires first to minimize the number of pieces needed.

We can start with the 7 cm wire. That leaves 12 - 7 = 5 cm. Then use the 5 cm wire. That makes 7 + 5 = 12 cm. So we used two pieces.

Answer: B)
