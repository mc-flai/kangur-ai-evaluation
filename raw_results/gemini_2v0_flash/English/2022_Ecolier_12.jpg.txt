Reasoning:
The diagram shows one corner of the carpet. Along one edge, there are 3 rows of 3 dots, so the total number of dots in one edge is 3 + 3 = 6 dots.
The carpet is square, so each edge has the same number of dots which is 6. Since there are four edges, we could simply multiply 6 x 4 = 24. However, we have counted the dots at the corners twice. Since a square has four corners, and each corner dot was counted twice, we need to take care of the double counting. Each side has 6 dots, so all four edges would have 6 x 4 = 24 dots. However, this assumes that there are no shared dots. As each corner point is counted twice, we need to add 4 dots to the total number, since each corner is actually the start and end point of the edge. Looking at the partial diagram, we can count 12 visible dots. The carpet shape is a square. So 4 edges. Since we are told each edge has two rows of dots, the corner must have 4 dots. If we count 6 dots along one of the edge and there are 4 rows, so 6 dots times 4 sides, so 6x4=24. But dots at the corner are counted twice. So, we need to consider that each side consists of 8 dots. The edges have two rows of three dots, so each side has 2 * 4 = 8 dots. The carpet has 4 sides. So, in total there are 8 x 4 = 32 dots.
Since each edge has two rows of dots, we can observe there are 8 dots along the side. 8 dots x 4 sides= 32 dots. If we actually count them instead of assuming it's a regular grid, we have 3 rows x 4 columns=12 visible dots. So we need to infer the square. Since there are 3 dots along the edge and two rows, so it must be 3+3 rows of dots, so there are 8 dots on each edge. Since we are told that each edge has the same number of dots, which is 6, we have 6 x 4 = 24 dots, but then we also need to count how many dots in total. However, we can notice on the diagram, each corner has 2 dots. Since a corner is shared with each side, we also need to include the corner dots as well. So the number of edges is 4 so in each side has 2+2 = 4, so 8 x 4 =32 dots. If we actually count the diagram we have 3 rows 3 columns, each row contains 2 dots, 2rows x 6 dots=12, there are 36 dots.
Total number of dots on each edge is 3 dots * 2 rows = 6 dots
Each edge has 8 dots, total number of edges = 4
Total number of dots = 4 x 8 dots = 32 dots
There are 8 dots at the each edge, total number of edge 4.
So, the total number of dots is 8x 4= 32.
