Reasoning:
Let $K$ be the number of knights and $N$ be the number of knaves. We are given that $K = 21$ and $N = 2000$.
The total number of people is $21+2000=2021$.
We are considering 2020 people who are divided into 1010 pairs. Let $n_{KK}$ be the number of pairs of knights, $n_{NN}$ be the number of pairs of knaves, and $n_{KN}$ be the number of knight-knave pairs. Then $n_{KK} + n_{NN} + n_{KN} = 1010$.

In a pair of knights, both will call the other a knight, so 2 knights are named.
In a pair of knaves, both will lie and call the other a knight, so 2 knights are named.
In a knight-knave pair, the knight will call the knave a knave, and the knave will call the knight a knight. So one knight and one knave are named.

We are given that 2000 people are called knights and 20 people are called knaves.
Thus, we have $2n_{KK} + 2n_{NN} + n_{KN} = 2000$ (number of people called knights) and $n_{KN} = 20$ (number of people called knaves).
Substituting $n_{KN}=20$ into the first equation, we get $2n_{KK} + 2n_{NN} + 20 = 2000$, so $2n_{KK} + 2n_{NN} = 1980$, and $n_{KK} + n_{NN} = 990$.
We have $n_{KK} + n_{NN} + n_{KN} = 1010$, and $n_{KN} = 20$, so $n_{KK} + n_{NN} + 20 = 1010$, which means $n_{KK} + n_{NN} = 990$.
We are looking for $n_{NN}$. We know that $n_{KK} + n_{NN} = 990$.
Also, we are given that 2020 people are divided into pairs. The number of knights in the pairs must be at most 21.
The number of knaves in the pairs must be at most 2000.
Let $k$ be the number of knights involved in the pairing, and $n$ be the number of knaves involved in the pairing. Then $k+n=2020$. Also, $k \le 21$ and $n \le 2000$.
Let $k_k$ be the number of knights in $n_{KK}$, $k_n$ be the number of knights in $n_{KN}$, $n_k$ be the number of knaves in $n_{KN}$, and $n_n$ be the number of knaves in $n_{NN}$. Then
$2n_{KK} + n_{KN} = k$ and $2n_{NN} + n_{KN} = n$.
Since $n_{KN} = 20$, $2n_{KK} + 20 = k$ and $2n_{NN} + 20 = n$.
Also $k+n = 2020$, so $2n_{KK} + 20 + 2n_{NN} + 20 = 2020$, so $2(n_{KK} + n_{NN}) + 40 = 2020$, so $2(n_{KK} + n_{NN}) = 1980$, and $n_{KK} + n_{NN} = 990$. Since $n_{KK} + n_{NN} + n_{KN} = 1010$, we have $990 + n_{KN} = 1010$, so $n_{KN} = 20$.

We want to find $n_{NN}$, the number of pairs of two knaves.
$n_{KK} + n_{NN} = 990$.
$k = 2n_{KK} + n_{KN} \le 21$, so $2n_{KK} + 20 \le 21$, $2n_{KK} \le 1$, so $n_{KK} \le \frac{1}{2}$.
Since $n_{KK}$ is an integer, $n_{KK} = 0$. Thus, $n_{NN} = 990$.

Reasoning:
Let $KK$ be the number of pairs of knights, $KN$ be the number of pairs of a knight and a knave, and $NN$ be the number of pairs of knaves. Then $KK+KN+NN = 1010$.
If the pair is $KK$, then both call the other a knight.
If the pair is $KN$, then the knight calls the knave a knave and the knave calls the knight a knight.
If the pair is $NN$, then both lie and call the other a knight.
So the number of people called knights is $2KK + KN + 2NN = 2000$.
The number of people called knaves is $KN = 20$.
Then $2KK + 20 + 2NN = 2000$, so $2KK + 2NN = 1980$, and $KK + NN = 990$.
Since $KK + KN + NN = 1010$, we have $KK+20+NN=1010$, so $KK+NN = 990$.
The total number of knights is 21. Thus $2KK+KN \le 21$, so $2KK+20 \le 21$, $2KK \le 1$, so $KK=0$.
Therefore, $NN=990$.
