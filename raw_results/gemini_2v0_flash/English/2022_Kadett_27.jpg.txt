Reasoning:
To ensure every 1x4 and 4x1 rectangle has at least one colored cell, we need to consider the worst-case scenario, which is to have the colored cells as far apart as possible. Placing colored cells strategically will help minimize the number of cells we need to color. A repeating pattern of coloring every fifth cell in each row and column works, which would amount to 5 colored cells. However, that would lead to a 1x4 and 4x1 rectangle without any colored cells.

Let us try to color the grid in such a way that any 4x1 or 1x4 rectangle will have at least one colored cell. One way to achieve this is to color every fifth cell, but staggered. We can choose to color cells (1,1), (1,5), (3,3), (5,1) and (5,5). With this configuration, it seems we can potentially get away with 7 colored cells to fulfill the rule of having at least one colored cell in every possible 1x4 and 4x1 rectangle.
However, this is a hard problem and I think that coloring cells (1,1), (1,5), (3,3), (5,1), (5,5), (2,3), (4,3) will cover all 4x1 and 1x4 rectangles. So, the minimal is likely 7.

Here's one way to color 7 cells so that every 1x4 and 4x1 rectangle has at least one colored cell: (1,2), (2,4), (3,1), (3,3), (3,5), (4,2), (5,4).
Here's how to color 6 cells: (1,1) (1,5), (3,2), (3,4), (5,1), (5,5). This doesn't cover all 4x1 rectangles.
So 7 cells is the minimum we can go.
