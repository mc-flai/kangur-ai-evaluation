Reasoning: Each die has 6 faces, with 2 red, 2 blue, and 2 green. The total number of outcomes when rolling two dice is 6*6=36. The outcomes with the same color are: RR, BB, GG. The probability of each color is 2/6=1/3. Therefore, the probability of RR = (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9; BB = (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9; GG = (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9. The total probability of getting the same color is 1/9+1/9+1/9 = 3/9 = 1/3.
The probability of getting different colors is 1- (probability of getting the same color) = 1-1/3 = 2/3.
