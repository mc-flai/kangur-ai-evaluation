Reasoning:
The problem states that the cactus on the right has 6 more flowers in total than the cactus on the left. It also states that the left cactus has 3 flowers on the back. Since we are asked for the number of flowers on the back of the right cactus, we can say:
Flowers on the back of the right cactus = Flowers on the back of the left cactus + (Total flowers on the right cactus - Total flowers on the left cactus).
Flowers on the back of the right cactus = 3 + 6 = 9.

Answer: A)
