Reasoning:
We need to find the three earliest years that have three identical digits.
The earliest such year is 1110.
The next is 1111.
The third is 2022.
So the minimum age of Eva is 2022 - 1110 = 912.
Then 2022 - 1111 = 911.
We are looking for the third time Eva has experienced a year where the same digit appears three times.
The years are: 1110, 1111, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, ..., 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, ..., 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2111, 2220, 2221, 2222...
The first three times are: 1110, 1111, 2000. Then 2111, 2220...
Thus, the first three such years are 1110, 1111, 2000. Since this year is 2022, the minimum age is 2022-2000=22.
So the answer should be 22.
Let's list out the years with three or more digits: 1000, 1001, 1002,...,1100, 1101, 1110, 1111,1112, ...,2000,2001,2002,...,2111,2200,2211,2220,2221,2222.
The first three years with the same digit appearing three times are:
1110, 1111, 2000. This is the third time Tortoise Eva has experienced a year where the same digit appears three times.
The minimum age is 2022 - 2000 = 22.

Answer: B)
