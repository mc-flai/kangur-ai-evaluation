Reasoning:
The original shape has 5 squares. Dennis takes off one square, leaving 4 squares. We need to see how many of the 5 shapes shown can be made from these 4 squares. The first two shapes require 4 squares, the third shape also requires 4 squares. The fourth requires 2x2=4 squares, and the fifth requires 4 squares. Therefore, all shapes can be formed.

Answer: E)
