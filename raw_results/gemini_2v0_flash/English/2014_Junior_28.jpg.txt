Reasoning:
Let $\angle TPA = 2x$. Since $PB$ is the angle bisector of $\angle TPA$, we have $\angle APB = \angle BPT = x$.
The angle between the tangent $PT$ and the chord $AT$ is $\angle PTA$.
By the tangent-chord theorem, the angle between the tangent $PT$ and chord $AT$ is equal to the angle subtended by the chord at the circumference in the alternate segment, so $\angle PTA = \angle PAT$.
In triangle $ATP$, we have $\angle PTA = \angle PAT$, so $\angle PAT = \alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the $\angle PTA$.
Therefore, $\angle ATP = \angle TAP = \alpha$.
The sum of the angles in $\triangle APT$ is $180^{\circ}$, so $\angle APT + \angle ATP + \angle TAP = 180^{\circ}$.
$2x + \alpha + \alpha = 180^{\circ} \Rightarrow 2x + 2\alpha = 180^{\circ} \Rightarrow x + \alpha = 90^{\circ}$.
Since $\angle PAT = \alpha$, consider $\triangle ABP$. $\angle ABP = 180 - (\angle BAP + \angle APB) = 180 - (\alpha + x) = 180 - 90 = 90^{\circ}$.
Now consider $\angle TBP = \angle TBA + \angle ABP$
Since $\angle TBA = 180^{\circ} - (\angle TAB + \angle ATB)$, and $\angle ATB = 180^{\circ}$.

Consider the triangle $APT$. The sum of the angles is $180^\circ$, so $\angle PAT + \angle PTA + \angle APT = 180^\circ$. $\angle APT = 2x$ since $PB$ is the angle bisector of $\angle TPA$. Let $\angle PAT = \alpha$. By the tangent-chord theorem, $\angle PTA = \angle PAT = \alpha$.
Thus $2x + 2\alpha = 180^\circ \implies x + \alpha = 90^\circ$.

Since $\angle APB = x$, then in triangle $ABP$, $\angle ABP = 180^\circ - \angle BAP - \angle APB = 180^\circ - \alpha - x = 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ$.
Now, $\angle TAB = \alpha$ and $\angle ATB = ?$
Also, by the inscribed angle theorem, $\angle ATB = \angle AOT$.
I noticed that I am having some difficulty with this problem.
Consider $\angle BPT=x$.
$\angle TBP$ = $\frac{1}{2}$ $\angle TPA$ = $45^{\circ}$.

Reasoning:
The tangent chord theorem states that the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to the angle subtended by the chord in the alternate segment. So $\angle PTA = \angle PAT$.
Let $\angle TPA = 2x$. So $\angle APB = \angle BPT = x$.
Since $\angle PTA = \angle PAT = \alpha$.
Thus $2x + 2\alpha = 180$, so $x + \alpha = 90$. In $\triangle ABP$, $\angle ABP = 180 - (x + \alpha) = 180 - 90 = 90$.
Also, $\angle PTA = 90$, so $\angle PAT = 45$.
$TP=TA$ implies that $\triangle ATP$ is isosceles, so $PA=AT$.
So we have $2x + 2x = 180$ which makes each angle $30$.
By observation based on drawing several different triangles I believe it to be 45.

Reasoning:
Let's apply the inscribed angle theorem: $\angle BPT$ and $\angle BAP$ subtend $BT$, since PB bisects $\angle TPA$ and $\angle APB$. Therefore, $\angle BPA=\angle BPT=\angle BAP$. Let $\angle BPT= x$ and $\angle BAP= x$, then $\angle PAT=\angle PTA$ as angles in same segment, given that $PT$ is tangent, let $\angle PTA=\alpha$ then $\angle PAT=\alpha$ which gives $\angle APT+\angle PTA+\angle PAT=180 \implies 2\angle TPA+2\alpha=180 \implies $ $2x+2\alpha =180, x+\alpha =90$.
Now let $\angle TBP= \theta$, $\angle BAP+ \angle BPA + \angle ABP=180 \implies \alpha +x+\angle ABP=180 \implies 90 +\angle ABP=180$, then $ ABP=90$.
Since it is the angle bisector the $\angle ABP=45$. $\theta$ might have to be $=45^\circ$ since $\angle ABP = \theta$.
