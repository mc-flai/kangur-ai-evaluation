Reasoning:
Let's analyze the diagram. The height of the stack of rectangles is 6 cm, and there are 3 rows of rectangles. This means that the height of each rectangle is 6 cm / 3 = 2 cm. Looking at the base, we can see that there are 5 rectangles at the base. We don't know the exact length of the base, so let's assume for now that the length of each rectangle is 'x'. The area of the rectangle is then 2x.

In each row, half of a rectangle is shaded gray on each side. So, in each row, the shaded area is equivalent to one whole rectangle. Since there are 3 rows, the total shaded area is the area of 3 rectangles. The height of the stack of rectangles is 6cm and the base is split in 5 equal rectangles. The base would be equivalent to 5x cm. We also know that 5xcm = 2x + 2x +x cm.

To find out what the base measurement is, we could also consider the total base (5x). The base would be equal to 5xcm= 10.5 cm. Since x is the length for each rectangle on the base.
x = 10.5/5 = 2.1 cm
The area for each rectangle is 2cm * 2.1cm = 4.2cm^2
Thus, the area for three rectangles would be equivalent to 4.2 * 3 = 12.6. But that is not the exact measurement, we'll need to adjust to find the exact measure. However, since there is a possibility, according to the diagram, that the base of the triangle is close to 6, then, we would have two rectangles only with width.

Let's use logic instead. The shaded part in each layer is equivalent to the area of one rectangle.
Area of 3 shaded rectangles = Area of 3 rectangles.

Let the width of rectangle = x
Height of rectangle = 2 (6/3 = 2cm)

We know that the 5 blocks = 6 to be equivalent to the height
2 + 2+ 2 = 6
width is approximately close to each individual height.
Therefore, Area shaded = 3 * 2 * x
So, we could assume that x = 2 to be close
Thus the area = 3 * 2 * 2 = 12
Then we have 12.
Since the triangle ends above the rectangles on the end, x must be slightly above 2

Reasoning: By carefully observing the diagram, we can infer that the shaded areas in each row combine to form one full rectangle. Since there are three rows, the total shaded area equals the area of three rectangles. The height of each rectangle is 2cm (6cm total height divided by 3 rows). The length seems to be very close to the height, so it can be assumed that the areas of the three rectangles equals approximately 12.
