Reasoning:
The problem states that among any five consecutive balls, there is exactly one red, one yellow, and one blue ball. Also, after any red ball, the next ball is yellow. Balls 2, 20, and 202 are green.

This means that the colors repeat every five balls.
We need to find the color of the 2021st ball. We can find the remainder when 2021 is divided by 5.
2021 รท 5 = 404 remainder 1.
Since the remainder is 1, the 2021st ball has the same color as the 1st ball.

We know that the 2nd ball is green. Since there is a cycle of 5, the colors of balls 2, 7, 12, 17, 22... are green. The 20th ball is also green.

Let the sequence of colors be represented by $c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5$ and then it repeats.
We know $c_2 = \text{green}$.
The options are green, red, yellow, and blue.
Also, there has to be a red, yellow, and blue in any 5 consecutive balls. So if ball $n$ is red then ball $n+1$ is yellow.
Let's look at the first five balls: $c_1, \text{green}, c_3, c_4, c_5$.
Since balls 2, 20, and 202 are green, let's consider the first few:
1, green, 3, 4, 5
6, green, 8, 9, 10
11, green, 13, 14, 15
...
In general, the balls whose numbers are $5n+2$ are green for integers $n\geq0$.
From the condition about 5 balls, there is one red, one yellow, and one blue. If ball 1 is red then ball 2 is yellow, but ball 2 is green. So ball 1 cannot be red.
However, it could be possible that ball 1 is green. This way, ball 1 could be red, yellow or blue.

Since ball 2 is green, let us explore if ball 1 is red: if so, ball 2 is yellow, but ball 2 is green. Therefore, ball 1 is not red.
Because there is one red, one yellow, and one blue in every five consecutive balls, let's consider the colors.
Also we need to consider that 2021 mod 5 is 1, so the color of ball 2021 should be the color of ball 1.
Since ball 2 is green, let's test if ball 1 is green. Then, since balls 2 and 7 are green, and so on, ball 2017 is green. 2017 + 4 = 2021, so this implies if ball 1 is green, then ball 2021 would also be green. So ball 1 could be green.

If ball 1 is green, the pattern could be green-green-red-yellow-blue. Then in the sequence, positions which have remainder 1 when divided by 5 is green. Since the remainder is 1, and 2021 mod 5 = 1, ball 2021 is green.
