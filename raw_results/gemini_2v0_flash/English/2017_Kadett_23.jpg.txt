Reasoning:
We want to minimize the number of different sums. The possible sums range from 1+2=3 to 9+5=14.
If we add 2 to all numbers from 1 to 9, we get the sums 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. There are 9 sums.
If we add 5 to all numbers from 1 to 9, we get the sums 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. There are 9 sums.

To minimize the number of different sums, we can strategically add either 2 or 5 to each number.
We want to make as many sums the same as possible.
Let's start with the smaller numbers.
1+5 = 6
2+2 = 4
3+5 = 8
4+2 = 6
5+5 = 10
6+2 = 8
7+5 = 12
8+2 = 10
9+5 = 14

Now, try to make a list of sums which repeats as many times as possible.
1 to 9 ->
Add 2 to 1, 2, 3 to get 3, 4, 5.
Add 5 to 4, 5, 6 to get 9, 10, 11.
Add 2 to 7, 8, 9 to get 9, 10, 11.

Let's consider 1+5 = 6.
2+2 = 4
3+2 = 5
4+5 = 9
5+5 = 10
6+5 = 11
7+2 = 9
8+2 = 10
9+2 = 11

The sums would be 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11.
There are 6 different values in total.

Consider the ranges [3,4,5], [6,7,8], [9,10,11], [12,13,14].
We can achieve
3, 4, 5
6, 7, 8
9, 10, 11
12, 13, 14
If we can get at least one value in each range.
If we can shift each value in the next block one to the left.

We can try to find an arrangement with only 5 values.

1 + 2 = 3
2 + 2 = 4
3 + 2 = 5
4 + 5 = 9
5 + 5 = 10
6 + 5 = 11
7 + 5 = 12
8 + 5 = 13
9 + 5 = 14

Consider the values: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Try to cover them with as few distinct values as possible.
6 distinct values can always be achieved.
Try to prove 5 is not possible.

Reasoning:
The range of the sum is from 3 to 14.
Let $a_i$ be either 2 or 5.
$S = \{1+a_1, 2+a_2, 3+a_3, 4+a_4, 5+a_5, 6+a_6, 7+a_7, 8+a_8, 9+a_9 \}$
Let $N$ be the number of different values. We want to find the minimum value of $N$.
If all $a_i = 2$, $S = \{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\}$ and $N=9$
If all $a_i = 5$, $S = \{6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\}$ and $N=9$
We can see that $N$ cannot be greater than 9.

The minimal is 6.
1+5 = 6
2+2 = 4
3+2 = 5
4+5 = 9
5+5 = 10
6+5 = 11
7+2 = 9
8+2 = 10
9+2 = 11

Reasoning:
Let's examine a way to achieve 6 different values.
We need values 3 to 14.
1 + 2 = 3
2 + 2 = 4
3 + 2 = 5
4 + 5 = 9
5 + 5 = 10
6 + 5 = 11
7 + 2 = 9
8 + 2 = 10
9 + 2 = 11
Values: {3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11}.
