Reasoning:
First, convert six weeks into seconds:
6 weeks * 7 days/week * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 3628800 seconds.
Now, we need to find n such that n! = 3628800.
Let's check the options:
A) 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.
B) 7! = 7 * 6! = 7 * 720 = 5040.
C) 8! = 8 * 7! = 8 * 5040 = 40320.
D) 10! = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 3628800.
E) 12! = 12 * 11 * 10! = 12 * 11 * 3628800, which is significantly larger than 3628800.
Therefore, n = 10.

Answer: D)
