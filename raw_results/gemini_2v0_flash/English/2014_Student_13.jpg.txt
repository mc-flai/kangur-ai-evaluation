Reasoning:
Let the radius of the small circle be $r$ and the radius of the big circle be $3r$.
Since AC is a diameter of the big circle, $\angle ABC = 90^\circ$.
Let O be the center of the circles. Let D be the point where BC touches the small circle.
Then OD is perpendicular to BC, and OD = r.
Since $\angle ABC = 90^\circ$, triangle ABC is a right triangle.
Since OD is perpendicular to BC, OD is parallel to AB.
Also, since O is the midpoint of AC, then D is the midpoint of BC.
Therefore, OD is half the length of AB.
Thus, $r = \frac{1}{2} AB = \frac{1}{2} (12) = 6$.
The radius of the big circle is $3r = 3(6) = 18$.
