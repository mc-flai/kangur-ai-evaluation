Reasoning: We are looking for the tallest person. An arrow pointing from person X to person Y means that person X is shorter than person Y. Therefore, the tallest person is the one to whom no arrow points. In the diagram, person F has no arrow pointing to them. So F must be the tallest. However, Person F is not an option. Lets analyze the graph a bit more:
- B is shorter than A, C, and F.
- C is shorter than F.
- D is shorter than A, B, C, E and F.
- E is shorter than A and F.
- F looks to be the tallest, with no arrows pointing to it.
- A has arrows pointing to it from D and E. So A isn't the tallest.

The prompt only gives Person A, B, C, D, and E as answer choices. Lets see who has the least amount of arrows pointing to them.
- A has 2 arrows to it.
- B has 1 arrow to it.
- C has 1 arrow to it.
- D has no arrows to it.
- E has 1 arrow to it.
Therefore, Person D would be the tallest of the given options.

Answer: D)
