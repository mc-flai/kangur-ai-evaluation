Reasoning:
Let $n$ be the number of teams of three.
The total number of participants is $3n$.
Each participant plays against each participant from each of the teams of three exactly once.
The number of games played is the number of pairs of participants from different teams.
For any two teams, there are $3 \times 3 = 9$ games.
The number of ways to choose 2 teams from $n$ teams is $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.
The total number of games played is $9 \times \binom{n}{2} = 9 \times \frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \frac{9n(n-1)}{2}$.
We are given that the number of games is no more than 250.
$\frac{9n(n-1)}{2} \le 250$
$9n(n-1) \le 500$
$n(n-1) \le \frac{500}{9} \approx 55.56$
We need to find the maximum integer $n$ such that $n(n-1) \le 55.56$.
If $n=7$, $n(n-1) = 7 \times 6 = 42 \le 55.56$.
If $n=8$, $n(n-1) = 8 \times 7 = 56 > 55.56$.
Therefore, the maximum number of teams is 7.
