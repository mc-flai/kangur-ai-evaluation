Reasoning: The question asks for the number of pictures where the triangle is placed *after* the square. This means the triangle is on top of the square.

*   In the first picture, the triangle is on top of the square.
*   In the second picture, the triangle is on the bottom, so the square is on top.
*   In the third picture, the triangle is on the bottom, so the square is on top.
*   In the fourth picture, the triangle is on the bottom, so the square is on top.
*   In the fifth picture, the triangle is on top of the square.

So, there are 2 pictures where the triangle is placed after the square (on top of the square).
