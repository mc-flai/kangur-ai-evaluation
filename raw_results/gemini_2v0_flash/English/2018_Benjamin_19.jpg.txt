Reasoning:
Let's analyze the movements of the ladybugs step by step. One ladybug is asleep and stays in the same spot. Looking at the images provided, we can see the positions after the first, second, and third whistles.
Initial position: Ladybugs are at (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), and (4,2). Let's assume the one in (1,1) is the one asleep.

First whistle:
- (2,1) must move, can go to (1,1) (but that spot is taken) or (2,2) (taken) or (3,1). Let's assume (2,1) -> (3,1)
- (2,2) must move, can go to (1,2) or (2,1) or (3,2).
- (4,2) must move, can go to (3,2) or (4,1) or (4,3).
- (1,1) stays.
One possible config: (1,1), (3,1), (1,2), (3,2)

Second whistle:
- (1,1) stays.
- (3,1) must move, can go to (2,1), (4,1), (3,2).
- (1,2) must move, can go to (1,1) (taken), (2,2), (1,3).
- (3,2) must move, can go to (2,2), (4,2), (3,1).
One possible config: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,2)

Third whistle:
- (1,1) stays.
- (2,1) must move, can go to (3,1), (1,1) is taken, (2,2) is taken.
- (2,2) must move, can go to (1,2), (2,1) is taken, (3,2).
- (4,2) must move, can go to (3,2), (4,1), (4,3).
One possible config: (1,1), (3,1), (1,2), (3,2)

Fourth whistle:
- (1,1) stays.
- (3,1) must move, can go to (2,1), (4,1), (3,2).
- (1,2) must move, can go to (1,1) (taken), (2,2), (1,3).
- (3,2) must move, can go to (2,2), (4,2), (3,1).

Looking at the possible options, only C appears to be a viable state based on the constraints of the movement described.

Answer: C)
