Reasoning: Let $n$ be the number of times the summand $2018^2$ appears under the square root. Then the equation is
$$\sqrt{n \cdot 2018^2} = 2018^{10}$$
Squaring both sides, we have
$$n \cdot 2018^2 = (2018^{10})^2 = 2018^{20}$$
Dividing both sides by $2018^2$, we get
$$n = \frac{2018^{20}}{2018^2} = 2018^{20-2} = 2018^{18}$$
Therefore, the summand $2018^2$ appears $2018^{18}$ times.
