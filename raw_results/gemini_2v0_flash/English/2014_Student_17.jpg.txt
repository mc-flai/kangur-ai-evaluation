Reasoning:
Let $F$ be the amount of fat and $D$ the dry substance.
We are given that the total amount of fat is 24%. Thus, $F = 0.24$.
We are also given that the fat in the dry substance is 64%. This means that the amount of fat is 64% of the dry substance, so $F = 0.64D$.
Since $F = 0.24$, we have $0.24 = 0.64D$, which means $D = \frac{0.24}{0.64} = \frac{24}{64} = \frac{3}{8} = 0.375$.
Therefore, the dry substance is 37.5%.
Since the cheese consists of the dry substance and water, and the total is 100%, the amount of water is $100\% - 37.5\% = 62.5\%$.
