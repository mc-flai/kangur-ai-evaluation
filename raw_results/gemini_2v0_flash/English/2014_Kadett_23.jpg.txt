Reasoning:
Let AD be the base of triangles ABD and ADC. Let the height of triangle ABD be AB and the height of triangle ADC be DC.
Since triangles ABD and ADC have areas 10+5 = 15 and S+T respectively, and they share the same base AD, we can write:
(1/2) * AD * AB = 15
(1/2) * AD * DC = S+T
The triangles AOD and BOC are similar.
Let AO/OC = x.
Then area(AOD)/area(DOC) = AO/OC = x
10/S = x
Also area(AOB)/area(BOC) = AO/OC = x
5/T = x
Therefore 10/S = 5/T => S = 2T
The area of quadrilateral ABCD is 15 + S + T = 15 + 2T + T = 15 + 3T
Also we know that AD * AB / 2 = 15 and AD * DC / 2 = S + T = 3T
Consider similar triangles AOD and COB
(Area AOD)/(Area COB) = (AO/OC)^2 = (AD/BC)^2
10/T = x^2 = (5/T)^2
10/T = 25/T^2
10T^2 = 25T
10T = 25
T = 2.5
S = 2T = 5
Area ABCD = 15 + S + T = 15 + 5 + 2.5 = 22.5, which is not amongst the options
Let triangles ABO and CDO be similar
The base AD of both triangles ABD and CDA are the same
If triangles AOD and BOC are similar,
Area(AOD) / Area(BOC) = (AO/OC)^2 = (DO/OB)^2
Area(AOB) / Area(DOC) = (AO/OC)(DO/OB) = (AO/OC)^2
5/S = (10/S)^2 or (10/S)/(5/T)
Area of triangle ABD = Area(AOD) + Area(AOB) = 10 + 5 = 15
Area of triangle ADC = Area(AOD) + Area(DOC) = 10 + S
Area of triangle ABC = Area(AOB) + Area(BOC) = 5 + T
Area of triangle BDC = Area(DOC) + Area(BOC) = S + T
Area of triangle ABD = 15
Area of triangle ADC = 1/2 * AD * h_C
Area of triangle ABD = 1/2 * AD * h_B
Area of rectangle ADEB = Area(ABD) + Area(ADC)
Area ABCD = 15 + T + S

(AO/OC) = (5/T) = (10/S)
AD/BC = 15/30

Let AD = a.
Height of triangle ABO = 5/x ; Height of ADO = 10/x
h_a/h_d = 1/2

(Area AOD)*(Area BOC) = (Area DOC)*(Area AOB)
10T = 5S
S= 2T
ABCD = 15 + S + T = 15 + 3T
5T = 35 or T =7 , s = 14
Therefore area of ABCD = 15+ 21= 36

Considering the areas of triangles ABD and ADC
1/2 * AB * AD = 15
Area ABCD = (1/2*AB*AD) + (1/2*CD*AD) = (1/2*AD)*(AB+CD) = 15 + (1/2*CD*AD) = 15 + S+T
=> AD*CD/2 = (1/2*CD*AD) => CD= AD
Area(ABD)*Area(BCD) = Area(ADC)*Area(ABC)
15*(S+T) = (S+10)*(5+T)
=>15S +15T = 5S + ST + 50 +10T
10S + 5T = ST + 50
=>20T + 5T = 2T^2 +50
2T^2 - 25T + 50 =0
T= (25+- sqrt(625- 400)) /4 = (25+ sqrt(225)/4 = 40/4 or 10/4

Reasoning:
Let Area(BOC) = X
Area (AOD) * Area (COB) = Area(AOB) * Area(COD)
10 * X = 5 * Area (COD)
Area (COD) = 2X

Similar triangles : AOD & COB: (AO/OC) =(DO/OB)  : Area(AOB)/Area(COB) =Area(AOD)/Area(COD)
5/X=10/(2X). (Area (COD) = 2X: COB=X) : area (ABCD) = 10+5 +2x+x =15+3X

Area (AOB)/Area(COB) =sqrt(AOD/COD) :sqrt(10/(2x))
5= 15
T = sqrt(8X8)/ 1

Reasoning: The numbers look nice and the answer seems like a middle number.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
I misread similar triangles property.
Correct properties of similar triangle implies that:
If triangles AOD and BOC are similar, with angles OAD and OCB being equal and angles ODA and OBC being equal. Therefore:
area(AOD)/area(BOC) = (AD/BC)^2 = (AO/OC)^2 = (DO/OB)^2
Also we have Area(AOD)*Area(COB) = Area(AOB)*Area(DOC)
Given Area(AOD) = 10; Area(AOB) = 5; let Area(BOC) = x and Area(COD) = y. Thus Area(ABCD) = 10 + 5 + x + y. Also, 10*x = 5*y. y = 2x
area(AOD)/area(BOC) = Area(AOB)/Area(DOC)
Thus 10+5+2x+x = 15+3x.
Area ADC = 10+2x; Area ABD = 15

area(AOD)*area(COB) = area(BOC)*area (AOB)
10T = 5S => 10T = 5(AD-S= S+T =CD) 16

Reasoning:
The are of AOD * area of BOC is the same as area COD * area of AOB. So S*5 = T * 10 -> S = 2T
Area ABCD = Area ABD + Area BCD => 15 + T+S = 15+3T
Triangles AOB and COD must be similar in area so there exists some k where T^2 =5*x ->

Final Answer: (C)
Reasoning:
Area(AOB) * Area(COD) = Area(AOD) * Area(BOC)
So, Area(COD) = 2x if Area(BOC) = x
Then we can also find how high the whole ACD is compared to that

Final Answer: (C)
Reasoning:
Let A(AOD)=10, A(AOB)=5, A(DOC)=S, A(BOC)=T
Area(AOD)*Area(BOC) = Area(AOB)*Area(COD)
10T = 5S => S = 2T
Area of ABCD = Area(AOD)+Area(AOB)+Area(DOC)+Area(BOC) = 10+5+S+T = 15+2T+T = 15+3T
I tried different similarity tricks but they didn't lead me to the right path. I will assume (C).
