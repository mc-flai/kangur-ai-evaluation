Reasoning:
Let the side length of the cube be $s = 2$. Let the radius of each hemisphere be $r$, so the diameter is $2r$. Since the hemispheres on adjacent faces touch at one point, the distance between the centers of two adjacent hemispheres is the sum of their radii, which is $r + r = 2r$. The centers of the adjacent faces are located on the centers of those faces. Therefore, the distance between the centers is half of the cube side length, which is $s = 2$. However, we're considering adjacent faces so that we can find $2r$ using the geometry.
Let the centers of two adjacent hemispherical holes be $A$ and $B$. Then $AB$ has a length of 2. Let the radius of each hole be $r$. Since the hemispheres touch at one point, the distance between the centers $A$ and $B$ is $2r$.
Therefore, $2r = 2$. So $r = 1$. The diameter of each hole is $2r = 2$.
Then the diameter of each hole is the side length of the cube, which is 2.

Reasoning:
The distance between the centers of two adjacent hemispherical holes is $s=2$.
Since the hemispheres touch each other at exactly one point, the distance between their centers is the sum of their radii, i.e. $r + r = 2r$. Thus, $2r = s = 2$, which means the diameter is $2r = 2$.
