Reasoning: The question asks which numbers can be written in the field with the question mark, given that numbers 1-7 must be used, and consecutive numbers are not allowed in adjacent fields (fields sharing an edge or corner).
The question mark field has four adjacent fields. Let's analyze the possibilities:
-If we put 1 in the question mark field, we can't put 2 in any of the adjacent fields.
-If we put 2 in the question mark field, we can't put 1 or 3 in any of the adjacent fields.
-If we put 3 in the question mark field, we can't put 2 or 4 in any of the adjacent fields.
-If we put 4 in the question mark field, we can't put 3 or 5 in any of the adjacent fields.
-If we put 5 in the question mark field, we can't put 4 or 6 in any of the adjacent fields.
-If we put 6 in the question mark field, we can't put 5 or 7 in any of the adjacent fields.
-If we put 7 in the question mark field, we can't put 6 in any of the adjacent fields.

Now let's think if we can put all odd numbers in the question mark field.

If the question mark has an odd number, let's consider a possible situation to test this, If all the adjacent numbers were 2,4,6 in alternating corners then an odd number cannot fit in the question mark field.
If all the adjacent numbers were 1,3,5 in alternating corners then an even number cannot fit in the question mark field.

The odd numbers are:1,3,5,7, even numbers are 2,4,6

After analyzing, it is possible to place all 7 numbers in the question mark field. To prove this point, we can assign the numbers as below.
7,5,3
x,?
1,6,2
Note, that x and ? has to be even or odd depending of the adjacent positions. If 'x' is 4, and the adjacent fields has an odd or an even, then every possibility could be filled. 
Therefore, all 7 numbers.
