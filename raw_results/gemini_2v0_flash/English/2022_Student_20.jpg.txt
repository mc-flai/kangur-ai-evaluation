Reasoning: We need to find integer solutions to the equation x^2 + y^2 = 5^2 = 25.
The possible integer values for x and y are:
x = 0, y = +/- 5 (2 points)
y = 0, x = +/- 5 (2 points)
x = +/- 3, y = +/- 4 (4 points)
x = +/- 4, y = +/- 3 (4 points)
Total number of points = 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 12

Answer: C)
