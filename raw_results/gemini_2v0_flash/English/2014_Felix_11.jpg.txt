Reasoning:
We are looking for numbers that are bigger than 10 and smaller than 32, and can only use digits 1, 2 or 3. This means the numbers have to be two-digit numbers.

The first digit can be 1, 2 or 3. The second digit can be 1, 2, or 3.
If the first digit is 1, the numbers can be 11, 12, 13.
If the first digit is 2, the numbers can be 21, 22, 23.
If the first digit is 3, the numbers can be 31.
Therefore, the possible numbers are: 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 31.
There are 7 such numbers.
