Reasoning:
Let's denote the number in the empty circle between the two houses as 'x' and the number with the question mark as 'y'.

For the first house, the sum of the numbers in the circles is 6 + 2 + 5 + x = 20.
Therefore, 13 + x = 20, which means x = 20 - 13 = 7.

For the second house, the sum of the numbers in the circles is 3 + x + 1 + y = 20.
Since we found x = 7, we have 3 + 7 + 1 + y = 20.
This simplifies to 11 + y = 20, which means y = 20 - 11 = 9.
