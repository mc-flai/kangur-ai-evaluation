Reasoning:
Let's denote the 3x3 table as follows:
a b c
d e f
g h i

We are given the following:
a = 1, c = 3, g = 2, i = 4

The numbers available are 1 to 9, so {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
We've already placed {1, 2, 3, 4}, so the remaining numbers are {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

We know that the sum of the numbers adjacent to 5 is 9.
Let's consider the possible positions for 5:
1. If e = 5, adjacent numbers are b, d, f, h. b+d+f+h = 9
2. If b = 5, adjacent numbers are a, c, e. a+c+e = 1+3+e=4+e = 9 => e = 5. It becomes case 1.
3. If d = 5, adjacent numbers are a, g, e. a+g+e = 1+2+e = 3+e = 9 => e=6.
4. If f = 5, adjacent numbers are c, i, e. c+i+e = 3+4+e=7+e = 9 => e = 2. But 2 is already placed.
5. If h = 5, adjacent numbers are g, i, e. g+i+e = 2+4+e = 6+e = 9 => e = 3. But 3 is already placed.

We have two possible scenarios:
Case 1: e = 5 and b+d+f+h = 9. Remaining numbers are {6, 7, 8, 9}.
Case 2: d = 5 and e = 6. Remaining numbers are {7, 8, 9}.

In case 1, b+d+f+h = 9. Possible combinations are (6+0+1+2), (7+2+0+0), (8+1+0+0)... Since 0 is not allowed, and each of these must be one of {6, 7, 8, 9} (without repeating numbers).
In case 2, d = 5 and e = 6.
a b c   1 b 3
d e f = 5 6 f
g h i   2 h 4

The numbers adjacent to 6 are b, d, f, h, which means b+d+f+h. We know d = 5, so b+5+f+h.

If we assume d = 5 and e = 6. Numbers left: 7, 8, 9
Since 5 has sides that add to 9, the adjacent numbers are a, g, e = 1+2+6=9.
This follows what is given. We need to find sum adjacent to 6:
6 has sides b, d, f, h.
d = 5
b, f, h can be 7, 8, 9 in some order. 7+8+9=24
The sum is 5 + 24 = 29.
The sum of adjacent to 6 (which is e) is b+d+f+h.

If we place:
1 8 3
5 6 7
2 9 4

Then adjacent to 5 is 1, 2, 6. 1+2+6 !=9. This setup is invalid.
1 7 3
5 6 8
2 9 4

1+2+6 !=9. Invalid.
1 9 3
5 6 8
2 7 4
No matter how you try, it does not follow.

Assume we placed 5 in cell b
1 5 3
X e X
2 X 4
Adjacent to 5 = 1+3+e. 4+e=9. e = 5. That's not possible.

Let's try a different configuration.

1 x 3
x 5 x
2 x 4
We need sum of adjacent to 5 to be 9. So it is 1 + 3 +x+x = 9.
So we need two digits next to 5.

1 8 3
x 5 x
2 x 4

1 3 is present.

Let us say 6 is in middle
1 a 3
b 6 c
2 d 4

Numbers left. 5, 7, 8, 9
Adjacent to 6: a, b, c, d

We need to find the sum of a+b+c+d
Also, we need to fit 5 somewhere.

Consider 5 in location a

1 5 3
b 6 c
2 d 4

a+b+5=9. Adjacent numbers. Cannot be right next to 5 or it is wrong, has no common side

1 a 3.  Adjacent cells
x 5 x
2 7 4

Total values add to 45
1+2+3+4+5+5 are gone
So we have values adding that add to 6 or bigger

1 x 3
X 6 x
2 x 4

Assume sum adjacent to 5 is 9.  Since each must be unique
So 1+2+3+4 filled
Values remain 5+6+7+8+9

Reasoning:
We have to find a arrangement to be right
Based upon many tries. i found the right order

1 8 3
7 5 9
2 6 4

5 adjacent =7+8+9+6 does not make it work.

A possible solution is:
1 7 3
8 5 9
2 6 4
Adjacents to 5 sum is 8+7+9+6=30 Not 9!!!

1 8 3
x 5 x
2 x 4
The 4 numbers need to equal to 9 - does not check.

However i noticed from answer choice. 29 is suspicious
If you sum all of the numbers =45
Take the sum 5 and adjacent.

Consider total
1 to 9 add to 45
Remove 6 since 5+ adjacent, it has value 45-16=29.
Reasonable
Answer: E).
Reasoning: After several attempts to construct a valid table, I observed that answer choice (E) 29 is suspiciously close to the sum of all digits (1 to 9), which is 45.  If we assume that the sum of the digits adjacent to 6 is 45 minus (6 + sum of digits adjacent to 5) then the value = 45-6-9 = 30 -1 that is close enough. Due to the limitations in figuring it out, this is best to bet and test by substituting after and refining.
Answer: E).
