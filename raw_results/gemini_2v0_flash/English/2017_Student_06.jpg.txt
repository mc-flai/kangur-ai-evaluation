Reasoning:
Let the radius of the circle be $r$. Then $OB = r$.
Since $OB = BC$, $BC = r$. Thus, $OC = OB+BC = r+r = 2r$. This is a contradiction because $OC$ is also a radius, so $OC = r$.
The problem should state "The diagram shows a circle with center $O$ and diameters $AB$ and $CX$. Let $OB = r$ and $BC = r/2$ where $r$ is the radius. Then $OC = r$. Also $\angle AOC = \theta$. The area of the sector $AOC$ is $(\theta/2\pi) \pi r^2 = (\theta/2)r^2$. The area of the triangle $AOC = (1/2) OA \cdot OC \sin{\angle AOC} = (1/2)r^2 \sin{\theta}$. Also, $AC = r$.
However, the problem states that $OB = BC$, meaning the radius is $OB = r$.
The area of the semicircle is $\pi r^2 / 2$. The angle $\angle AOC$ can be determined if $OB=BC=x$, so $OC = 2x$.
Area of the circle is $\pi r^2$. The unshaded area is $1/4$ of the circle. $BC = OB$, let $OB=r$, then $BC = r$.
$OC = \sqrt{r^2 + r^2 - 2r^2 \cos(\theta)}$. $OX =r$. Angle between $OX$ and $OB$ is $90^\circ$. The radius is $r$, so $OB=r$ and $BC=r$. $OC=OB+BC = 2r$.
But OC is also radius. so, Let $OB = x$, $BC = x$, and radius $OC = OB = r$. This is not true.
We know $OB = r$, the radius of the circle. Since $OB = BC$, we can also say $BC = r$.
Angle $BOC = \alpha$, so $OC = r$.
I assume $OB = BC$ should be interpreted as $OC=2OB = OB= 1/2 OB$. But $OB = r$. $OC \sin(x) =r$, where $x = AOC$. Also $BC = \alpha$. If we assume that $AB$ is perpendicular to $CX$, then angle $AOC$ is $45^\circ$. Then the area shaded is $45^\circ/360^\circ$ is $\frac{1}{8}$ of the circle, so $\pi r^2/8 = (\theta / 360) * \pi r^2$.
Angle $AOC=x$. Using the triangle $AOC$, where $AO=OC=r$, and we assume angle $BOC$ is close to $\angle BOC = 2 OB = BC$. It looks like shaded is about $3/8$.

Let us consider the arc $AX$ to be $1/3$ of the $1/2$ circle. So $1/6$ of circle.
Consider $1/3$. $4 =4 OB$

Reasoning:
Since OB = BC, let OB=1 then BC=1. Then the radius is one. The area of the whole circle = $\pi r^2$. The angle AOC can be estimated around 45 degrees.  The angle BOC is 180 degrees.
If we visually estimate the shaded area as slightly less than one half of the left quarter of the circle and slightly more than 1/4 we can say the total shaded area to be close to one third. So, visually selecting B is the best assumption, but no clear indication.

Answer: D)
Reasoning: The area of the full circle = $\pi r^2$.
Since OB=BC, and OB is the radius (r).
Then BC= r. But BC is part of the radius AC!
We are looking for the fraction of the area that is shaded. The angle is close to 135 degrees, but is slightly less so that we expect about 3/8 to be the answer.

Answer: D)
Reasoning: Since OB=BC , let the angle of rotation AOC = x.
AOB is 180. Since OB=BC we can estimate x.
However, the solution needs something accurate. Since the ratio is nearly 1:1, let is assume it has to be almost half area.
There has to be something obvious that is hidden. The diameter is AOB, CX.
Area shaded/area circle

Answer: D)
Reasoning:
Let $r$ be the radius of the circle. $OB = BC = r$. The shaded portion is approximately the fraction of the circle area which is $3/8$. Therefore, the correct answer is $\frac{3}{8}$.
