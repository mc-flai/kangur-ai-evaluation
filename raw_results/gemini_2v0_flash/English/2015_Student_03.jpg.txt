Reasoning:
We need to find the number of real solutions for the equation 2^(2x) = 4^(x+1).
We can rewrite the equation as:
2^(2x) = (2^2)^(x+1)
2^(2x) = 2^(2(x+1))
2^(2x) = 2^(2x+2)
Since the bases are equal, we can equate the exponents:
2x = 2x + 2
Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:
0 = 2
This equation is never true, regardless of the value of x. Therefore, there are no real solutions to the equation.
