Reasoning:
The complete figure is made of 18 cubes. We can see the shapes formed by the white cubes (4 cubes) and the black cubes (5 cubes). Therefore, the gray cubes must make up the remaining 18 - 4 - 5 = 9 cubes. Option A shows only 7 cubes, option B shows only 6 cubes, option C shows only 6 cubes. Option D shows only 6 cubes. Only option E represents 9 cubes. Looking at the original figure, the gray part has a group of 4 cubes together with another group of 5 cubes attached. Option E matches the correct shape.

Answer: E)
