Reasoning:
The sum of digits from 1 to 9 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45. Let the three three-digit numbers be a, b, and c. Their sum is a + b + c.
We can write a = 100*a1 + 10*a2 + a3, b = 100*b1 + 10*b2 + b3, c = 100*c1 + 10*c2 + c3.
Then a + b + c = 100*(a1+b1+c1) + 10*(a2+b2+c2) + (a3+b3+c3).
Since all digits from 1 to 9 are used exactly once, a1+b1+c1+a2+b2+c2+a3+b3+c3 = 45.
a + b + c = 100*(a1+b1+c1) + 10*(a2+b2+c2) + (a3+b3+c3).

If the sum of the three numbers is 1500, 1500 = 100A + 10B + C, where A = a1+b1+c1, B = a2+b2+c2, C = a3+b3+c3.
So we need A, B, and C to be digits such that A+B+C = 45 and 100A + 10B + C = sum.

Let's consider the remainder when the sum is divided by 9.
The sum of the digits is 45, which is divisible by 9. So the remainder of the sum when divided by 9 must be 0.
Let's check the remainders of the options when divided by 9:
A) 1500 % 9 = (1+5+0+0) % 9 = 6 % 9 = 6
B) 1503 % 9 = (1+5+0+3) % 9 = 9 % 9 = 0
C) 1512 % 9 = (1+5+1+2) % 9 = 9 % 9 = 0
D) 1521 % 9 = (1+5+2+1) % 9 = 9 % 9 = 0
E) 1575 % 9 = (1+5+7+5) % 9 = 18 % 9 = 0

Since the sum of the digits must be divisible by 9, 1500 cannot be the sum.

Reasoning:
The sum of the digits 1 through 9 is 45. Therefore, the sum of the three three-digit numbers must be congruent to 45 mod 9, which is 0 mod 9. This means the sum must be divisible by 9.

Checking the options:
A) 1500: 1+5+0+0 = 6. Not divisible by 9.
B) 1503: 1+5+0+3 = 9. Divisible by 9.
C) 1512: 1+5+1+2 = 9. Divisible by 9.
D) 1521: 1+5+2+1 = 9. Divisible by 9.
E) 1575: 1+5+7+5 = 18. Divisible by 9.

The only number that is not divisible by 9 is 1500.
