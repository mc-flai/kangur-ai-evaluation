Reasoning:
The given linear function is f(x) = -3.5x + 7.
First, let's find the x and y intercepts.
y-intercept: When x = 0, f(0) = -3.5(0) + 7 = 7. So, the y-intercept is (0, 7).
x-intercept: When f(x) = 0, -3.5x + 7 = 0 => 3.5x = 7 => x = 7/3.5 = 2. So, the x-intercept is (2, 0).

Since the slope is -3.5, the line is decreasing.
The y-intercept is (0, 7), which is on the positive y-axis.
The x-intercept is (2, 0), which is on the positive x-axis.
Therefore, the line passes through quadrant I.
When x is negative, for example, x = -1, f(-1) = -3.5(-1) + 7 = 3.5 + 7 = 10.5. The point is (-1, 10.5), which is in quadrant II.
As x increases, y decreases. Eventually, y becomes negative when x is greater than 2. When x = 3, f(3) = -3.5(3) + 7 = -10.5 + 7 = -3.5. The point is (3, -3.5), which is in quadrant IV.
Since the line is decreasing, it must go through quadrants I, II, and IV.

Thus, the line must pass through quadrants I, II, and IV. The only quadrant that the graph doesn't pass through is quadrant III.
