Reasoning:
The white triangles have vertices that sum to a multiple of 3.
The black triangles have vertices that do not sum to a multiple of 3.

Consider possible values for the center point:
If the center point is 0:
Top black triangle: 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 (not divisible by 3)
Bottom left black triangle: 0 + 2 + ? = 2. We require 2 to not be divisible by 3, so 2+2 or 2+1 would be the possibilities which give a total of 4 or 3 respectively. So center point can be 0.
If the center point is 1:
Top black triangle: 1 + 0 + 2 = 3 (divisible by 3). This is not possible.
If the center point is 2:
Top black triangle: 2 + 0 + 2 = 4 (not divisible by 3)
Bottom left black triangle: 2 + 2 + ? = 4, therefore cannot be divisible by 3, 2+2 or 2+1 would be possibilities. So center point can be 2.

We need to check also if the other adjacent points are satisfied.

Center = 0
Left point 1
Right point 1
Check Black triangles:
Top triangle: 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, valid
Bottom Left: 0+2+1=3 not valid.
Bottom Left 0+2+2=4 valid.

Center = 1
Top triangle: 1 + 0 + 2 = 3, not valid.

Center = 2
Top triangle: 2 + 0 + 2 = 4, valid
Left = 0, Right = 1
Bottom left black triangle: 2 + 2 + 0 = 4 valid.
Right: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 valid

If left = 1, right = 0
Bottom Left: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 valid
Right: 2 + 0 + 2 = 4 valid

Thus the number inside can be 2.
The others sums are:
Top: 0+2+(?)=not divisible by 3
2+2+(?)= not divisible by 3
Thus: ? can equal 0 or 2
Now consider the other black triangles:
0+2+(?) cannot be divisible by 3 => cannot equal 1
Now consider right triangles:
2+2+(?) cannot be divisible by 3 => cannot equal 2
So we have 1 inside.

2+0+(?)
2+2 +(?)
We require that
0+0+2 => valid
0+1+2 => valid
2+0+2 => valid
2+1+2 => valid
If we put a 1:
1+0+2=3, so 1 is NOT valid,
Thus a 2 is a VALID number, a 1 isn't valid.
