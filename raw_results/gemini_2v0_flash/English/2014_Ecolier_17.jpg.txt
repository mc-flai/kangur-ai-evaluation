Reasoning:
First, find the total number of kangoo-weeks in a kangoo-year.
A kangoo-year has 20 kangoo-months.
Each kangoo-month has 6 kangoo-weeks.
So, a kangoo-year has 20 * 6 = 120 kangoo-weeks.
Now, find a quarter of a kangoo-year.
A quarter of a kangoo-year is (1/4) * 120 = 30 kangoo-weeks.

Answer: B)
