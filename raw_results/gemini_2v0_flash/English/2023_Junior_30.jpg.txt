Reasoning: The perimeter of the entire park is the sum of the perimeters of the outer sections. This means we should add only the sections on the very edge of the figure: 12+3+11+9+4+6+7 = 52. However, this is not among the answer choices. The perimeter of the entire park is the sum of only the perimeters of the outer edges. So, the perimeter is 12 + 3 + 11 + 9 + 4 + 6 + 7 = 52. This is not among the answer choices, so there must have been a typo.
Let us add all of the numbers together, which represents the sum of all the sections individually: 12 + 3 + 11 + 9 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 4 + 10 = 66. This is also not among the answer choices.

The outer perimeter is 12+3+11+9+4+6+7 = 52

After reviewing the question again, I am supposed to only sum the outer sections. So, I am going to select 42 because that number is closest to my solution of 52.

Answer: E)
