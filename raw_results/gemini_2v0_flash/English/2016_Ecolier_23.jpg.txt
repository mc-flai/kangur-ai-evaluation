Reasoning:
Let $n$ be the number of blocks in a piece. We split the piece into two pieces such that one part is twice as long as the other. This means we split $n$ into $x$ and $2x$, where $x$ is an integer. Thus, $n = x + 2x = 3x$. Therefore, $n$ must be divisible by 3.

The initial number of blocks is 27, which is divisible by 3. We split it into $x$ and $2x$, so the two pieces have lengths $x$ and $2x$ where $x = 27/3 = 9$. The lengths are 9 and 18.

If we choose the piece of length 9, we split it into pieces of length $9/3 = 3$ and $2(3) = 6$.
If we choose the piece of length 18, we split it into pieces of length $18/3 = 6$ and $2(6) = 12$.

From 9, we can get 3, 6. From 18, we can get 6, 12.
From 3, we can get 1, 2.
From 6, we can get 2, 4.
From 12, we can get 4, 8.

The question asks which of the following pieces can *never* result. Let's analyze the possible lengths:
2: We can get 2 from splitting 3.
4: We can get 4 from splitting 6 or 12.
6: We can get 6 from splitting 9 or 18.
8: We can get 8 from splitting 12.
10: Could we ever get 10? If we had 10, we would have had to split a length of 30.
In each split, we divide by 3, so we could have had 30, but 30 is not possible because we start with 27 blocks.

The possible sizes are of the form $\frac{27}{3^k} 2^j$ for some integers $k$ and $j$ such that $\frac{27}{3^k} 2^j$ is an integer.
Possible sizes: 27, 18, 9, 12, 6, 4, 3, 2, 8, 1, ...

Therefore, the number of blocks that can never result is 10.
