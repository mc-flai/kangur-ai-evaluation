Reasoning:
The problem states "Doris and Ali walk past Leo's house" and "Eva walks past Chole's house". We need to find which house is Eva's.
Looking at the image, there are 5 houses. Let's analyze the paths to the school. The house that is connected with a path directly to the school is Chole's. So if Eva walks past Chole's house she must live at the yellow house with the orange roof, which is labeled as option B.

Answer: B)
