Reasoning: Let the four lines be $y = m_i x$ where $i = 1, 2, 3, 4$. The intersection of the line $y=mx$ and the parabola $y=x^2-2$ occurs when $mx = x^2-2$, which simplifies to $x^2 - mx - 2 = 0$. Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this quadratic equation. According to Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is $x_1 x_2 = -2$.
Since there are four lines, there are four such quadratics, each with a product of roots of $-2$. Therefore the product of the eight x-coordinates is $(-2)^4 = 16$.
