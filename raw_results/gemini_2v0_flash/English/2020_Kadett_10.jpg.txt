Reasoning:
The internal angle of a square is 90 degrees. Therefore, a + b = 90 degrees.
The internal angle of an equilateral triangle is 60 degrees. Therefore, c + b = 60 degrees.
The internal angle of a square is 90 degrees. Therefore, d + e = 90 degrees - 60 degrees = 30 degrees.

Now let's check the options:
A) a = d. From the figure, we can see that a > d. Therefore, this is not true.
B) b + c = d. From the equilateral triangle, b + c = 60 degrees. We know d = 30 degrees. Therefore, this is not true.
C) a + c = d + e. a = 90 - b and d + e = 30. And c = 60 - b. Therefore, 90 - b + 60 - b = 30 and 150 - 2b = 30 or 2b = 120 or b = 60 which is false from looking at the diagram.
D) a + b = d + e. Since a + b = 90 and d + e = 30, therefore it's not true.
E) e + d = a. d + e = 30. From the figure, a = 90 - b. therefore d + e = a is not true.
If the intersection between the triangle and the square has an angle that is close to the corner of the square, angles d and e could be close to 0 degrees and this means a can be closer to 90. However, according to the drawing this also doesn't seem to be true. There seems to be an error in the diagram.
There seems to be an error in the figure. If a is the whole angle of the square (i.e. a = 90 degrees), then d + e = 30 degrees. Therefore a != d+e. Now we have a + c = 90 degrees.

Let's calculate the angles as much as we can:
The angle of an equilateral triangle inside a square is 60 degrees. The full angle of the square is 90 degrees.
d + e = 90 - 60 = 30 degrees.
a + b = 90 degrees.
b + c = 60 degrees.

Let's rewrite a + c = d + e
Then 90 - b + 60 - b = 30
150 - 2b = 30
120 = 2b
b = 60.
This equation isn't consistent with a regular picture.
However, let's focus on the equation c + b = d + e
So since c + b = 60 degrees, d+e = 60 is False.

Let's look at e + d = a. So, we said d + e = 30. and a + b = 90 degrees. Therefor since these values change with b, we can find some value of b such that the equality e + d = a is possible. i.e. 30 = a, which is unlikely.
If the diagram is accurate, the closest result is d + e = a where we make d + e close to a if the angle b closes to the upper corner, that's if we assume that a isn't a whole angle.

Reasoning:
The correct answer is (A). Since a = 90 - b, d = 90 - 60 - e. d+e = 30.
Therefore, a and d are not equal.
I will select (E) assuming there is an error in the picture.

Answer: E)
