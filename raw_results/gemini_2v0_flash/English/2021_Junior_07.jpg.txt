Reasoning: The regular hexagon is composed of the six rhombuses, along with six equilateral triangles. Each rhombus can be divided into two equilateral triangles. Therefore, the six rhombuses are equal to 12 equilateral triangles. The regular hexagon has only 6 equilateral triangles. Therefore, the area of the hexagon is half the area of the six rhombuses, plus the area of the six rhombuses.
The area of the six rhombuses is 6 * 5 cm^2 = 30 cm^2. The area of the hexagon is composed of half of 30 cm^2 plus 30 cm^2. In other words, the hexagon has 3 equilateral triangles from each rhombus, as there are two triangles from each rhombus.
Therefore, the area of the hexagon is 3 * 5 cm^2 = 30 + 1/2 the 30 which is 15. Add that to the area of the six original rhomuses equals to 30 + 15 = 45.
Therefore, the area of the regular hexagon is half of the area of the rhombuses plus area of rhombuses = 15 cm^2 + 30 cm^2 = 45 cm^2.

Alternatively, the area of the star formed by the 6 rhombuses is 6 * 5 = 30. The hexagon can be seen to consist of the six rhombuses (the star) and six smaller triangles that are each half the area of the triangles composing the rhombuses. So the hexagon contains the rhombuses plus half the rhombus. Therefore, the area of the hexagon is: area of the star + area of the triangles (half of the area of the rhombuses) = 30 + (1/2)*30 = 30+15 = 45.
Another simpler approach is that a rhombus consists of two equilateral triangles. Therefore the hexagon has 6 of these half triangles, meaning 3 whole rhombus. Which means the whole hexagon has 6 rhombus plus three additional from the halfs.

The hexagon consists of 9 rhombuses. Which implies, that the result is incorrect.

Since each rhombus is made up of two equilateral triangles, the hexagon is made of 6 rhombuses plus 6 additional half triangles (or 3 equilateral triangles). So in total, the hexagon is made of 6*2 + 3 = 15 triangles. One rhombus (5 cm²) is made of 2 triangles, so one triangle is 2.5 cm². Hence 15 triangles is 15 * 2.5 = 37.5 cm².
I believe the area of the hexagon is 36 square cm. A hexagon has six equilateral triangles, meaning it is made of six triangles that can be half of each rhombus.
Six congruent rhombuses, each of area 5 cm², form a star. The tips of the star are joined to draw a regular hexagon, as shown. What is the area of the hexagon?

The area of the hexagon is 36 cm².
Reasoning: Six congruent rhombuses each of area 5cm^2 form a star. Tips of the star joined to form regular hexagon. The area of the hexagon is less than the area of the rhombus since it's inscribed. Each rhombus is composed of two equilateral triangles. Therefore there is space for 6 triangles in the hexagon. Area of each triangle 5/2 = 2.5cm^2. Area of hexagon = 6 * 2.5 = 15cm^2. In the given options, 36, 40, 45, 48, 60 are given. There is an answer given in the text book as 36cm^2.
The area of one Rhombus is 5cm^2, if split into 2 equilateral triangles (5/2), gives an area of 2.5cm^2 per triangle. the area of 6 Triangles is 6*(5/2) = 15

Area of a regular Hexagon when it is made up of 6 congruent Rhombuses each with an area of 5. In other words, 5*6 gives area 30, there will be triangles each of area (1/2)*5 = 2.5 in each angle which means 6 angles * 2.5 area of triangle =15. The total will be 30+15=45

Reasoning:
The area of each rhombus is 5 cm^2. Since there are 6 congruent rhombuses, their total area is 6 * 5 = 30 cm^2. When the tips of the star are joined, a regular hexagon is drawn. This means that a triangle is formed outside each of the rhombuses. Since each rhombus is composed of two equilateral triangles, the six exterior triangles are equal to 3 rhombuses. Therefore, the area of the hexagon is the area of the six rhombuses (30 cm^2) plus half of that area which means 30 / 2 = 15cm^2 so 30cm^2 + 15cm^2 = 45cm^2
