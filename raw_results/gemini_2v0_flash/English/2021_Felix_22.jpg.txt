Reasoning:
The target plate has 4 star cookies, 3 triangle cookies, 2 moon cookies, 2 heart cookies, and 3 round cookies. A single tray of cookies contains: 2 star cookies, 3 triangle cookies, 1 moon cookie, 1 heart cookie, and 1 round cookie.

Comparing the number of each cookie on the target plate and on the tray:
Star cookies: we need 4 star cookies. A single tray has 2 star cookies. 4 / 2 = 2 trays
Triangle cookies: we need 3 triangle cookies. A single tray has 3 triangle cookies. 3 / 3 = 1 tray
Moon cookies: we need 2 moon cookies. A single tray has 1 moon cookie. 2 / 1 = 2 trays
Heart cookies: we need 2 heart cookies. A single tray has 1 heart cookie. 2 / 1 = 2 trays
Round cookies: we need 3 round cookies. A single tray has 1 round cookie. 3 / 1 = 3 trays

To get the required number of cookies, we must have a minimum of 3 trays.
