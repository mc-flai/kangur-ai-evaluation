Reasoning:
Let $h$ be the number of coins showing "head" and $t$ be the number of coins showing "tail".
Initially, $h=60$. Since there are 150 coins in total, $t = 150 - 60 = 90$.
Let $x$ be the number of coins that show "head" that John has to turn over.
Then the number of coins showing "head" becomes $60 - x$, and the number of coins showing "tail" becomes $90 + x$.
John wants the same amount of coins to show "head" as "tail", so we have
$60 - x = 90 + x$
$2x = 60 - 90 = -30$
$x = -15$.
Since $x$ is negative, this implies the number of coins showing "tail" has to be turned over to show "head".
Let $x$ be the number of coins that show "head" that John has to turn over to "tail".
Then the number of coins showing "head" becomes $60 - x$, and the number of coins showing "tail" becomes $90 + x$.
We want $60 - x = 90 + x$, so $2x = 60 - 90 = -30$, thus $x = -15$.
Since we want the number of coins that show "head" to turn over, we need to turn over $x$ coins so that
$60 - x = \frac{150}{2} = 75$
$x = 60 - 75 = -15$.
Then we need to turn over the amount of coins showing tail to head instead.
Let $x$ be the number of coins showing "head" that John turns over to "tail". Then the number of heads is $60-x$ and the number of tails is $90+x$. We want $60-x = 90+x$, so $2x = -30$ and $x=-15$, which doesn't make sense.
Let the final number of heads and tails be $y$. Then $y = 150/2 = 75$.
So the number of heads must be 75. We have 60 heads. To get 75 heads, we need to turn over tails to heads. Let $x$ be the number of heads we turn over. Then we have $60 - x$. The number of tails we turn over is $x$. The number of tails we have is $150 - 60 = 90$.
The number of tails will decrease by $x$ to $90 - x$.
The number of heads after turning over $x$ heads is $60 - x$. We have $60 - x = 75$ which gives $x = -15$, which means we turn tails to heads.
Since each head we turn over becomes a tail, the number of heads decreases by 1 and the number of tails increases by 1. Let $x$ be the number of heads we turn over.
$60 - x = 150/2 = 75$
So, $x = -15$, which means that instead of turning head to tail, we are doing the other way around.
Let $x$ be the amount of heads we turn to tails, then $60 - x = 75$ or $150 - (60-x) - x = 75$. So we want $150 - (60-x) = 75 + x$ or $150/2 = 75$. The number of heads should be 75. Turning x heads into tails gives the tails as 90 + x and the heads 60-x.
We want to find x such that $60-x=90+x=75$. So $x=15$, the number of heads to be switched. We have $60-15 = 45$ heads and $90+15=105$ tails, but we want $75$ and $75$.

The difference between heads and tails is $90-60 = 30$. If $x$ is the number of heads to flip, we have $60 - x = 90 + x$, thus $2x = -30$, $x = -15$, so flip tails to heads.
Then the number of heads is $60-x$ and number of tails is $90+x$. Let $H = T = y$. Then $2y = H + T = 150$.
Then $y = 75$. So $60 - x = 75$, which means $x = -15$. Which is not possible since the only coins that can be flipped are the 60 heads.

If the number of heads becomes 75 then we must have changed tails into heads so it is heads+x = 75 and $60 + x = 75$ and $x = 15$. The tails must be turned into heads. But the questions ask to how many heads turn into tails.
Then the total number of heads = tails when $60-x = 90+x \rightarrow 2x = 60 - 90 = -30 \rightarrow x = 15$.
The number of heads to turn over is such that $60-x=75$ means $x=15$ as well
$60-x=75$ so $x=-15$.
$60-x=90 +x $, $2x = -30$ so $x=-15$.

Then $150 / 2= 75$, $60-x = 75$ so heads becomes tails.
Let $x$ to be the number to be turned over.
Then $90/150 - x = 75/150$. However we can't turn all tails over.
We need to remove 15 so heads become tails at each switch so we need 30 removed
$\frac{60}{150} -x = 1/2$ since each is $1/2$.
$ \frac{60- x }{150 } = 0,5$ then $60 -x =75$. Then

$T-H/2$

Reasoning: The total number of coins is 150, so each side must have 75 to have the same amount. Currently, Heads has 60. So $75-60 = 15$ heads. Also $Tails= 150- 60=90$ and $90-75=15$ so to obtain equal sides, $30/2 =15$ coins need to be switched. Number of coins must decrease so turn head to tail at equal switch. If $H-x=T+x$ after turns. This is $2T+2x= $number

30 coins need to be switched but we do not know which switch to be made. Head and Tail can be $ 70 and80$ if switched 10 times. The amount must be at a switch so its $15$
