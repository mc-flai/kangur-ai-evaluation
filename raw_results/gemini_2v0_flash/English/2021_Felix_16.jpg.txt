Reasoning: Let's say the kangaroo ate 'x' leaves from the first branch. Then, the leaves left on the first branch would be 10 - x. According to the question, from the second branch, it ate as many leaves as were left on the first branch, so it ate (10 - x) leaves from the second branch.
The leaves left on the second branch would be 10 - (10 - x) = x.
The total leaves left on both the branches = leaves left on first branch + leaves left on second branch
= (10 - x) + x = 10.
