Reasoning:
We need to find the last year before 2014 where all the digits are distinct and the last digit is greater than the sum of the other three digits.
We will start searching backwards from 2013.

-2013: 2+0+1 = 3 < 3 No
-2012: 2+0+1 = 3 < 2 No
-2010: 2+0+1 = 3 < 0 No
-2009: digits not distinct
-2008: digits not distinct
-2007: digits not distinct
-2006: digits not distinct
-2005: digits not distinct

Let's check the 1900s:
We're looking for a year 1abc where a+b+c < c, where a, b, and c are all distinct.
This simplifies to a+b < 0, which is not possible.

Let's check the 1800s:
-1876: 1+8+7 = 16 > 6 No
-1875: 1+8+7 = 16 > 5 No
...
-1800s. Let's try lower numbers.

-1700s
-1789: 1+7+8 = 16 > 9 No
-1769: 1+7+6 = 14 > 9 No
-1759: 1+7+5 = 13 > 9 No

-1600s
-1679: 1+6+7 = 14 > 9 No

-1500s
-1589: 1+5+8 = 14 > 9 No

Let's try 1000s

-1023: 1+0+2 = 3 < 3 No

Checking 1000s is useless, since the first digit is 1.

Let's consider when the first digit is 1.
If the digits are 1abc, and they must be distinct, and 1+a+b < c. Also, a, b, c must be different and can range from 0 to 9.
Let's rewrite this. 1+a+b < c

We should consider low numbers.
Consider 102_: There are three numbers higher: 3.
1023 works since 1+0+2=3 < 3 Nope
Consider 12__:
Consider 123_. 1+2+3 = 6. Therefore the last digit could be: 7, 8, 9

1237: is a distinct number 1237

2014-1237 = 777 years ago. None of the options fit with this answer.
Let's consider 100s

-100s- 990s and below will require the numbers to add to a number greater than 9 for this to hold.

Let's look at the smallest example that can exist: 012_:
1+2 = 3 so the number must be > 3
0124 - yes 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 < 4.
2014-0124 = 1890
The digits must all be different. Let's list the potential answers.
Years ago was it last the case?
Let's look at what we have found:

1abc where 1+a+b < c. Let a=0, b=2. C = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
1023 : NO
Let's use high numbers, and make the leading digit smaller:
0abc: We can ignore the leading digit for comparison sake.
abc, a+b < c
We want to check until we fail to find one.
Let's guess 1609: 1+6+0 = 7 < 9: Yes!
2014-1609 = 405.

Reasoning:
After analyzing various years, I'm finding that no answers are giving accurate deductions. There is a huge amount of possible solutions until we go back 400 years,
Based on previous calculations, my answer is estimated.

Answer: D)
