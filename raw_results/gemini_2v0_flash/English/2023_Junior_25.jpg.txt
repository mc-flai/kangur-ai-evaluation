Reasoning:
Let $t$ be the amount of time she spends on each activity (phoning, surfing, and not using).
Since she has a half-full battery, the battery life is half of the full battery life.
The fraction of the battery consumed by phoning is $t/32$.
The fraction of the battery consumed by surfing the internet is $t/20$.
The fraction of the battery consumed by not using the phone is $t/80$.
The sum of these fractions must equal 1/2 (since the half-full battery is completely consumed).
Therefore, $t/32 + t/20 + t/80 = 1/2$.
To solve for $t$, find a common denominator for 32, 20, and 80, which is 160.
Multiply each term by 160:
$160(t/32) + 160(t/20) + 160(t/80) = 160(1/2)$
$5t + 8t + 2t = 80$
$15t = 80$
$t = 80/15 = 16/3$
Since she spends $t$ hours on each activity, the total time of the train ride is $3t$.
Total time = $3t = 3(16/3) = 16$ hours.
