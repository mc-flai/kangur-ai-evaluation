Reasoning:
1. Adam removes every sixth tile. This means 5/6 of the tiles remain.
2. Beate removes every fifth of the remaining tiles. This means 4/5 of the tiles remain.
3. Cora removes every fourth of the remaining tiles. This means 3/4 of the tiles remain.
4. Therefore, the number of tiles remaining is 2022 * (5/6) * (4/5) * (3/4) = 2022 * (5*4*3)/(6*5*4) = 2022 * (60/120) = 2022 * (1/2) = 1011.
