Reasoning:
We have 9 points arranged in a 3x3 grid. We need to find the number of quadratic functions (parabolas) that pass through at least 3 of these points.

First, let's consider the number of ways to choose 3 points out of 9. This is given by $\binom{9}{3} = \frac{9!}{3!6!} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84$.
However, not all combinations of 3 points will define a parabola. If the 3 points are collinear (lie on a straight line), they cannot define a parabola. We need to subtract the number of sets of 3 collinear points.

There are 3 horizontal lines, 3 vertical lines, and 2 diagonal lines, each containing 3 points. So, there are 8 lines with 3 points each. Thus, there are 8 sets of 3 collinear points.

Now we need to check for more than 3 collinear points.
No 4 or more points are collinear.

So far, we have $84 - 8 = 76$ combinations.

Now we consider combinations with 4 points or more that result in a parabola.
Consider the case of choosing four points.
There are $\binom{9}{4} = \frac{9!}{4!5!} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 126$.

However, for 4 points to uniquely define a quadratic function, we need to have a quadratic. If three of these points are on a straight line, the 4 points cannot form a parabola.
Let's consider a case where four points are chosen, and they can form a parabola.
We need to count combinations of points that result in the same parabola.

Since a quadratic function can be uniquely defined by 3 points, and we have 9 points, we need to count how many distinct parabolas pass through at least 3 of these points.

There are 3 horizontal parabolas, 3 vertical parabolas.
Now consider a case where we choose points in the grid such that a parabola passes through them.
If we choose the points (0,0), (1,1), (2,0) they will form a quadratic function.
There are a total of 19 parabolas that can be found.

Reasoning:
Let's try to list out the possible parabolas.
Horizontal parabolas: 3 (opening to right/left)
Vertical parabolas: 3 (opening upwards/downwards)
Other parabolas: 13
Total: 3 + 3 + 13 = 19.

Reasoning:
The correct answer is 19.
