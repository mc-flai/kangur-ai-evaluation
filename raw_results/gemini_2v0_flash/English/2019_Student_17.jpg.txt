Reasoning:
Maria can win in two ways: either Johann picks a chocolate ball on his first pick and Maria picks the boiled sweet on her first pick, or Johann picks a chocolate ball on his first pick, Maria picks a chocolate ball on her first pick, Johann picks a chocolate ball on his second pick, and Maria picks the boiled sweet on her second pick.

Probability that Johann picks chocolate on his first pick = 4/5
Probability that Maria then picks the boiled sweet = 1/4
Probability that Maria wins on her first pick = (4/5) * (1/4) = 1/5

Probability that Johann picks chocolate on his first pick = 4/5
Probability that Maria picks chocolate on her first pick = 3/4
Probability that Johann picks chocolate on his second pick = 2/3
Probability that Maria then picks the boiled sweet = 1/2
Probability that Maria wins on her second pick = (4/5) * (3/4) * (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/5

Total probability that Maria wins = 1/5 + 1/5 = 2/5
