Reasoning:
We are given that there are five children: Ali, Lea, Josef, Vittorio, and Sophie.
The cakes have the numbers 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4.
We know Vittorio is the youngest. So Vittorio is 4.
Lea is two years older than Josef. Lea = Josef + 2.
Lea is one year younger than Ali. Lea = Ali - 1. This means Ali = Lea + 1.
So the ages are: Josef, Lea, Ali.
The available ages are 5, 6, 7, 8.
If Josef is 5, Lea is 7, and Ali is 8. This is a valid arrangement.
So Josef = 5, Lea = 7, Ali = 8, and Vittorio = 4.
The remaining age is 6. Hence Sophie's age must be 6.
Therefore, the cake belonging to Sophie has the number 6.
