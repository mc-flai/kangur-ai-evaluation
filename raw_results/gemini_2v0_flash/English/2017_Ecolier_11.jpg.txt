Reasoning: To minimize the number of packages, we need to buy as many of the largest packages as possible.
We can buy two 25-piece packages, which gives us 50 balloons. Then we need 20 more. We can get this with two 10-piece packages. That's a total of 2+2 = 4 packages.
Another way to make 70 is one 25-piece package, four 10-piece packages, and one 5-piece package. This gives us 1+4+1 = 6 packages.
Another way to make 70 is to use seven 10-piece packages which would require 7 packages.
Another way to make 70 is to use fourteen 5-piece packages which would require 14 packages.
So, the minimum number of packages is 4.
