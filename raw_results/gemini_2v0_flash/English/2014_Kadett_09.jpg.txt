Reasoning: To determine which product is largest, we can approximate each calculation.
(A) 44 x 777 is approximately 40 x 800 = 32000
(B) 55 x 666 is approximately 60 x 700 = 42000
(C) 77 x 444 is approximately 80 x 400 = 32000
(D) 88 x 333 is approximately 90 x 300 = 27000
(E) 99 x 222 is approximately 100 x 200 = 20000

Based on these estimations, option (B) yields the largest product. Let's calculate (A) and (B) exactly to be sure.
(A) 44 * 777 = 34188
(B) 55 * 666 = 36630
(C) 77 * 444 = 34188
(D) 88 * 333 = 29304
(E) 99 * 222 = 21978
So B is the largest product.

Answer: B)
