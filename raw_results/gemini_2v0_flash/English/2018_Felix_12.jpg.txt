Reasoning: The two-digit numbers must be formed using the digits 2, 0, 1, and 8, must be greater than 10 and less than 25, and must consist of two different digits.

We can list the possibilities:
Starting with 1: 10, 12, 18 (3 numbers)
Starting with 2: 20, 21 (2 numbers, since 28 is greater than 25)

Total numbers are 3 + 2 = 5

Answer: B)
