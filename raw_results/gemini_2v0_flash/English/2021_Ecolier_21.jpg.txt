Reasoning: The number of cookies must be divisible by 2, 3, and 4. This means it must be divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, and 4, which is 12.
So, the number of cookies must be a multiple of 12. Let's check the options:
A) 12 is divisible by 2, 3, and 4. 12 + 6 = 18, which is not divisible by 7.
B) 24 is divisible by 2, 3, and 4. 24 + 6 = 30, which is not divisible by 7.
C) 30 is divisible by 2, 3, and not 4.
D) 36 is divisible by 2, 3, and 4. 36 + 6 = 42, which is divisible by 7.
E) 48 is divisible by 2, 3, and 4. 48 + 6 = 54, which is not divisible by 7.
Thus, the number of cookies must be a multiple of 12 that is less than 50, and if we add 6 to that number, it shouldn't be divisible by 7. We ruled out 30. We need a number that when increased by 6, isn't a multiple of 7.
36+6 = 42 = 6*7.
48 + 6 = 54. This number is not divisible by 7.
Since 36 + 6 = 42 which is divisible by 7, D is not the answer.
A) 12 + 6 = 18 which is not divisible by 7.
B) 24 + 6 = 30 which is not divisible by 7.
E) 48 + 6 = 54 which is not divisible by 7.
We know from the prompt that only one option is true. Therefore, it is enough to pick the only choice that meets all criteria, and that is 24, when added to 6 it does not give multiple of 7.

We need a number less than 50. It must be divisible by 2, 3, and 4. So, it must be a multiple of 12. Let that number be N.
Then N + 6 is not divisible by 7.
The multiples of 12 less than 50 are: 12, 24, 36, 48.
If N = 12, N + 6 = 18 (not divisible by 7)
If N = 24, N + 6 = 30 (not divisible by 7)
If N = 36, N + 6 = 42 (divisible by 7)
If N = 48, N + 6 = 54 (not divisible by 7)
So we are left with 12, 24, and 48. However, this only eliminates option D.

But, looking at the numbers again, let's test them:
12 is divisible by 2, 3, and 4. 12 + 6 = 18 (not divisible by 7).
24 is divisible by 2, 3, and 4. 24 + 6 = 30 (not divisible by 7).
48 is divisible by 2, 3, and 4. 48 + 6 = 54 (not divisible by 7).
We need to rethink.
The wording says "...6 more cookies would be needed". Thus, (N + 6) must be divisible by 7. Let's restate it as:
N + 6 = 7k where k is a whole number, or N = 7k - 6

If N = 12, 12 + 6 = 18 which is NOT divisible by 7 (12/2 = 6, 12/3 = 4, 12/4 = 3, so 12 matches)
If N = 24, 24 + 6 = 30 which is NOT divisible by 7 (24/2 = 12, 24/3 = 8, 24/4 = 6, so 24 matches)
If N = 30, which IS divisible by 2, 3, but not 4, so this option does not work.
If N = 36, 36 + 6 = 42 which IS divisible by 7 (36/2 = 18, 36/3 = 12, 36/4 = 9, so 36 does not work)
If N = 48, 48 + 6 = 54 which is NOT divisible by 7 (48/2 = 24, 48/3 = 16, 48/4 = 12, so 48 matches)
The problem states that the cookies "cannot be divided evenly between 7 children because 6 more cookies would be needed." This means if we add 6 cookies, it can be evenly divided. 
If we read this the number of cookies *is not* an even division, and it will not be so by adding 6 as well.
However, the problem is stating that only the number of cookies must not be even, but *if 6 more are added, then that CAN be divided by 7*. 

We seek a multiple of 12.
Now let N + 6 = 7k
where N must be one of (12, 24, 36, 48). 7k - 6 MUST be one of those numbers.
7k - 6 = 12 -> 7k = 18 -> k = 18/7 -> Does not work
7k - 6 = 24 -> 7k = 30 -> k = 30/7 -> Does not work
7k - 6 = 36 -> 7k = 42 -> k = 6 -> This works! However this statement is not true
7k - 6 = 48 -> 7k = 54 -> k = 54/7 -> Does not work
Since if we need to ADD 6, 36 fails.

Now, consider they CANNOT divide evenly into 7, therefore
(N+6)%7 !=0.
So
12+6=18. 18/7!=0
24+6=30. 30/7!=0
36+6=42. 42/7 = 6. So 36 doesn't work.
48+6=54. 54/7!=0

So we are left with 12,24,48

Reasoning: Re-reading the problem statement, "however, they cannot be divided evenly between 7 children because 6 more cookies would be needed", it means if you add 6 cookies to the original amount, you *can* divide evenly between 7 children.
The problem states that 'cookies can be divided evenly between 2, 3, and 4 children', so we need to find LCM of 2, 3, and 4 which is 12. So, the number must be a multiple of 12.
We want to find multiple of 12 such that when we add 6, the result is a multiple of 7. Let N be the solution.
N = 12k, where k is a positive integer, and N < 50
N + 6 = 7m, where m is also a positive integer.
We want integer values for both k and m.

Let's check with the given options:
A) 12: 12 + 6 = 18, which is not divisible by 7.
B) 24: 24 + 6 = 30, which is not divisible by 7.
C) 30: is not divisible by 4.
D) 36: 36 + 6 = 42, which is divisible by 7. 42/7 = 6. So, 36 is the correct answer.

Answer: D)
