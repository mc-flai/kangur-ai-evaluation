Reasoning: We have the following equations:
1. B + D = 1200
2. C + E = 2100
3. B + E = 800
4. B + C = 900
5. A + E = 700

We can solve for each variable in terms of B.
From (3), E = 800 - B
From (4), C = 900 - B
From (1), D = 1200 - B
From (5), A = 700 - E = 700 - (800 - B) = B - 100

Substitute E and C into (2):
(900 - B) + (800 - B) = 2100
1700 - 2B = 2100
-2B = 400
B = -200 (This doesn't seem right.)

However, the wording "they show some mass over 1000g" means the actual weight is larger than shown.
So, the scale adds some fixed amount 'x' each time the weight goes over 1000g.
Then the equations are:
1. B + D = 1200 + x
2. C + E = 2100 + x
3. B + E = 800
4. B + C = 900
5. A + E = 700

From (3), E = 800 - B
From (4), C = 900 - B
From (5), A = 700 - E = 700 - (800 - B) = B - 100
Substitute into (2):
(900 - B) + (800 - B) = 2100 + x
1700 - 2B = 2100 + x
-2B = 400 + x
B = -200 - x/2

Substitute D = 1200+x - B.  We cannot solve this problem directly because of lack of more relationships.

Let's assume, since B,D,C,E are summed to be over 1000, that A < B, and solve. Since balls each weigh less than 1000 grams, and paired results are over 1000 grams, the scale is off.
Suppose the error amount is k.
B+D = 1200 + k
C+E = 2100 + k
B+E = 800
B+C = 900
A+E = 700

If B+C=900 and B+E=800, then C-E = 100, and C=E+100
Substituting C+E=2100+k, (E+100)+E = 2100+k
2E = 2000 + k
E = 1000 + k/2
Then since balls are each less than 1000, our error hypothesis fails.
Suppose k=0, A+E=700 --> A=700-E=700-(800-B)=B-100
B+C=900 --> C = 900-B
B+D = 1200 --> D = 1200-B
C+E = 2100 --> (900-B) + (800-B) = 2100 --> 1700-2B=2100 --> -2B=400 --> B=-200 (wrong)

Trying a different approach.
Solve this in terms of E.
A = 700-E
B = 800-E
C = 900-B = 900-(800-E) = 100 + E
D = 1200-B = 1200 - (800-E) = 400 + E
So we have A = 700-E, B = 800-E, C = 100+E, D = 400+E. Since all are less than 1000,
E < 700, E < 800, E < 900, and 100+E < 1000 (E < 900) and 400+E < 1000 (E < 600). So E < 600.
The question of scale errors now rests in C+E. We know C+E > 1000, because if C+E were correct,
(100+E)+E <=1000. 2E <= 900. So E <= 450.

If the scales added x grams: then
C+E-x = C+E = 100+2E, so 100+2E <= 1000+x, so 2E <= 900+x. E <= 450 + x/2.
Since we know the weight that tips over is likely 1200 as well as 2100, the amount that scales are adding is likely the same.
C is heaviest as C = 100+E, and A,B,D = 700-E, 800-E, 400+E.
Reasoning for why scales are adding the same amount. The scale adds an amount over 1000, so B+D-x =1200.
C+E-x =2100, and B+D and C+E weight over 1000.
Since E<600, A = 700-E must be over 100, B = 800-E must be over 200. D = 400+E <1000. And E >0.
Comparing each weight, with values subtracted
A = 700-E
B = 800-E
C = 100+E.
D = 400+E.
E. = E.

Now subtract x.
(700-E) + (800-E) = 1200+X => 1500-2E+X. A+B = 1200+x? no this does not help with this value.
Then we just solve to see which value is largest. It can't be A or B, since 100+E (C) compared to values like 700.
C = 100+E
D = 400+E.

Now from C+E = 2100+X
100+2E = 2100+X
2E = 2000 + X, so E = 1000+x/2. However, one ball must weight less than 1000 so our hypothesis falls apart.

If we say that C is the heaviest,
Assume C is the heaviest.
Then E = 800, then
