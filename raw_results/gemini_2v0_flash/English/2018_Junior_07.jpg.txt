Reasoning:
To find the maximum number of baskets Maria can fill, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of apples, peaches, and cherries.
The prime factorization of 42 is 2 x 3 x 7.
The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 x 3 x 5.
The prime factorization of 90 is 2 x 3^2 x 5.
The GCD of 42, 60, and 90 is the product of the common prime factors raised to the lowest power: 2^1 x 3^1 = 6.
Therefore, Maria can fill at most 6 baskets.

Answer: B)
