Reasoning:
The mother initially halves the cake. Then one half is halved again, resulting in two pieces that are each 1/4 of the cake. One of these 1/4 pieces is halved, resulting in two pieces that are each 1/8 of the cake. Finally, one of these 1/8 pieces is halved again, resulting in two pieces that are each 1/16 of the cake. We are given that one of these smallest pieces (1/16 of the cake) weighs 100g.
To find the weight of the entire cake, we multiply the weight of the smallest piece by 16.
100g * 16 = 1600g
