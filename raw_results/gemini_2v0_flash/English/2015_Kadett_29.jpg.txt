Reasoning: The remainder when dividing by n is always less than n. To maximize the remainder, we need to find a number n between 1 and 1000 such that 2015 is slightly more than a multiple of n.
Let's consider the number n such that 2015 = q*n + r, where r is the remainder and we want to maximize r.
We want to find n such that 2015/2 is approximately n. 2015/2 = 1007.5. Since we divide by numbers up to 1000, let's look at n = 671. Then 2015 = 3*671 + 2. So remainder is 2.
However, we are looking for a number which is closest to 2015/2, let's try to find which divisor n gives the largest remainder. Let n be close to 2015/3 = 671.66...
When n=671, 2015 = 3*671 + 2. Remainder is 2.
Consider n = 672, 2015 = 2*672 + 671. Remainder is 671.
Let n = 1000, then 2015 = 2*1000 + 15. Remainder is 15.
Consider n where 2015 = q*n + r. If we rewrite it to q*n = 2015-r, we are looking for n, such that n is close to 2015/q. r must be smaller than n.
If q=2, then n = 2015/2 = 1007.5, so we want n near 1007. Since Maria only divides by n<=1000, she would have 2015 = 2*1000 + 15, so the remainder will be 15. If we divide by some number n, less than 1007, we are looking for a number to maximize remainder.
Let's consider when the quotient is 3. n=2015/3 = 671.66. If n=672, 2015 = 2*672 + 671. Remainder is 671. This is much bigger than 15.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
To maximize the remainder when dividing 2015 by a number n (1 <= n <= 1000), we want to find an n such that 2015 is just slightly larger than a multiple of n. We can express this as 2015 = q*n + r, where q is the quotient and r is the remainder.
If we try n = 672, then 2015 = 2 * 672 + 671. The remainder is 671.
Since 671 <= 672 and 672 <= 1000, 672 is a valid divisor, therefore 671 is a possible remainder.
If we try to increase n much beyond this value, it may result in a lower remainder. For example, if n=1000, 2015 = 2 * 1000 + 15. Thus, the remainder is 15.
Therefore, the largest remainder she has noted down is 671.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: To find the biggest remainder, we want to find a divisor 'n' between 1 and 1000 such that 2015 is slightly more than a multiple of 'n'.
Let 2015 = q*n + r, where 'q' is the quotient and 'r' is the remainder (r < n). We want to maximize 'r'.

Consider when q = 2. This means n is around 2015/2 = 1007.5. Since 'n' must be less than or equal to 1000, try n = 1000. 2015 = 2*1000 + 15, remainder is 15.

Consider when q = 3. This means n is around 2015/3 = 671.66.
Let n = 672. 2015 = 2*672 + 671. The remainder is 671.
Since 671 < 672 and 672 <= 1000, this remainder is valid.

Is there a bigger remainder?
If we consider q=1, then 2015 = n + r, which means to maximize r we need to minimize n. if n=1 then 2015 = 2014 + 1 so remainder is 1. It is very small.

Therefore, 671 is the maximum value of remainder.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
We're looking for a divisor 'n' (1 <= n <= 1000) that, when dividing 2015, yields the largest possible remainder. Let's represent the division as 2015 = q*n + r, where 'q' is the quotient and 'r' is the remainder (0 <= r < n). We aim to maximize 'r'.
When n=672, we get 2015 = 2 * 672 + 671. Here, the remainder is 671.

Consider other potential values:

If 'n' is close to 1000 (the maximum divisor), for instance n=999, we can calculate 2015 / 999= 2 remainder 17
Now lets see if there are any number closer to 672 that will give a remainder close to it
If n=671 2015 = 3 * 671 + 2

Also, note that if 'n' is greater than 1007.5, 2015 can be expressed as 2 * n + something.
If we divide by 1000 2015 / 1000 is 2 Remainder 15

By comparing the remainders, we can safely assume that 671 is the largest remainder possible.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: The problem asks for the largest remainder when 2015 is divided by numbers from 1 to 1000. The remainder must always be less than the divisor. A large remainder occurs when the divisor is just slightly larger than a factor of 2015. If the divisor is half of 2015 (approximately 1007.5), the remainder would be small since it's almost evenly divided.
However when we divide by 672, the remainder is 671.
When we divide by n=1000, remainder is 15.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: The goal is to find the maximum remainder when 2015 is divided by numbers from 1 to 1000.
If n = 1000, 2015 = 2*1000 + 15; r = 15
If n is around 2015/3 = 671.66, a good choice is n = 672.
Then, 2015 = 2*672 + 671, thus r = 671
Since we want the *largest* remainder and the options A and B are too small. D=1007 which exceeds the upper limit of 1000 so can't be an answer. That leaves C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: To maximize the remainder when dividing 2015 by a number 'n' (1 <= n <= 1000), we want to find an 'n' such that 2015 is just slightly larger than a multiple of 'n'.
We can express this as 2015 = q*n + r, where 'q' is the quotient and 'r' is the remainder.
Let's test n = 672. 2015 = 2 * 672 + 671, remainder is 671.
This looks like the maximal remainder possible within the constraints.
We can verify for n=1000, 2015 = 2 * 1000 + 15 remainder is 15.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: The goal is to maximize the remainder. The remainder when dividing 2015 by 'n' must be less than 'n'. 2015 divided by 1000 is 2 with a remainder of 15. If n=672 then 2015=2*672+671. Since 671 is less than 672 and less than 1000 then this is a valid answer and probably maximal since it is almost n.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: To maximize the remainder, we look for a divisor *n* such that 2015 is close to a multiple of *n*, but still greater. Let *n* = 672. Then 2015 = 2 * 672 + 671. So, the remainder is 671.
Check *n*=1000. Then, 2015 = 2 * 1000 + 15. Here, the remainder is 15.
671 looks like the greatest possible.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: We seek the largest remainder when 2015 is divided by n, where 1 <= n <= 1000.
If n=672, then 2015 = 2*672 + 671. Here, the remainder is 671. Since 671 < 672 <= 1000, the remainder 671 is achievable.
If n=1000, then 2015 = 2*1000 + 15. Here, the remainder is 15.
The largest among the listed answers is 671.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: 2015 divided by n gives a quotient and remainder: 2015 = q*n + r, with r < n. To maximize r, we want n to be somewhat close to 2015/2. 2015/2 = 1007.5. Dividing by 1000 gives remainder 15. 2015/3 is 671.666, so if we divide 2015 by 672, we get 2015 = 2*672 + 671. The remainder is 671.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let's try dividing 2015 by numbers close to 2015/2 = 1007.5. Since we can only use numbers up to 1000, let's try n=1000. 2015 = 2 * 1000 + 15. So the remainder is 15.
Now let's try dividing 2015 by numbers close to 2015/3 = 671.666... If we choose n=672, then 2015 = 2 * 672 + 671. So the remainder is 671.
Since 671 is larger than 15, it seems like the maximum remainder is 671.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: To maximize the remainder r when dividing 2015 by n (where 1 <= n <= 1000), we can use the equation 2015 = qn + r. If n is slightly larger than a factor of 2015, r will be large.
Consider n = 672. Then 2015 = 2 * 672 + 671. r = 671.
Consider n = 1000. Then 2015 = 2 * 1000 + 15. r = 15.
Consider n = 671. Then 2015 = 3 * 671 + 2. r = 2.
Therefore, the largest remainder is 671.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: We have 2015 = qn + r, where r is the remainder and 1 <= n <= 1000. To maximize the remainder, we need n to be such that 2015 is just slightly larger than some multiple of n.
If we take n = 672, then 2015 = 2 * 672 + 671, so r = 671.
If we take n = 1000, then 2015 = 2 * 1000 + 15, so r = 15.
The largest of these is 671.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: We are looking for the maximum remainder when 2015 is divided by some n between 1 and 1000.
Let 2015 = q*n + r, where r is the remainder and r < n.

If we choose n = 1000, 2015 = 2*1000 + 15. r = 15.
If we choose n = 672, 2015 = 2*672 + 671. r = 671.
If we choose n = 671, 2015 = 3*671 + 2. r = 2.
Therefore, the largest remainder is 671.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: To maximize the remainder when dividing 2015 by some n (1 <= n <= 1000), we can use the division expression 2015 = q * n + r where q is the quotient and r is the remainder.
Case 1: If we take n close to 1000 (say 1000), 2015 = 2 * 1000 + 15, remainder = 15.
Case 2: We want n close to one of the factors. Factors are small and not useful.
We know r < n. if n = 672, then 2015 = 2 * 672 + 671. We got reminder to be 671.
Trying other nearby factor 2015/3 = 671.67. So lets check when n = 671, remainder should be 2.
The maximum is 671.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: We seek the maximum remainder r where 2015 = q*n + r, where 1 <= n <= 1000.
To maximize r, we want to choose an n where 2015 is slightly more than q*n for some integer q.
If we set n=672, we have 2015 = 2(672) + 671. So the remainder is 671.
If we set n=1000, we have 2015 = 2(1000) + 15. So the remainder is 15.
Other values will lead to smaller remainders.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: We are looking for the largest remainder when 2015 is divided by a number between 1 and 1000. When 2015 is divided by 672, the remainder is 671.
2015 = 2*672 + 671
If we try 1000, 2015 = 2*1000 + 15.
The largest remainder is 671.

Answer: C)
Reasoning:
We are looking for the largest remainder when dividing 2015 by a number between 1 and 1000, inclusive. Let's try values of n in the given range and find the corresponding remainders:
If n = 672, then 2015 = 2 * 672 + 671, remainder is 671.
If n = 1000, then 2015 = 2 * 1000 + 15, remainder is 15.
Therefore, the largest remainder is 671.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: To maximize the remainder r, we consider 2015 = qn + r with 1<= n <= 1000.
If n=672, 2015 = 2(672) + 671, r=671
If n=1000, 2015 = 2(1000) + 15, r=15
Therefore 671 is the maximum remainder

Answer: C)
Reasoning: We are looking for the largest remainder. Let's check n=672. We have that 2015=2(672)+671 so the remainder is 671.
If we choose 1000 we have 2015=2(1000) + 15 so the remainder is 15.
If we chose a number greater than 672 then the remainder must be less than 672, thus we get remainder 671 is maximal.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: To maximize the remainder, we can express the given problem as finding the value of r from the formula 2015 = q*n + r where n is any number between 1 and 1000 (1 <= n <= 1000), q is the quotient, and r is the remainder. Since the remainder must be smaller than n (r < n), it's most likely for r to be a large number, n also needs to be as large as possible such that 2015 = q*n + r holds true.
With this fact in mind, we can test each of the given options.
For Option C, if n=672, then 2015 = 2 * 672 + 671, the remainder is 671.
Therefore C

Answer: C)
Reasoning: The remainder has to be less than n. Find the value for n that maximizes the remainder. If we assume that q = 2, then we can derive n = 2015/2 = 1007.5 which is not possible since n <= 1000. Let's try 1000 as n, this leads to 2015 = 2*1000 + 15. If q=3, then n can be around 672. Let's try 672, 2015 = 2*672 + 671, hence the remainder is 671. So 671 is possible.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: We are looking for the largest remainder when dividing 2015 by n where 1<= n<=1000. 
When n=672 we have 2015 = 2*672 + 671. The remainder is 671. 
When n=1000 we have 2015=2*1000 + 15 The remainder is 15.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: We are trying to maximize the remainder. The remainder has to be less than the divisor. So if we take 2015 mod 1000 that is 15, which is a low number.  2015 mod 671 is 2, this will not work. What is a bigger one? Let's try 672 and 2015 = 2 * 672 + 671. This seems to be close to optimal as the remainder 671 and divisor is 672. 

Answer: C)
Reasoning: To maximize the remainder r in the equation 2015 = q * n + r, where 1 <= n <= 1000, we want to find an n such that 2015 is just slightly larger than a multiple of n.
If n = 672, then 2015 = 2 * 672 + 671. Remainder is 671. This looks like a large possible remainder.
If n = 1000, then 2015 = 2 * 1000 + 15. Remainder is 15.
Clearly 671 is the largest of these.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: We're looking for the maximum remainder when we divide 2015 by some number n between 1 and 1000.
We can write 2015 = q*n + r, where q is the quotient and r is the remainder. We want to maximize r. Note that r must be less than n.
If n=1000, 2015 = 2*1000 + 15, so r=15.
If n=672, 2015 = 2*672 + 671, so r=671.
The max remainder so far is 671.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: We want to maximize the remainder when dividing 2015 by a number n between 1 and 1000.

Trying values, we have:
If n = 1000, 2015 = 2(1000) + 15, so r = 15
If n = 672, 2015 = 2(672) + 671, so r = 671

Since 671 is the largest available choice, it must be the correct answer.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: The goal is to maximize the remainder. To do that we need to divide the original number by an appropriate value to get the maximum remainder. Let 2015 = q*n+r.  If n=1000, r=15. If n=672 then 2015 = 2*672 + 671. thus, r=671. Therefore, answer is 671.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: The largest remainder occurs when the divisor is only slightly larger than a factor of 2015. 2015/2 = 1007.5 so a divisor value around here might work, except we have to be <= 1000. 2015/3 = 671.66... . Trying 672: 2015 = 2(672) + 671. So, 671 is a possible remainder. If we try n=1000, the remainder is only 15, which is not as big as 671.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: We want to maximize the remainder *r* in the equation 2015 = q * n + r, where *n* is between 1 and 1000.
We can see that if n = 672, then 2015 = 2 * 672 + 671, so the remainder *r* = 671.
If we choose *n* = 1000, then 2015 = 2 * 1000 + 15, so the remainder is only 15.
Since r needs to be smaller than *n*, it seems *n* should not be too small. So 671 might indeed be the greatest remainder.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: The problem asks for the largest remainder. The remainder, r, must be less than n. 2015=n*q+r where q is the integer quotient. Thus when we divide by 1, r=0. When we divide by 1000 r=15. When we choose the numbers carefully, and let the quotient equal 2, then 2015 = 2*n+r or n+n+r=2015 or n+r/2= 1007.5. A little tricky here if the dividend ends in a non zero value. 
Try 672, 2015 = 672*2 + 671. The remainder is 671.
Since there is a specified answer to the problem, we select (C).

Answer: C)
Reasoning: The problem requires us to find the largest possible remainder when dividing 2015 by integers between 1 and 1000. The key to maximizing the remainder is to choose a divisor 'n' that is just slightly larger than a whole number factor of 2015.
Trying a divisor of 672, we get 2015 divided by 672 equals 2 with a remainder of 671. 
671 is the biggest possible remainder!

Answer: C)
Reasoning: We want to maximize the remainder when dividing 2015 by a number between 1 and 1000. Let n be the divisor. 2015 = q*n + r, where q is the quotient and r is the remainder. We seek the largest r, subject to r < n.
Try n=672. 2015 = 2*672 + 671. Remainder is 671.
Try n=1000. 2015 = 2*1000 + 15. Remainder is 15.
Therefore, the maximum is 671.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: We are looking for the largest remainder she has noted down. The remainder, r, must be less than n. 2015=n*q+r where q is the integer quotient. Let's test n=672.
Then we have that 2015=2*672+671.
If we choose n=1000 we have 2015=2*1000 + 15. If we choose n=2, we have 2015=1007*2 +1. If we choose n=3, we have 2015=3*671+2.
It appears that 671 is our best bet.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: To maximize the remainder we need to divide by a number close to half of 2015 because the maximum value any remainder can take is 1 less than the number we divide by.
2015/2 = 1007.5 but since we are restricted to divisors up to 1000 that isn't useful.
2015 = 1000*2 + 15 so that's a remainder of 15. Not good enough.
Consider the next highest value for q which is 3. 2015/3 is approximately 671.
so 2015 = 3 * 671 + 2 so our divisor has to be greater than 671.
Let's try 672. 2015 = 672 * 2 + 671. So a remainder of 671

Answer: C)
Reasoning: We need to maximize the remainder r, in the equation 2015 = q*n + r, where 1 <= n <= 1000.
We want to pick n such that the remainder r is large, which means the divisor n is somewhat bigger than a multiple. 
Try n = 672. Then 2015 = 2(672) + 671. The remainder is 671.
Try n = 1000. Then 2015 = 2(1000) + 15. The remainder is 15.
Let us try n = 670: 2015/670, or 2015 = 3*670 + 5 (remainder 5)

Answer: C)
Reasoning: We are looking for the maximum remainder when 2015 is divided by n where n lies between 1 and 1000 inclusive. 
If n=672, then 2015 = 2*672+671. Remainder =671
If n=1000, then 2015=2*1000+15 Remainder=15. 

The other remainders would be substantially smaller than the previous one. 

Answer: C)
Reasoning: To solve this, we want to find an n such that 2015 divided by n yields a large remainder, r.
So 2015 = qn + r, where q is the quotient, and r is the remainder.  r must be less than n.
Trying n = 672, we have 2015 = 2 * 672 + 671. Here, the remainder is 671.
Trying n = 1000, we have 2015 = 2 * 1000 + 15. Here, the remainder is 15.

Since 671 is the largest option provided, we choose it

Answer: C)
Reasoning: We want to find the largest remainder when we divide 2015 by a number n between 1 and 1000 inclusive.

Let n = 672, then 2015 = 2 * 672 + 671, where 671 is the remainder.
Let n = 1000, then 2015 = 2 * 1000 + 15, where 15 is the remainder.

Since the other values in the answer selection (A and B) are below that answer, 671 seems to be maximal remainder. 

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Find the maximum remainder when 2015 is divided by a number n between 1 and 1000, inclusive.

For n=672, we have 2015 = 2*672 + 671. So the remainder is 671.
For n=1000, we have 2015 = 2*1000 + 15. So the remainder is 15.

Other cases would produce smaller remainders.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: To get a large remainder, we need 2015 to be only slightly more than a multiple of some number n between 1 and 1000. We have 2015 = q * n + r, where r is the remainder. 2015 / 2 = 1007.5, so lets choose 672. 
Then 2015 = 2(672) + 671.  The remainder is 671.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: To find the largest remainder possible, we want to find a number n, such that n is less than or equal to 1000 and 2015 = xn + r where x is an integer and r is the remainder we want to maximize, where r is always less than n.
If we try dividing 2015 by numbers close to half of it, say, 1000: 2015 = 2*1000 + 15, so r is 15
If we try dividing 2015 by 672, then 2015 = 2*672 + 671, r is 671
So the answer must be C.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: We want to maximize remainder r where 2015 = q*n + r, 1<=n<=1000. Try n=672. We get 2015 = 2*672 + 671. The remainder is 671.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: To maximize the remainder when dividing 2015 by some number *n* where (1 <= *n* <= 1000), we can use the division expression 2015 = q * *n* + *r* where q is the quotient and *r* is the remainder. The condition *r* < *n* must also be true.
When *n* = 672, we get 2015 = 2 * 672 + 671, remainder = 671. 
When *n* = 1000, we get 2015 = 2 * 1000 + 15, remainder = 15.

Therefore, it should be 671

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let's try dividing 2015 by values of n close to 2015/2 = 1007.5. But n must be no larger than 1000. So let n=1000. 2015 = 2 * 1000 + 15. So, the remainder is 15.
Let's divide 2015 by values n close to 2015/3 = 671.66.... If n=672, then 2015 = 2*672 + 671, so r=671. This looks larger. So remainder=671
When choosing numbers, keep 2015 only slightly more than a multiple of it.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: Let 2015 = n * q + r where 1 <= n <= 1000, q is quotient, and r is the remainder.
The aim is to find the biggest value of remainder. Let n=1000 then 2015 = 2 * 1000 + 15, so the remainder is 15.  Also, we need the numbers to be in increasing order. The other way to get remainder 15, if we let q=1, then 2015 = 1*n + r, thus n=1 r= 2014, impossible.

Let's try 672: 2015 / 672 = 2.9985 ... so the remainder is 671.

Answer: C)
Reasoning: To maximize remainder "r" when 2015 = q*n + r, where q is the quotient and n is the divisor such that n <= 1000, n should be just slightly more than the factor. 

2015/2 = 1007.5
2015/3 = 671.66

If we consider n=672 then 2015 = 672*2 + 671, so r = 671
If we consider n=1000, then 2015 = 1000*2 +
