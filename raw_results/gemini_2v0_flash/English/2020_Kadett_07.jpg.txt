Reasoning: The goal is to minimize the square of the sum of three numbers chosen from the list. Since squaring any number yields a non-negative result, we want the sum to be as close to 0 as possible. Let's explore a few combinations:
1. -5, -3, 7: sum is -1, square is 1
2. -5, -1, 7: sum is 1, square is 1
3. -3, -1, 2: sum is -2, square is 4
4. -5, 0, 2: sum is -3, square is 9
5. -3, 0, 2: sum is -1, square is 1
6. -1, 0, 1: We do not have 1 to choose in our list.
7. -5,-3,0: sum is -8, square is 64.

Try more combinations. The combination of -5, -3, and 7 leads to -5 + (-3) + 7 = -1. (-1)^2 = 1. Also, -5,-1,7 gives -5+(-1)+7 = 1. (1)^2 = 1.
Another promising combination could be -3,-1,2 which equals to -2. (-2)^2 = 4. If we chose -5,-1,0, the sum would be -6 which gives 36 when squared.
If we chose -3,0,7, we have a sum of 4 and 4 squared is 16.
If we chose 2,0,-1, the sum would be 1 which would have the square root of 1. We could pick 0,-5,-1=-6, squared 36.

The smallest result possible is 1.
