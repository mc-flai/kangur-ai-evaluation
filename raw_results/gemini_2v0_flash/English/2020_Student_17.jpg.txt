Reasoning: Let $S$ be the sum of any seven consecutive numbers. Since the sum of any seven consecutive numbers is the same, the total sum of the 15 numbers is equal to $\frac{15}{7}S$. Let $T$ be the total sum of the 15 numbers. Then each number is an integer. Since $T$ is the sum of 15 numbers, $T$ must be an integer. Since $T = \frac{15}{7} S$, we have that $7T = 15S$. Since $T$ is an integer, $15S$ must be divisible by 7. Since 15 is not divisible by 7, it follows that $S$ must be divisible by 7. From the choices given, we see that 70 and 105 are multiples of 7.
Let's check if the options are possible. If $S=70$, then $T = \frac{15}{7} (70) = 150$. If $S=105$, then $T = \frac{15}{7} (105) = 15 \times 15 = 225$.
Let $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{15}$ be the numbers written on the wheel, where $a_1 = 10$.
We have $a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_7 = S$ and $a_2 + a_3 + \dots + a_8 = S$, so $a_1 = a_8$. Also $a_2 = a_9$, $a_3 = a_{10}$, $a_4 = a_{11}$, $a_5 = a_{12}$, $a_6 = a_{13}$, $a_7 = a_{14}$. Similarly, $a_3+ \dots + a_9 = S$ implies $a_2=a_9$. Therefore, $a_i = a_{i+7}$ for any $i$.
Also $a_i = a_{i+14}$. Since there are 15 numbers, we have $a_i$ and $a_{i+14}$ and $a_{i-1} = a_{i+13}$. Therefore, we must have $a_i = a_{i+7}$ where the indices are taken modulo 15.
Since $a_1 = a_8 = a_{15} = 10$, we can assume $a_1 = a_8 = a_2=10$. However, $a_i = a_{i+7}$ must apply to all consecutive terms.
We are given that $a_1 = 10$. So $a_8 = 10$ and $a_2 = a_9$ and $a_3 = a_{10}$.
Also, we have $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = a_2 + a_3 + \dots + a_8$.
Then $a_1 = a_8$, $a_2 = a_9, \dots a_7 = a_{14}$. Therefore we need $a_1, \dots, a_7, a_8$ to repeat twice.
We have $150 = 10(15)$. We can choose 10 for each number and $7$ consecutive sums to be $70$.
Now consider $S=105$. We have $T = \frac{15}{7}S$. Since the sum of any 7 consecutive terms is same, we have $a_1 + a_2 + \dots a_7 = a_2 + \dots + a_8$, $a_1 = a_8, a_2 = a_9, \dots a_7 = a_{14}, a_8 = a_1$. Also, $a_9 = a_2$. The sequence repeats every 7 terms. But there are 15 terms, we can assume that the 15 numbers is $a_1, \dots a_{15}$. Then $a_1 = a_8$. Since it has to be multiple of 7. Let the numbers be
$10, 10, 10, \dots$. Then the sum is $10(7)=70$.
If the numbers are the same, then we have $10, 10, 10, \dots$. But we also have $150$, which means $\frac{150}{15}=10$.

Reasoning: The sum of every 7 consecutive numbers is constant, so we have:
1) S must be divisible by 7, so we have 70 and 105
2) Let S=70. The sum of all numbers is 15/7(70)=150.
So we have 7 consecutive values sum up to 70, the average is 10. Let 10, 10, 10, ..., 10 be all values. So we have $10(7)=70$ which is consecutive. And the total sum is $15(10)=150$.
So S=70 works.
If we take S=105, the average number in the ring must be the average of the 7.

The total sum is $\frac{15}{7} \times S$. Since all the individual values need to sum up to an integer, $S$ must be divisible by $7$. Thus $49$ and $75$, $150$ are not divisible by $7$, so are invalid. Only $70$ and $105$ are divisible by $7$.
If we set all of the numbers around the circle to 10, then the sum of 7 numbers would be 70, and the total sum around the wheel would be 150. Since we are given that 10 is one of the numbers, this seems possible.

If we take 105, then the sum of the circle would be $\frac{15}{7} 105 = 15(15) = 225$. Thus 225/15=15 average.
Try 15. Could all the values be 15? Then 7 values is $15 \times 7 = 105$. But if we make one of them is 10, it cannot be done.
$10 + x_2 ... x_7 = 105.$
It seems that 70 is a possible answer.
