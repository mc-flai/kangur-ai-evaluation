Reasoning: I need to count the number of squares and triangles in each of the options and choose the one in which there are fewer squares than triangles.
A) There are 2 squares and 2 triangles.
B) There are 2 squares and 3 triangles.
C) There is 1 square and 4 triangles.
D) There is 1 square and 3 triangles.
E) There are 2 squares and 3 triangles.
Options B, C, D, and E satisfy the condition. However, I am looking for the *one* that could be her drawing and options B, D, and E each have 2 squares and 3 triangles, which is the same as the original ratio of 2 to 3. Therefore, option C is the best option.

Answer: C)
