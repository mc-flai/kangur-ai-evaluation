Reasoning:
A) 2017 -> 2710: Swap 0 and 7. Possible
B) 2017 -> 0127: Swap 2 and 0. Possible
C) 2017 -> 1027: Swap 2 and 1. Possible
D) 2017 -> 0217: Swap 2 and 0. Possible
E) 2017 -> 2071: Swap 1 and 7. Possible

Since I made a mistake in the first pass, let's try again.
We need to find the order which is impossible to obtain by swapping two cards only.
A) 2710: To obtain 2710, we would need to swap '0' and '7'. Since '1' is in the wrong spot, we would require more than one swap. It is thus not possible.
B) 0127: To obtain 0127, we would need to swap '2' and '0'.
C) 1027: To obtain 1027, we would need to swap '2' and '1'.
D) 0217: To obtain 0217, we would need to swap '2' and '0'.
E) 2071: To obtain 2071, we would need to swap '1' and '7'.

Reasoning: Swapping any two elements can only change the position of those two numbers. In option A, the digits 1 and 0 have been moved from their original locations, which necessitates at least two swaps. Therefore, option A cannot be achieved by swapping only two digits.

Answer: A)
