Reasoning:
To determine who is playing the final, we need to find the two players who have not been beaten by anyone else in the list of results. Note that this is a tennis tournament so players are eliminated when they lose a match.
-Anton lost to Bert.
-Damien lost to Carl.
-Fred lost to Edon.
-Henry lost to Glen.
-Edon lost to Glen.
-Bert lost to Carl.
-Carl lost to Glen.

Thus, Glen and Carl are the finalists since Glen beat Carl, only Glen won the tournament
