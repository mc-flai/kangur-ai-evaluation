Reasoning: The four pieces connecting the midpoints of the sides create a rectangle. Each of the four yellow regions are congruent triangles. Each triangle has a base that is half of the rectangle width and height that is half of the rectangle height. Therefore, each triangle is 1/4 the area of the rectangle. The blue area equals the area of the rectangle. The four triangles total to 1 rectangle of area. So, yellow area = blue area. Thus, the ratio is 1/1 = 1.
