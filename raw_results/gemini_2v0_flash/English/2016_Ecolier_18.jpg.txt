Reasoning: Let the age of the triplets be x. Since Franz is 3 years older, his age is x+3. The sum of their ages is x + x + x + (x+3) = 4x+3. We need to find a possible value for this expression among the options. We can check each option by solving for x:
A) 4x+3 = 25 => 4x = 22 => x = 5.5 (not an integer)
B) 4x+3 = 27 => 4x = 24 => x = 6 (an integer)
C) 4x+3 = 29 => 4x = 26 => x = 6.5 (not an integer)
D) 4x+3 = 30 => 4x = 27 => x = 6.75 (not an integer)
E) 4x+3 = 60 => 4x = 57 => x = 14.25 (not an integer)

The only integer value of x is 6, which corresponds to option B.
The ages would be 6, 6, 6, and 9, totaling 27.

Answer: B)
