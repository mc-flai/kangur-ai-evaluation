Reasoning:
Let the three consecutive positive whole numbers be $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$. Then, we have
$(n-1)^2 + n^2 + (n+1)^2 = 770$
$n^2 - 2n + 1 + n^2 + n^2 + 2n + 1 = 770$
$3n^2 + 2 = 770$
$3n^2 = 768$
$n^2 = 256$
$n = 16$
Since we're looking for the largest number, it's $n+1 = 16 + 1 = 17$.
Checking: $15^2 + 16^2 + 17^2 = 225 + 256 + 289 = 770$.
