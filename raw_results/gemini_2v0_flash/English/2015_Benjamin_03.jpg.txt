Reasoning:
The current configuration has several adjacent squares of the same color: two white squares, two grey squares and two black squares are adjacent to each other, so we need to recolor at least one of each of those pairs.
Start with the two black squares, since they are easier to visualize. One of those will need to be changed to either grey or white.
The two white squares must be resolved by changing the color of one.
The two grey squares must be resolved by changing the color of one.
So, minimally, we will need to repaint 3 squares.

Answer: B)
