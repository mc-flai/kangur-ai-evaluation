Reasoning:
Let's consider the 10 numbers to be $a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_{10} = M$.
There are exactly 5 numbers divisible by 5 and 7 numbers divisible by 7.

Let us assume that the 5 numbers divisible by 5 are $5, 10, 15, 20, 25$.
Let us assume that the 7 numbers divisible by 7 are $7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49$.
In this case, we have 12 numbers, so there must be an overlap.
The common multiple of 5 and 7 is 35.

We want to minimize $M$, so we must consider the smallest possible values.
Let the 5 multiples of 5 be $5k_i$ for $i = 1, \dots, 5$.
Let the 7 multiples of 7 be $7l_i$ for $i = 1, \dots, 7$.
Then $k_i, l_i$ are distinct positive integers.

The multiples of 35 must be included in both sets.
So let $35, 70, 105, \dots$ be multiples of both.

Case 1: Let us assume that 35 is included.
If we choose $5, 10, 15, 20, 25$ for the multiples of 5 and $7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49$ for the multiples of 7, then the remaining 3 numbers must be integers other than these. We can take $1, 2, 3$, so $M = 49$.
However, we need 10 distinct numbers. $1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 15, 20, 21, 25, 28, 35, 42, 49$.
The 10 numbers are $1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 15, 20, M$.
We have 5 numbers divisible by 5. So they are $5, 10, 15, 20, x$ and 7 numbers divisible by 7. So they are $7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, y$.

Let the multiples of 5 be $5a, 10b, 15c, 20d, 25e$
Let the multiples of 7 be $7f, 14g, 21h, 28i, 35j, 42k, 49l$

Consider the smallest 10 numbers. $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10$.
Then we have 2 numbers divisible by 5, 1 number divisible by 7.
If we choose $n, n+1, \dots, n+9$.

If $M=63$, the multiples of 5 are at most 60, so they are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60.
The multiples of 7 are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63.

The smallest multiple of 5 is 5, and the largest is at least 25.
The smallest multiple of 7 is 7, and the largest is at least 49.
Suppose the numbers are $1, 2, \dots, 10$. Only 5 and 10 are divisible by 5, and only 7 is divisible by 7.
Then M = 10.

The numbers are $a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_{10} = M$.
The 5 multiples of 5 must be distinct, and the 7 multiples of 7 must be distinct.
If we choose the multiples of 7 to be 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, and the multiples of 5 to be 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, then the numbers can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, M.
If we choose the multiples of 5 as 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35. We want M such that these fit inside.
Consider $M=63$.

The required numbers must be $5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35$.
The required numbers must be $7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63$.
$M = 63$, 5 numbers divisible by 5, and 7 numbers divisible by 7. Remaining 3 numbers can be smaller.
Then the numbers are $5, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 28, 35, 42, 63$.
Five numbers must be divisible by 5. Seven numbers must be divisible by 7.

Consider 35. The number $105 = 5 \times 21 = 7 \times 15$.
M = 75 is not divisible by either 5 or 7.

The ten numbers must be $1, 2, \dots, 10$, $a_1 < \dots < a_{10}$.
Consider 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. Then $a_{10} \ge 25$. $M \ge 25$.
Consider 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49. Then $M \ge 49$.
We need 5 values divisible by 5. We need 7 values divisible by 7.
Also we have the number 35 divisible by both.
If $M = 63$. Take the values 1 to 63. Divisible by 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 (12).
Divisible by 7: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63 (9).
We have 5 numbers divisible by 5, so the largest multiple of 5 must be large enough to have this happen.

Reasoning:
Let $M$ be the largest of the 10 distinct positive integers.
Let $A$ be the set of the 5 integers divisible by 5, and $B$ be the set of the 7 integers divisible by 7. Then $|A| = 5$ and $|B| = 7$.
Let $A = \{5a_1, 5a_2, 5a_3, 5a_4, 5a_5\}$ and $B = \{7b_1, 7b_2, 7b_3, 7b_4, 7b_5, 7b_6, 7b_7\}$ where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are distinct positive integers.
Let $S$ be the set of the 10 distinct positive integers. Then $A \subset S$, $B \subset S$, $|S| = 10$.
If $35 = 5 \times 7$ is in both sets, there are 4 other multiples of 5 and 6 other multiples of 7.
Since $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $S$, $A \cup B \subset S$. Hence $|A \cup B| \le 10$.
$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| = 5 + 7 - |A \cap B| = 12 - |A \cap B| \le 10$.
Then $|A \cap B| \ge 2$. So we must have at least 2 multiples of 35 in our set of 10 integers.
Let $a_1, \ldots, a_5$ be multiples of 5 and $b_1, \ldots, b_7$ be multiples of 7. Also $a_i, b_i$ are distinct.
We must have 5 multiples of 5 and 7 multiples of 7.
We want the smallest possible value of $M$, and the smallest such $M$ must be a multiple of 5 or 7.
Try multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35.
Try multiples of 7: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49.
If the largest number M is 63, then we need to have 5 numbers divisible by 5. We can have 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60.
If the largest number M is 63, we need 7 numbers divisible by 7: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63.

Let's try the smallest values.
5, 10, 15, 20, 25 are divisible by 5. M must be at least 25. Also, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49. M must be at least 49.
We have the numbers $a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{10} = M$.
77 could be.
77 is $7 \times 11$ and $5k$. The set of numbers that fulfill this is $S=\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$.

Reasoning:

Let $M$ be the largest number. Let the five multiples of 5 be $5a_1, 5a_2, 5a_3, 5a_4, 5a_5$ and the seven multiples of 7 be $7b_1, 7b_2, 7b_3, 7b_4, 7b_5, 7b_6, 7b_7$. All $a_i$ and $b_i$ are different.

Consider $M=105 = 5 \times 21 = 7 \times 15$. We want the smallest numbers.
35, 70, 105, are common. Need at least 2 overlaps.
Suppose the multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and the multiples of 7 are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49.
Since 35 is a multiple of both, we need 4 more multiples of 5 and 6 more multiples of 7.

If $M=63$. Numbers are $5a, 7b$ such that $a$ and $b$ are different and between 1 and 10. $5a \le 63$ so $a \le 12$. $7b \le 63$, so $b \le 9$. The numbers:
Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 (12 total).
Multiples of 7: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63 (9 total).
$M=63$. The remaining values must be small. $5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60$. Only want 5 of these. $7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63$. Only want 7 of these. So the set $S = \{1, 2, 3\}$.
Thus $S=\{5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35\}$.
Thus we can have a minimum M of 63. This implies some smaller numbers are available

Answer: B)
If we choose to numbers:
5 numbers $A={35, 40, 45, 50, 55 }$ and
7 numbers $B = \{7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 49,77\}$.

Set S contain only 10 number $\{ 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 40, 42, 45, 49, 77 \}$.
In set S 5 are divisible by 5 - 35, 40,45, 50 and $55$
Also, there are 7 divisible by 7, are
7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and $49$. Largest of numbers in 77.

If we have the sequence $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 10,14,15 \}$. Now have has 4 multiples of five with 5,10,15 and one multiples of 14 has 5
Now $x_i=x$.
Now consider all $A = ( 30/5)

77

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Among the 10 numbers, there are 5 multiples of 5 and 7 multiples of 7. Let the numbers be denoted by $x_1, ..., x_{10}$, with the largest number being $M = \max\{x_1, ..., x_{10}\}$. We need to find the smallest possible value for $M$.

Let $S = \{x_1, ..., x_{10}\}$. Let $S_5 = \{x \in S : 5|x\}$ and $S_7 = \{x \in S : 7|x\}$. Then $|S_5| = 5$ and $|S_7| = 7$.
Since we are looking for the smallest possible value for $M$, we try to construct a set $S$ such that its elements are as small as possible.
Note that $35 = 5 \cdot 7$. We have at least one common element, namely 35.

If we have M = 63: multiples of 5 can go up to 60 (12 total: 5, 10, ..., 60), multiples of 7 can go up to 63 (9 total: 7, 14, ..., 63).

Let $A_5$ be the set of smallest multiples of 5, and $A_7$ be the set of smallest multiples of 7.
The numbers must be distinct.

$M = 77$. Then 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ..., 75. Then we need 5 of those. Also we need 7, 14, ..., 77. So we have 7, 14, 21, ..., 77. We need 7 of those. The multiple of 35 must be included: 35, 70. We can use 35, 70 in our choice. Let the others be 5, 10, 15, 20 for the multiples of 5. And 7, 14, 21, 28, 42 for the multiples of 7. The remain numbers are 4 and 2. So, M can be 77.

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let the 10 distinct positive integers be $x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_{10} = M$.
Let $A = \{ x_i \in S : 5 | x_i \}$ and $B = \{ x_i \in S : 7 | x_i \}$ where $|A|=5$ and $|B|=7$.
We want to find the smallest value of $M = x_{10}$.
Consider the smallest possible multiples of 5 and 7:
Multiples of 5: $5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, ...$
Multiples of 7: $7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, ...$
35 is a common element. $S=\{1,2,3, \}$.
$M = 77, A = \{7,14,21,28,35, 42, 49 \}$ and Multiples must be less than

Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let $M$ be the largest number among the 10 distinct positive whole numbers.
We are given that exactly 5 are divisible by 5 and 7 are divisible by 7. We want to find the smallest possible value of $M$.

We can have a common multiple, like 35 (5*7).
To minimize $M$, the other 8 numbers must be less than $M$
If we pick 35 we need $70$.
Let A be the 7 numbers which divide $7$ $A=\{ x_1, x_2, .....7 \}$

Reasoning:
Let $S = \{ x_1, ..., x_{10}\}$ where $x_i$ are distinct positive integers. $M = \max(S)$
Number of multiples of 5 in S is 5, Number of multiples of 7 in S is 7.
We want the smallest M.

Final Answer: B)
Reasoning:
We are looking for the smallest possible value of M.
The 10 distinct positive integers include exactly 5 multiples of 5 and 7 multiples of 7. Thus, the union of these two sets must contain no more than 10 elements.
Thus, it cannot be an empty set.

If 5 =6543.

Final Answer: B)
Reasoning:
Let $M$ be the largest of the ten numbers. Let $A$ be the set of the 5 numbers divisible by 5, and $B$ be the set of the 7 numbers divisible by 7. Then $|A|=5$ and $|B|=7$. Also, the integers are all distinct.
Then $A = \{5a_1, 5a_2, 5a_3, 5a_4, 5a_5\}$ and $B=\{7b_1, 7b_2, 7b_3, 7b_4, 7b_5, 7b_6, 7b_7\}$ where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are distinct positive integers.
Let $S$ be the set of the 10 distinct positive integers. Then $A \subset S$, $B \subset S$, $|S|=10$.
If $35=5 \times 7$ is in both sets, there are 4 other multiples of 5 and 6 other multiples of 7.
Since $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $S$, $A \cup B \subset S$. Hence $|A \cup B| \le 10$.
$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| = 5 + 7 - |A \cap B| = 12 - |A \cap B| \le 10$.
Then $|A \cap B| \ge 2$. So we must have at least 2 multiples of 35 in our set of 10 integers. 35 *n,

So that if and other.

Final Answer: B)
Answer: B)
Reasoning:
There are 5 multiples of 5 and 7 multiples of 7, for a total of 12 numbers, of which 10 are distinct. Therefore, at least two numbers must be multiples of both 5 and 7, meaning they are multiples of 35.
Consider $35, 70$. We still need 3 multiples of 5. We need 5, 10, 15. We need five other multiples of 7. So, we need 7, 14, 21, 28, 42. So our numbers are 5, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 28, 35, 42, M. M can be 70 since 70=14 is one number we want
