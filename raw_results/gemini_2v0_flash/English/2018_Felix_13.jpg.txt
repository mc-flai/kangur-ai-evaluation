Reasoning:
Alice starts with 3 white, 2 black, and 2 grey pieces of paper, for a total of 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 pieces.
First, she cuts every piece of paper that is not black into two pieces. This means she cuts the 3 white and 2 grey pieces. So, the 3 white pieces become 3 * 2 = 6 pieces, and the 2 grey pieces become 2 * 2 = 4 pieces. The 2 black pieces remain as they are. The total number of pieces is now 6 + 4 + 2 = 12.
Next, she halves (cuts into two) every piece of paper that is not white.  This means she cuts the 4 grey and 2 black pieces. The 4 grey pieces become 4 * 2 = 8 pieces, and the 2 black pieces become 2 * 2 = 4 pieces. The 6 white pieces remain as they are. The total number of pieces is now 6 + 8 + 4 = 18.
