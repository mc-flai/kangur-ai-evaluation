Reasoning:
Let's analyze each option:
*   **(A) p x q:** Since p is smaller than 1 and q is greater than 1, the product p x q could be greater or smaller than q. For example, if p = 0.5 and q = 2, then p x q = 1. But if p = 0.8 and q = 2, then p x q = 1.6. It is smaller than p+q in most cases and can be smaller than q.
*   **(B) p + q:** Since p is smaller than 1 and q is greater than 1, the sum p + q is greater than q, because we're adding a positive number (p) to q.
*   **(C) p/q:** Since p is smaller than 1 and q is greater than 1, p/q is smaller than 1.
*   **(D) p:** p is smaller than 1.
*   **(E) q:** q is greater than 1.

Comparing (B) and (E), p + q is greater than q since p is positive. The other options are less than 1 or possibly smaller than q.
Therefore, the biggest number is p + q.

Answer: B)
