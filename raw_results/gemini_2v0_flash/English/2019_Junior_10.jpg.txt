Reasoning:
We need to find the last page number such that the digit 0 appears 6 times and the digit 8 appears 7 times.
Let's check the numbers from the smallest to the largest:
If the last page is 58:
The digit 0 appears: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. Total: 5 times.
The digit 8 appears: 8, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58. Total: 6 times.
If the last page is 68:
The digit 0 appears: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60. Total: 6 times.
The digit 8 appears: 8, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68. Total: 7 times.
If the last page is 70:
The digit 0 appears: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70. Total: 7 times.
The digit 8 appears: 8, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68. Total: 7 times.
If the last page is 78:
The digit 0 appears: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70. Total: 7 times.
The digit 8 appears: 8, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78. Total: 8 times.
If the last page is 98:
The digit 0 appears: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90. Total: 9 times.
The digit 8 appears: 8, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 98. Total: 18 times.
Thus, the correct answer is 68.
