Reasoning:
The fence is built using pieces of wood that are 2 meters long. We can count the number of pieces of wood along the length of the fence. There are 3 full pieces and 1 half piece.
The total length is 3 * 2 + 1 * 2 = 8 meters. However, there is some overlap between the pieces. Looking carefully at the picture, there are 4 pieces, which form a length of 2 + 2 + 2 + 2. = 8 meters.
There are 4 full pieces, so it should be 8.

Answer: (E)
