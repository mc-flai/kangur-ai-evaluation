Reasoning:
The problem states that Elisa left the cave at 1:20 AM and returned at 1:20 AM. This is a 12-hour period. However, the question asks the duration Elisa was outside the cave, so the difference will be 12 hours. From 10:20 to 1:20 is a difference of 3 hours. Therefore, Elisa was outside the cave for 3 hours. Also, the time Elisa left is 1:20 AM, and the time she came back is 1:20 AM. Therefore, the time duration for her outside is 12 hours which is exactly 3 hours from the leaving to the returning time. Therefore, she stayed out of the cave from 10:20 to 1:20 is the answer. To calculate the time difference, we subtract 10:20 from 1:20, which equals 3 hours.
