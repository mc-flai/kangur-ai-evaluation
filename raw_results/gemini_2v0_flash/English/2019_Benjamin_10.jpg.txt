Reasoning: The six smallest odd natural numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. Toni rolls the die three times.
The minimum sum is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
The maximum sum is 11 + 11 + 11 = 33.
Therefore, the sum of 35 is impossible.
The sum of 3 is possible (1+1+1).
To check the sum of 19, we need 19 = a+b+c where a,b,c are {1,3,5,7,9,11}. We can have 19 = 11+7+1. So 19 is possible.
To check the sum of 21, we need 21 = a+b+c where a,b,c are {1,3,5,7,9,11}. We can have 21 = 9+7+5. So 21 is possible.
To check the sum of 29, we need 29 = a+b+c where a,b,c are {1,3,5,7,9,11}. We can have 29 = 11+9+9. So 29 is possible.
