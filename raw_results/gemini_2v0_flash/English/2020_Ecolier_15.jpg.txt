Reasoning:
The kangaroo goes up 7 steps and the rabbit goes down 3 steps simultaneously. So, the ratio of the kangaroo's steps to the rabbit's steps is 7:3. The kangaroo is on step 56.
Let's find out how many "sets" of 7 steps the kangaroo has taken. 56 / 7 = 8.
Since for every 7 steps of the kangaroo, the rabbit goes down 3 steps, the rabbit has gone down 8 * 3 = 24 steps.
We know the rabbit starts at step 100. Therefore, the rabbit will be on step 100 - 24 = 76.

Answer: B)
