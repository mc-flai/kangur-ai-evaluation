Reasoning:
First, we should visualize the functions.
f(x) = 2 - x^2 is a downward-facing parabola with a vertex at (0, 2).
g(x) = x^2 - 1 is an upward-facing parabola with a vertex at (0, -1).
The x-axis is the line y = 0.

We need to find the intersection points between these functions:
Intersection of f(x) and g(x):
2 - x^2 = x^2 - 1
3 = 2x^2
x^2 = 3/2
x = ±sqrt(3/2) ≈ ±1.22

Intersection of f(x) and x-axis (y=0):
2 - x^2 = 0
x^2 = 2
x = ±sqrt(2) ≈ ±1.41

Intersection of g(x) and x-axis (y=0):
x^2 - 1 = 0
x^2 = 1
x = ±1

Now, we can sketch the graphs to determine the regions formed. The parabolas intersect at x ≈ ±1.22, and both intersect the x-axis. The x-axis intersections are at ±1 and ±1.41. The lines divide the plane into several regions, and by sketching, we can observe that there are 9 regions.
