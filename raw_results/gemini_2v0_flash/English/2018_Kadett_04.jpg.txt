Reasoning: The equation is $2 \cdot 18 \cdot 14 = 6 \cdot \star \cdot 7$. We can simplify the left side to $2 \cdot 18 \cdot 14 = 36 \cdot 14 = 504$.
The right side is $6 \cdot \star \cdot 7 = 42 \cdot \star$. We need to find the value of $\star$ such that $42 \cdot \star = 504$. We can divide both sides by 42 to get $\star = \frac{504}{42} = 12$.
Therefore, the number that has to replace the star is 12.
