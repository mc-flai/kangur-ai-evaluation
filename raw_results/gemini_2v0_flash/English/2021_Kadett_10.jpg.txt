Reasoning:
Let's denote the heights of Aaron, Byron, Caron, Darren, and Erin as A, B, C, D, and E respectively.
From the given information, we have:
1. B = A + 5
2. B = C - 10
3. D = C + 10
4. D = E - 5

From (1) and (2), we have A + 5 = C - 10, so C = A + 15
From (3), D = C + 10, so D = (A + 15) + 10 = A + 25
From (4), D = E - 5, so E - 5 = A + 25, which gives E = A + 30
Therefore, A = E - 30, meaning Aaron is 30cm shorter than Erin.

Answer: E)
