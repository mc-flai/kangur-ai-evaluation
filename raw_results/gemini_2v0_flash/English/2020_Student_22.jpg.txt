Reasoning: The triangles are similar right triangles. The bases of the triangles are 1, 2, and 3 grid units respectively. Since the height is equal to the base in each triangle, the area of a triangle is 1/2 * base * height = 1/2 * base^2. Therefore the areas are proportional to 1^2 : 2^2 : 3^2 = 1 : 4 : 9.

Answer: A)
