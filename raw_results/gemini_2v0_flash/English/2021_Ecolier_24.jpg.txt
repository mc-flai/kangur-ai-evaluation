Reasoning: Let H = weight of a hexagon, S = weight of a square, T = weight of a triangle.
From the first scale, 2H = T + S.
From the second scale, T + H = H + 3S, so T = 3S.
Substituting T = 3S into the first equation, we get 2H = 3S + S, so 2H = 4S, and H = 2S.
Now look at the third scale: 3H > 2T. We know that H = 2S and T = 3S, so 3(2S) > 2(3S) which means 6S > 6S. The scale is not balanced.
On the left we have 3H = 6S. On the right we have 2T = 6S.
So the scale would balance without adding anything to the left.
Since the scale is tilted upwards on the right side, we have 3H > 2T. We need to add something to the left.
We want to add X such that 3H + X = 2T. Substituting, 3(2S) + X = 2(3S), so 6S + X = 6S, and X = 0.
Looking closely at the third scale, we can see that 3 hexagons are tilting the scale down on the left, meaning they weigh more than 2 triangles. 3H > 2T. We need to ADD to the right side in order to get it to balance! This means that we have the wrong orientation in the scale in our analysis. Since 3H > 2T then 3H = 2T + X. And thus we can say we need to remove items from the left to balance it. BUT that is NOT what the question asks. So something must be put on the LEFT side to balance the scales.
So in the image, 3H > 2T.
3H - 2T = ?
3(2S) - 2(3S) = 6S - 6S = 0
I think there is an error in the image!
Looking closer, the left side is tilting DOWN in the picture. So this means 3 hexagons are too heavy. This is why the right side is up!
I will try to proceed assuming 2 triangles > 3 hexagons.
2T > 3H. To balance, we need to add to the left.
How much to add is ? = 2T - 3H
So we add to the left such that 3H + ? = 2T
Substituting, 3(2S) + ? = 2(3S)
6S + ? = 6S
? = 0.
Oops! Still gives the wrong result.
Let's go back to the original equation and try a different approach.
Let's assume 2 triangles require X amount of squares to balance out the scale when paired with 3 hexagons.
3H + X = 2T
3H = 6S and 2T = 6S
Therefore X = 0.

The left-hand side is too heavy. We are missing something on the right. What does he need to put on the left-hand side to balance the scales?
Looking at the answers, maybe the diagram is flipped. Let's assume that 2T > 3H, so 2 triangles is greater than 3 hexagons.
And what do we need to put on the LEFT?
Let 3H + X = 2T. We know that 3H = 3(2S) = 6S and 2T = 2(3S) = 6S.
So 6S + X = 6S
X=0

Reasoning: From the third scale, the left side is lower, which indicates it is heavier. The right side is higher, thus lighter. We need to ADD to the left side.
From scale 1, 2H = T + S
From scale 2, T + H = H + 3S --> T = 3S
Substitute T=3S into scale 1, 2H = 3S + S --> 2H = 4S --> H=2S.
The third scale has 3H on the left and 2T on the right.
3H = 3(2S) = 6S
2T = 2(3S) = 6S
Therefore, the two sides are equal. However, the diagram indicates that 3H > 2T.
Therefore, to balance, the addition should be 0 squares, 0 triangles, 0 hexagons!
The question is wrong and so is the diagram. If 2T > 3H, and let's say X = 2T-3H --> X = (2*3)S - (3*2)S,
So, 3H+A needs to be placed to counter balance the third scale. Assume 2T > 3H, so triangle is 3square. hexagon is 2 squares. Triangle is bigger. Add one triangle. 3 Hex + 1 Triangle -> 3(2)+3 = 9 . 2 triange 2 *3 = 6.
Let us test option d. Place 1 triangle on lhs. 3 hexagon is 6, 1 triange is 3. 6+3 =9. on rhs 2 Triangles are 6 so 2 t > 3 hex + 1 triangle since 6<9.
Let us test option b place 2squares on the LHS 6 + 2 is > 6 and so 2T < 3H +2S.

I will say there has to be a drawing error and choose 2 triangles
