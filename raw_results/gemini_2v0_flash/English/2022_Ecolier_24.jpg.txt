Reasoning: Let's denote the numbers under the light grey, white, and dark grey/black cards as 'a', 'b', and 'c' respectively. From the diagram, we have:
a + b + a = 34  =>  2a + b = 34
a + b + c = 32
b + a + a = 26  =>  b + 2a = 26

We have 2a + b = 34 and b + 2a = 26.  Oops, these equations appear identical - there is a typo here, as these are the same equation. Let's assume there is an error in the image and the question is solvable. The third equation is a + b + c = 32. 
From 2a + b = 34, b = 34 - 2a
From b + 2a = 26, b = 26 - 2a
If the first equation was meant to read 36, and not 34, then we have equations that can be used to solve for a and b.

Let us assume instead the question should read: the FIRST row adds to 36 instead of 34.
2a + b = 36
a + b + c = 32
b + 2a = 26, which is still correct.
From 2a + b = 36 and 2a + b = 26, it is impossible to have different results with the same variables and coefficients.

The correct approach is to use the last row to deduce what a and b is. b = 26 - 2a. Sub this result to the first row to get: 2a + (26 - 2a) = 34, or 2a + 26 - 2a = 34, or 26 = 34 - this makes the whole question unsolvable. Let's say we have 34, which can be written as 2a+b = 34. Let us instead assume b equals 26 - 2a from the third row. sub this result to the middle row to get a+b+c = 32 or a + 26 - 2a + c = 32, or c - a = 6 or c = 6 + a. The first row gives you 2a + b = 34. The last row gives you a + a + b = 26,
The middle row is a + b + c = 32.
The first and third rows can be simplified to 2a+b = 34, 2a+b = 26. Given same coefficents give you different answers, there may be a typo in the question.

Given the unsolvable nature of the question with these assumptions. Assuming typo in the question is allowed, let us change the question as we go.
If we say that FIRST row is 36, second row is 32, last row is 26. Then:
2a + b = 36; a + b + c = 32, 2a + b = 26. This is unsolvable.

If we say that last row is 36 instead of 26.
2a + b = 34; a + b + c = 32; b + 2a = 36, Still unsolvable.
There must be something else wrong!

Let's explore the numbers, 34 - 32 = 2, and 32-26=6. The difference between the third row and the middle row is 6. The middle row and top row difference is 2.

Instead of trying to solve. let's assume the numbers correspond to a, b, c = 6, 8, 10, 12, 14

If a is 6, white is 8, then 2(6) + 8 = 20, that does not give 34, 32, or 26.
If b is 6, and a is 8, then 2(8) + 6 = 22, that does not give 34, 32 or 26.

There must be something missing!

Final Answer: Since the system of equations is inconsistent, there seems to be an error in the question itself. None of the options seem to fit logically.

Reasoning: Based on the given information, we have the following equations:
1. 2 * (light grey) + (white) = 34
2. (light grey) + (white) + (black) = 32
3. 2 * (light grey) + (white) = 26

From equations 1 and 3, we have conflicting information: 2 * (light grey) + (white) cannot be both 34 and 26. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the value of the number under the black card without additional information or a correction to the problem.

Answer: None of the provided options are correct, or there may be a typo in the question. Given this, there is no real correct answer and no number shown to exist for this given riddle. The question, as it stands, cannot be computed with these constraints.

Answer: There seems to be an inconsistency in the question itself. Since it cannot be solved as is,

Reasoning: As above.

Answer: None.
Reasoning: Due to the conflicting information in the provided equations, it's impossible to determine a valid value for the number under the black card. Let 'a' represent the number under the light grey cards, 'b' the number under the white cards, and 'c' the number under the black card. We have:

2a + b = 34
a + b + c = 32
2a + b = 26

The first and third equations contradict each other (2a + b cannot simultaneously equal 34 and 26). This indicates an error in the problem statement. Therefore, it's impossible to solve for 'c' with the given information.

Answer: Cannot be determined due to the conflicting information.
Reasoning: Let the number under the light grey card be 'x', the number under the white card be 'y', and the number under the black card be 'z'. We are given:

x + y + x = 34 => 2x + y = 34
x + y + z = 32
y + x + x = 26 => 2x + y = 26

We have two equations:
2x + y = 34
2x + y = 26

Since 2x + y cannot simultaneously be 34 and 26, the problem as presented contains conflicting information.

Answer: The question is unsolvable due to contradicting equations.

Reasoning: Let's denote:
- Light grey card = a
- White card = b
- Black card = c

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1) a + b + a = 34 => 2a + b = 34
2) a + b + c = 32
3) b + a + a = 26 => 2a + b = 26

Notice that equation 1 and equation 3 both state that 2a + b should equal both 34 and 26, which is mathematically impossible. Hence, the problem contains an error, and we cannot determine a definite value for c (the black card).

Answer: The question appears to have a mistake. The values are not solvable due to the inconsistencies in the question. If we are however pressed for an answer from the choices we shall attempt to calculate which one leads to a set of numbers that satisfies the closest, keeping in mind there is a mistake.

The value for first and third row give a = 15 and b = 4 if we tried to resolve the equations. Therefore we could resolve c to be ~13. 13 is nearest to choice 14.

Answer: E)
Reasoning:
Let x = light gray card, y = white card, z = black card
From the equations:
2x + y = 34
x + y + z = 32
2x + y = 26
Since 2x+y=34 and 2x+y=26, there's a contradiction. If we subtract the two equations, we get 0 = 8, which is impossible. Thus the system of equations given has no solution. The answer must rely on assuming that only one of the answers leads to plausible solutions.
Let us proceed by solving it to minimise error.

Suppose x = light grey, b = white, d= black

2x + b = (34+26)/2 =30 on average between first and last.
Then x +b =15
b = -2x+30
b has the solution where x is less than b
We have now x + z = (32 - b)

Assume A is valid
a + b+6 = 32
Assume B is valid
a + b+8 = 32
Assume C is valid
a+b+10 = 32
Assume D is valid
a+b+12 = 32
Assume E is valid
a+b+14 =32

Solve 2x +b = 34 for integer numbers where x = light grey b = white d= black

Given the above explanation, the best explanation to work around an erroneous answer is assuming an average 30 is correct. Therefore, 16 will give a valid solution that is the closest to 15 to a.

Answer: None of the options are applicable due to conflictions within the constraints. If an estimation is to be produced it will skew and not be accurate. E)
Reasoning: Let light grey = x, white = y, black = z.
The equations are:
2x + y = 34
x + y + z = 32
2x + y = 26

Since 2x + y cannot be both 34 and 26, there is conflicting information. However, let's manipulate the equations to see if we can find a relationship for z.

Subtract equation 3 from equation 1:
(2x + y) - (2x + y) = 34 - 26
0 = 8

This confirms there's an error in the problem. However, if we proceed ignoring the inconsistency:

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:
(2x + y) - (x + y + z) = 34 - 32
x - z = 2

Subtract equation 2 from equation 3:
(2x + y) - (x + y + z) = 26 - 32
x - z = -6

This still indicates an error, since x-z can't be both 2 and -6. Given the equations we cannot solve the answer! The answers also do not satisfy reasonable values or satisfy these equations, hence it should be none.

However assuming all variables are close, the median may be assumed, giving 26 to 34 as 30/2 which will give the closest solution. 30 will yield a solution where an estimation may be extracted from given solutions, given there is a solution.

Answer: Given a math error, we attempt to derive closest solution, however unsolvable due to the constraints.
Answer: None
