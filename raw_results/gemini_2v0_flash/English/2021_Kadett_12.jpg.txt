Reasoning:
Let the weight of the jar be 'j' and the weight of the water the jar can hold be 'w'.
We are given that the jar one-fifth filled with water weighs 560 g. This can be written as:
j + (1/5)w = 560  ---(1)
We are also given that the jar four-fifths filled with water weighs 740 g. This can be written as:
j + (4/5)w = 740  ---(2)
Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2), we get:
(4/5)w - (1/5)w = 740 - 560
(3/5)w = 180
w = (5/3) * 180
w = 300
Substituting w = 300 in equation (1), we get:
j + (1/5) * 300 = 560
j + 60 = 560
j = 560 - 60
j = 500
Therefore, the weight of the empty jar is 500 g.
