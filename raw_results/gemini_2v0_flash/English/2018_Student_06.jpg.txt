Reasoning: The prompt provides the following information: 1) Some aliens are green and all others are purple. 2) Green aliens live on Mars only. Since all aliens that are not green are purple, and green aliens live on Mars only, the purple aliens cannot live on Mars (because that would mean they are also green). Therefore, since there are aliens that are not green, there is at least some other place besides Mars where aliens can live. We don't have enough information to determine if all purple aliens live on Venus, but we know that there are aliens other than green aliens. Therefore some purple aliens may live on Venus. Option E contradicts information that the prompt gives, because it says no green aliens live on Venus, but green aliens live on Mars only.

Answer: C)
