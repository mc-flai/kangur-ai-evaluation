Reasoning: Let the planned travel time be $T$ and the total distance be $D$.
In the first 2/3 of the time, David covers 3/4 of the distance.
So, time $t_1 = \frac{2}{3}T$ and distance $d_1 = \frac{3}{4}D$.
The remaining time is $t_2 = T - \frac{2}{3}T = \frac{1}{3}T$ and the remaining distance is $d_2 = D - \frac{3}{4}D = \frac{1}{4}D$.
The average speed in the first section is $v_1 = \frac{d_1}{t_1} = \frac{\frac{3}{4}D}{\frac{2}{3}T} = \frac{9}{8}\frac{D}{T}$.
The average speed in the second section is $v_2 = \frac{d_2}{t_2} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}D}{\frac{1}{3}T} = \frac{3}{4}\frac{D}{T}$.
The ratio of the average speeds is $\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{\frac{9}{8}\frac{D}{T}}{\frac{3}{4}\frac{D}{T}} = \frac{9/8}{3/4} = \frac{9}{8} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{36}{24} = \frac{3}{2}$.
