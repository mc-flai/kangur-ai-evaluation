Reasoning: The perimeter of the grey area consists of three arcs. Each arc is formed by the intersection of two circles. Since the radius of each circle is 1, and each circle intersects the others at the center of the other circles, the angle subtended at the center of each circle for each arc is 60 degrees, or π/3 radians. Thus, each arc has length rθ = 1 * (π/3) = π/3. Since there are three such arcs, the total perimeter of the grey area is 3 * (π/3) = π.
