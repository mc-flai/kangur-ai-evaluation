Reasoning:
The prime factorization of 54 is 2 * 3^3. To avoid the product of the numbers being divisible by 54, we need to ensure that we don't have both a factor of 2 and three factors of 3 in the product.
We can either exclude all multiples of 2 or all multiples of 3. Let's consider these two strategies.
Strategy 1: Exclude all multiples of 2.
The numbers we can use are the odd numbers less than or equal to 100. There are 50 odd numbers between 1 and 100. If we choose three numbers that are multiples of 3 (say, 3, 9, 15), then 3*9*15 has three factors of 3 and their product will still not be divisible by 2. However, if we include an even number, then the product becomes divisible by 2 and so 54.
In this case, the product will not have a factor of 2. If we only consider odd numbers from 1 to 100, then we have {1,3,5,...,99}, i.e. 50 such numbers. The multiples of 3 are {3, 9, 15, ..., 99}, which are of the form 3(2k-1) where k=1, 2, ..., 17. So there are 17 such numbers.
So we could exclude the multiples of 3 and use the remaining odd numbers. The number of such integers would be 50-17=33+some even numbers which would render the numbers that can be written down as smaller set. This approach will result in much fewer numbers.

Strategy 2: Include multiples of 2, but avoid three multiples of 3.
List the multiples of 3: {3, 6, 9, ..., 99}. There are 33 such numbers. To avoid having three multiples of 3, we can take at most two multiples of 3. That means we take all numbers from 1 to 100 except for the multiples of 3 after removing only two such multiples. The number of such numbers is at least 100-33=67.
The multiples of 2 from 1 to 100 are {2, 4, 6, ..., 100}. There are 50 such numbers.
Now, let's consider the integers between 1 and 100 that are NOT divisible by 3. There are 100 - 33 = 67 of these. Can we add two multiples of 3 without making the product divisible by 54?
Consider including 3 and 6. The product will be 3*6*other numbers not divisible by 3. The highest power of 3 is 1+1=2 <3. That way we cannot make the product divisible by 54. Thus we can write down 67+2 = 69 numbers in the list.

Strategy 3:
Include only numbers that are not multiples of 3 OR are not multiples of 27.
There are 33 multiples of 3 between 1 and 100.
There are 3 multiples of 27 between 1 and 100 which are 27, 54, 81.
There are 50 multiples of 2.
In this case we must not include three multiples of 3, therefore if we want to maximize the number of integers, we include all numbers that are not multiples of 3.
Therefore the numbers that can be included = 100 - 33 = 67
But if we want to include more numbers we need at most two multiples of 3, so we have numbers that are not multiples of 3 and only two multiples of 3. The number of integers would be close to 69 as in Strategy 2.
Reasoning suggests 69 is the correct answer.
