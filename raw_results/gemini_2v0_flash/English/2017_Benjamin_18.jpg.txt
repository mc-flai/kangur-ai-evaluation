Reasoning:
The number 5 has to be placed at the top right corner. The possible arrangements of the numbers are:
1. 1, 2, 3, 4 in the bottom column and 5 at top right.
2. 1, 2, 3 in the bottom column, 4 in the middle row, and 5 at top right.
3. 1, 2 in the bottom column, 3, 4 in the middle row, and 5 at top right.
4. 1 in the bottom column, 2, 3, 4 in the middle row, and 5 at top right.
5. 1, 2, 4 in the bottom column, 3 in the middle row, and 5 at top right.
6. 1, 3, 4 in the bottom column, 2 in the middle row, and 5 at top right.
We can enumerate the valid possibilities:
    5
1.  4 3 2 1
    
2.  4 3 2
    1
    
3.  4 3
    2 1
    
4.  4 3
     2
     1

5. 4 2 1
   3

I believe that the bottom left number has to be the smallest number.
    5
1) 1 2 3 4 = 5 ways

    
    
    
    
Ways:
5
4 3 2 1 - 1
5
1 4 3 2 - 
5
1 2 4 3
5
1 2 3 4 - 5
5
2 3 4 1
Thus, possible ways:
1. 12345 (1 on bottom, 5 on top)
2. 1 2 4 3 5
3. 1 3 4 2 5
4. 2 3 4 1 5
5. 2 4 1 3 5

5
6. 3 4 1 2

I think 5 is correct.
