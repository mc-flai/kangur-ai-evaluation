Reasoning: The wheel rolling along the zigzag path will have its center move in a similar zigzag pattern, but since the wheel has a radius, the path will be smoother than the ground's zigzag path. The path will also be above the ground's path by a constant radius amount. At the vertices of the zigzag, the center will follow a circular path.
Looking at the options, A, B, C, D, and E. We can see that A, B, and C have sharp vertices, which are unlikely. The only difference between D and E is the rounding of the curve when the direction changes. The correct answer should be the one with rounded edges, which is D.

Answer: D)
