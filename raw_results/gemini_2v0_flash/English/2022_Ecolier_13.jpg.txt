Reasoning:
First, we need to find the number of children in each row. Robert has 2 children to his left and 3 children to his right. Including Robert, there are 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 children in each row.
Next, we need to determine the number of rows. There are 2 rows in front of Robert and 1 row behind him. Including Robert's row, there are 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 rows.
To find the total number of children in the class, we multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows: 6 children/row * 4 rows = 24 children.
