Reasoning: The square is divided into four pieces as shown in the top-right of the image. Each piece is made up of four squares, so the original square has 16 squares. Therefore, the area of each shape that can be made from the four pieces must have an area of 16 squares.
A) The hexagon has 16 squares.
B) The triangle has 16 squares.
C) The shape has 16 squares.
D) The shape has 16 squares.
E) The shape has 16 squares.

However, we must check if each shape can be formed.
A) It looks possible to make the hexagon.
B) It looks possible to make the triangle.
C) It looks possible to make the shape.
D) It looks possible to make the shape.
E) It looks possible to make the shape.

Consider the orientations of the pieces. The most distinguishing piece is the triangle. This triangle contains two half squares, so it requires two edges to be created. By looking at the image, we can see that each piece except one has either no straight side, or one straight side of 2 units length. Thus the piece containing the triangle MUST be in the form of right triangle, where the two short sides are equal to each other, and 2 unit length, and the long side must be equal to the length of the square cut diagonally. Shapes A), C), D), and E) all have a side equal to the diagonal, which can make them look possible. But shape B) only has short sides and thus cannot be created.

Reasoning: By counting the grids, all the shapes have 16 units. But the only shape not possible is B because there is no diagonal side to accommodate the diagonal shape in one of the pieces.

Answer: B)
