Reasoning:
The problem states that all stars have a number greater than 3 and their sum is 20.

A: 7 + 5 + 6 + 2 = 20. The star labeled with '2' is smaller than 3. Therefore, A is incorrect.
B: 5 + 8 + 7 = 20. All numbers are greater than 3. Therefore, B is correct.
C: 3 + 7 + 5 + 2 + 8 = 25. But also, there's a '3' and a '2', which are smaller than 3. Therefore, C is incorrect.
D: 5 + 1 + 4 + 9 = 19. Also, '1' and '4' are not greater than 3. Therefore, D is incorrect.
E: 9 + 2 + 9 = 20. But the '2' is smaller than 3. Therefore, E is incorrect.

Answer: B)
