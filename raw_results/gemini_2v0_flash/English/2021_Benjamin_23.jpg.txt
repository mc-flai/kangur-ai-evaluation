Reasoning:
The small gear (red) turns clockwise one full rotation, which means its black tooth returns to its original position. The middle gear (purple) turns counterclockwise. The middle gear has the same number of teeth as the small gear. So, its black tooth also moves one tooth position from where it was initially. The initial tooth was pointing down. So after the first gear rotation, the tooth will point to the top left. Then the last gear rotates clockwise, where the initial tooth was on the left pointing in the upward position. So it rotates one tooth.
Therefore the blue gear turns clockwise such that its black tooth points from left upward to just upwards.

Answer: B)
