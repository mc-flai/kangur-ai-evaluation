Razonamiento:
The problem asks for the number of ways to choose 3 disks out of 5, where the order matters because the disks must be arranged from largest to smallest. This is a combination problem, and we need to calculate the number of combinations of 5 disks taken 3 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to choose.
In this case, n = 5 and r = 3.
C(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 5! / (3! * 2!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1)) = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1) = 20 / 2 = 10.
Therefore, there are 10 different towers Ana could build.
