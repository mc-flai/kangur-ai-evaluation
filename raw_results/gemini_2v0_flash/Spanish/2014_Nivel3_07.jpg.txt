Razonamiento:
Let 'x' be the capacity of the jar.
Initially, the jar is filled to half its capacity (x/2).
Then 2 liters are added, so the volume becomes x/2 + 2.
After adding 2 liters, the jar is filled to three-quarters of its capacity (3x/4).
So we can set up the equation: x/2 + 2 = 3x/4
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
4(x/2 + 2) = 4(3x/4)
2x + 8 = 3x
Subtracting 2x from both sides:
8 = x
Therefore, the capacity of the jar is 8 liters.
