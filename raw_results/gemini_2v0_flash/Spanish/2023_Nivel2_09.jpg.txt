Razonamiento: Daniela is an adolescent, which means her age is between 13 and 19. Her grandfather is between 60 and 70 years old. Their ages have the same digits. The ages of the grandfather can be 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69. If the grandfather's age is 61 then Daniela's age can be 16. The grandfather's age at the time of Daniela's birth can be computed as 61 - 16 = 45. So, it is possible that the grandfather's age at birth of Daniela is 45.
If the grandfather's age is 62 then Daniela's age can be 26, but Daniela is an adolescent, so this is not possible.
If the grandfather's age is 63, then Daniela's age can be 36, but Daniela is an adolescent, so this is not possible.
If the grandfather's age is 64, then Daniela's age can be 46, but Daniela is an adolescent, so this is not possible.
If the grandfather's age is 65, then Daniela's age can be 56, but Daniela is an adolescent, so this is not possible.
So, only grandfather's age 61 and Daniela's age 16 gives a possible scenario. In this case, the grandfather's age at birth of Daniela is 61 - 16 = 45.
Let the grandfather be 60 to 70 years old. The grandfather's age and the age of Daniela share the same digits. Grandfather's age - Daniela's age = the grandfather's age when Daniela was born.

Consider that the grandfather is 61. Then Daniela's age can be 16. 61 - 16 = 45.
Consider that the grandfather is 62. Then Daniela's age can be 26. But Daniela is an adolescent.
Consider that the grandfather is 63. Then Daniela's age can be 36. But Daniela is an adolescent.
Therefore, the answer is 45.
