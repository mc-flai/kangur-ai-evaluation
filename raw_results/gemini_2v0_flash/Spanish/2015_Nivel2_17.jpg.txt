Razonamiento: Carmen starts reading on Sunday and reads 5 pages. Then the days from Monday to Friday she reads 3 pages each day, and on Saturday she reads 5 pages. So, in a week she reads 5 + (3 * 5) + 5 = 5 + 15 + 5 = 25 pages per week.
We need to find out how many weeks it takes for her to read at least 239 pages. We can divide 239 by 25 to find the number of weeks: 239 / 25 = 9.56. So, she will need 10 full weeks.
Now let's calculate how many pages she reads in 9 weeks: 9 * 25 = 225 pages.
The pages left to read are 239 - 225 = 14 pages.
Now let's see what happens in the 10th week.
Sunday: 5 pages read. Remaining pages = 14 - 5 = 9
Monday: 3 pages read. Remaining pages = 9 - 3 = 6
Tuesday: 3 pages read. Remaining pages = 6 - 3 = 3
Wednesday: 3 pages read. Remaining pages = 3 - 3 = 0.
So, she finishes reading the book on Wednesday.
