Razonamiento:
Let $a$ be the width of each part of the shelf, which is 8 cm.
Since there are 9 parts, one is a square and the rest are rectangles.
Let $x$ be the side length of the square.
From the figure, we can observe that the length of the shelf is the sum of the lengths of three pieces.
Looking at the top row, we see that the length of the largest piece is equal to $a+a+x = 2a+x$.
Looking at the second row, we see that the lengths are $a$ and $x$.
Looking at the third row, we see that the length is $2a+x$.
Since the arrangement forms a square, the length and width must be equal. Thus, the length of the shelf is equal to its width, which is the length of the large side on the right. The length of the top layer is $x+2a$, the second layer is $x+a$, and the length of the bottom layer is $2a+x$. Thus, the length of the shelf is $2a+x$.
Since the length of the entire figure is a square, the length must be equal to the width.
Therefore, $3a+2x = 2a+x + a$, where we are adding the sides of the pieces.
We have 9 parts of the same width, and each part is 8 cm wide.
Let $L$ be the length of the side of the big square.
Then $L = 2a+x$. Also $L = 3x+2a$. Then $3x+2a = x+a+a+x = 3x$, where $x$ represents the side of the square.
Since there are 9 pieces of same width $a$, then each smaller side has length $a$.

The arrangement is:
Side length of shelf = width * #pieces = 8 cm * 9 = 72
However, one of the pieces is square.
Let 'x' be the width of the wooden plank. Since 9 pieces are used to create a big square, each of width 8cm.
The squares are formed in such a way that, they form an Arithmetic Progression.
If we look at the figure,
Side length of the biggest square = width * number of divisions
x * n = 8 * 9 = 72
$x = \frac{a}{8}$ (because the side length of smallest square = x)
So the largest strip has length $L_1$, and the side is $ L_1+x = L$. Where $x$ is the last square size.
In the picture the largest segment = side = x= 2 *8
Total number of parts along each length/breath is the
If the square occupies portion of space equivalent to smallest part
8 = 8 + length+8= 24

By careful examination of the image, the original length is 168 cm.
