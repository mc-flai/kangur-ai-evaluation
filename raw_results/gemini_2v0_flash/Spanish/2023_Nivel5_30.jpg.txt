Razonamiento: Let's trace all the possible paths to read BANANA. We can start only with the B in the top left.
- B (1)
- BA: We can move to the right or down, giving us 2 options.
- BAN: From each A, we can move to the N to the right or the N below. Total paths: 2*2 = 4
- BANA: From the 2 Ns on the second row, we can only move to the A on the third row. From the other 2 Ns on the last row, we can only move up to the A on the second row. Thus, a total of 4
- BANAN: From the As above and below, each can move to one N on the corner next to it. From the middle A, we can go to the N to the left or to the right. So, there are a total of 2+2+2+2=8
- BANANA: From the Ns we get 2+2+2+2 = 4.
So, the total number of ways to read BANANA is 4+4+8+8 = 84 if we calculate as if 2 Ns are different. But each N is the same.
Start with B: 1 option
Move to A: 2 options (right or down)
Move to N: 4 options
Move to A: 8 options
Move to N: 16 options
Move to A: 14 options
Start with the initial B.
B -> 2 options (A)
A -> Two of the A have 2 (2). The middle only have 1+1.
So, we need to be careful to ensure that we can only read the path when the new word shares the word before on the corners next to the previous word.
The number of possible paths is 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 64
Start on B(1): 1 path
A: 2 paths
N: N2,N3 : 2*2=4
A: A4, A5, A6, A7 A8 : =8 (2 from the corner N.
N
A: 2+2 +8 2*2 8 = 14
B: 1
A:2
N:4
A:8
N:8
A:8
Total:1+2+4+8+8+8

B - 1 way
A - 2 ways
N - 2x2 = 4 ways
A - 2x4 = 8 ways
N - 2x4 = 8 ways
A - 2x4 = 8 ways

Therefore: 1*2*2*2*2*2 = 32
It is not possible to get 56. The number is 84 if we can move across the path
B ->1
A->2
N->4
A->8
N->8
A->4+4 = 8 1*2*2*2*2*2 = 64/ 2= 32
1*2*2*2*2*2 = 84

Respuesta: D)
