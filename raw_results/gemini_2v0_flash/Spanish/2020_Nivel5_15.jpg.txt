Razonamiento:
Let $c$ be the number in the central cell. Let $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_8$ be the numbers in the cells on the circumference.
The sum of the eight numbers on the circumference is 40.
We have four diameters, and the sum of the three numbers in each diameter is 13.
Thus, we have:
$a_1 + c + a_5 = 13$
$a_2 + c + a_6 = 13$
$a_3 + c + a_7 = 13$
$a_4 + c + a_8 = 13$
Adding these four equations, we have:
$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 + 4c = 13 \times 4 = 52$
Since $a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_8 = 40$, we have:
$40 + 4c = 52$
$4c = 52 - 40 = 12$
$c = \frac{12}{4} = 3$
