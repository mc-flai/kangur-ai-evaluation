Razonamiento:
Let $w$ be the number of weeks that have passed.
A has 2 lessons per week, so A has $2w$ lessons in $w$ weeks.
B has 1 lesson in alternate weeks. So, B has a lesson every two weeks. Thus, B has approximately $w/2$ lessons. More precisely, if $w$ is even, then B has $w/2$ lessons. If $w$ is odd, then B has $(w-1)/2$ lessons.

We are given that A has 15 more lessons than B.
Case 1: $w$ is even. Then $2w - w/2 = 15$, so $4w - w = 30$, which implies $3w = 30$, and $w = 10$.
Case 2: $w$ is odd. Then $2w - (w-1)/2 = 15$, so $4w - w + 1 = 30$, which implies $3w = 29$, so $w = 29/3$.
Since $w$ must be an integer, we have $w=10$. Then A has $2(10) = 20$ lessons, and B has $10/2 = 5$ lessons. The difference is $20-5 = 15$ lessons.
If $w=10$, then $w$ is even and A has 20 lessons. B has $10/2 = 5$ lessons. $20 - 5 = 15$ lessons.
Therefore the answer is 10.
