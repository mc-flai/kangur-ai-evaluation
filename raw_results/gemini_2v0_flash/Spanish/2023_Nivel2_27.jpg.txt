Razonamiento:
Let $n$ be the number of consecutive integers, which is 2023.
Let $S$ be the sum of the consecutive integers, which is 2023.
Let $a$ be the first integer in the sequence.
The sum of $n$ consecutive integers starting from $a$ is given by
$$S = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a+i) = na + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i = na + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}.$$
In this case, $n = 2023$ and $S = 2023$. Thus, we have
$$2023 = 2023 a + \frac{2023(2022)}{2}.$$
Dividing by 2023, we get
$$1 = a + \frac{2022}{2} = a + 1011.$$
So, $a = 1 - 1011 = -1010$.
The smallest integer in the sequence is $a = -1010$. The sum of the digits of the smallest integer is $1+0+1+0 = 2$.
