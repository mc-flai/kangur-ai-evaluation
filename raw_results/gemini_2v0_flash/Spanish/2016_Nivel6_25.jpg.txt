Razonamiento: Let the given triangle be $ABC$, with $\angle A = 90^\circ$. Let the bisectors of the acute angles $\angle B$ and $\angle C$ intersect at point $P$. Let $d$ be the distance from $P$ to the hypotenuse $BC$. We are given that $d = 8^{1/2} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}$. We want to find the distance from $P$ to vertex $A$, which we denote by $x = AP$.
Since $P$ is the intersection of the angle bisectors of $\angle B$ and $\angle C$, it is the incenter of the triangle $ABC$. The distance from $P$ to the sides $AB$ and $AC$ is equal to the distance from $P$ to the hypotenuse $BC$, which is $d = 2\sqrt{2}$.
Let $D$ and $E$ be the points on $AB$ and $AC$, respectively, such that $PD \perp AB$ and $PE \perp AC$. Then $PD = PE = d = 2\sqrt{2}$. Since $\angle A = 90^\circ$, the quadrilateral $ADPE$ is a square.
The length of the side of the square is $2\sqrt{2}$.
The distance from $P$ to $A$ is the diagonal of the square, which is $AP = x = \sqrt{(2\sqrt{2})^2 + (2\sqrt{2})^2} = \sqrt{8+8} = \sqrt{16} = 4$.
