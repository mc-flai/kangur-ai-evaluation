Razonamiento:
Let $J$, $A$, and $L$ be the times taken by Juana, Ana, and Luisa, respectively. We are given that Ana arrives 6 minutes after Juana, so $A = J + 6$. Also, Ana arrives 9 minutes before Luisa, so $A = L - 9$, which means $L = A + 9$. The average of the three times is 1 hour and 9 minutes, which is 69 minutes. Thus, $\frac{J + A + L}{3} = 69$. Substituting $J = A - 6$ and $L = A + 9$, we get:
$\frac{(A - 6) + A + (A + 9)}{3} = 69$
$\frac{3A + 3}{3} = 69$
$A + 1 = 69$
$A = 68$
So Ana took 68 minutes, which is 1 hour and 8 minutes.
