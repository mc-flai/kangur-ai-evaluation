Razonamiento: Let the numbers in the 3x3 grid be denoted as a(i,j) where i is the row number and j is the column number. We are given a(1,1) = 3, a(1,3) = 1, and a(3,1) = 2. We need to find a(3,3). The condition is that the sum of the numbers in each 2x2 square is the same.
Let the sum of each 2x2 square be S. Consider the top left 2x2 square. Its sum is S = a(1,1) + a(1,2) + a(2,1) + a(2,2) = 3 + a(1,2) + a(2,1) + a(2,2).
Consider the top right 2x2 square. Its sum is S = a(1,2) + a(1,3) + a(2,2) + a(2,3) = a(1,2) + 1 + a(2,2) + a(2,3).
Consider the bottom left 2x2 square. Its sum is S = a(2,1) + a(2,2) + a(3,1) + a(3,2) = a(2,1) + a(2,2) + 2 + a(3,2).
Consider the bottom right 2x2 square. Its sum is S = a(2,2) + a(2,3) + a(3,2) + a(3,3) = a(2,2) + a(2,3) + a(3,2) + a(3,3).

From the first two squares: 3 + a(1,2) + a(2,1) + a(2,2) = a(1,2) + 1 + a(2,2) + a(2,3)  =>  3 + a(2,1) = 1 + a(2,3)  =>  a(2,3) = a(2,1) + 2.
From the bottom left and right squares: a(2,1) + a(2,2) + 2 + a(3,2) = a(2,2) + a(2,3) + a(3,2) + a(3,3)  =>  a(2,1) + 2 = a(2,3) + a(3,3)  =>  a(2,1) + 2 = a(2,1) + 2 + a(3,3)  =>  a(3,3) = 0.
