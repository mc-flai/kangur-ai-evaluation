### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Position**: The ladybirds start in a 4x4 grid with each in a different cell.
2. **First Whistle**: The three active ladybirds move to adjacent free cells. The possible movements are up, down, left, or right, but they cannot return to the cell they just left.
3. **Second Whistle**: The active ladybirds move again to adjacent free cells, following the same rules.
4. **Third Whistle**: The active ladybirds move once more to adjacent free cells.
5. **Fourth Whistle**: The active ladybirds move one last time to adjacent free cells.

Let's analyze the movements step-by-step:

- **Initial Position**:
  ```
  [L] [ ] [ ] [ ]
  [ ] [L] [ ] [ ]
  [ ] [ ] [L] [ ]
  [ ] [ ] [ ] [L]
  ```

- **After the First Whistle**:
  ```
  [ ] [ ] [L] [ ]
  [L] [ ] [ ] [ ]
  [ ] [L] [ ] [ ]
  [ ] [ ] [ ] [L]
  ```
  The active ladybirds move to adjacent free cells.

- **After the Second Whistle**:
  ```
  [ ] [L] [ ] [ ]
  [ ] [ ] [L] [ ]
  [L] [ ] [ ] [ ]
  [ ] [ ] [ ] [L]
  ```
  The active ladybirds move again to adjacent free cells.

- **After the Third Whistle**:
  ```
  [ ] [ ] [L] [ ]
  [ ] [L] [ ] [ ]
  [ ] [ ] [L] [ ]
  [L] [ ] [ ] [ ]
  ```
  The active ladybirds move once more to adjacent free cells.

- **After the Fourth Whistle**:
  ```
  [L] [ ] [ ] [ ]
  [ ] [L] [ ] [ ]
  [ ] [ ] [L] [ ]
  [ ] [ ] [ ] [L]
  ```
  The active ladybirds move one last time to adjacent free cells.
