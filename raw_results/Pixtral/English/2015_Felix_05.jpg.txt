### Reasoning:
Florian starts with 10 equally long metal strips, each with the same number of holes. He then bolts these strips together in pairs, resulting in 5 long strips. To determine which of the long strips is the shortest, we need to consider how the strips are connected.

When two strips are bolted together, the length of the resulting strip is determined by the combined length of the two individual strips. Since all the original strips are of equal length, the resulting strips will also be of equal length. However, the orientation and angle at which the strips are connected can affect the visual perception of their lengths.

By examining the diagram, we can see that each of the resulting strips (A, B, C, D, E) is formed by bolting two strips together. The key is to observe the angles and connections to determine which strip appears the shortest visually.

Upon close inspection, strip B is the only one that is connected horizontally, which means its length is directly determined by the sum of the lengths of the two individual strips. The other strips (A, C, D, E) are connected at angles, which can make them appear longer or shorter depending on the angle.

Therefore, strip B, being connected horizontally, is the shortest of the resulting strips.

### Answer: B
