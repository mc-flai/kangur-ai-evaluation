### Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Ferris Wheel Movement**: A Ferris wheel rotates in a circular path. Each seat on the Ferris wheel follows a similar circular path as the wheel turns.
2. **Initial Positions**: Assume Jim was initially in one of the seats labeled in the options (A to E).
3. **Ben's Position**: Ben is now in the position where Jim was before the wheel turned.
4. **Determining Jim's Current Position**: To find Jim's current position, we need to consider the rotation of the Ferris wheel. If Ben is in Jim's previous seat, Jim must be in the next seat in the direction of rotation.

### Answer:
C)
