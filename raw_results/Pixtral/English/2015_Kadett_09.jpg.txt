Reasoning: When one corner of a square piece of paper is folded into the middle of the square, it creates an irregular pentagon. The area of the square is the area of the pentagon plus the area of the triangle formed by the fold. The area of the triangle is half the area of the square. Therefore, the area of the square is twice the area of the pentagon.

To find the area of the square, we need to consider the relationship between the area of the pentagon and the area of the square. Since the area of the square is twice the area of the pentagon, we can set up the equation:

Area of square = 2 * Area of pentagon

Given that the numerical values of the areas are consecutive whole numbers, we need to find two consecutive whole numbers whose product is twice the smaller number. The possible pairs of consecutive whole numbers are (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), and so on.

For the pair (1, 2):
Area of pentagon = 1
Area of square = 2 * 1 = 2

For the pair (2, 3):
Area of pentagon = 2
Area of square = 2 * 2 = 4

For the pair (3, 4):
Area of pentagon = 3
Area of square = 2 * 3 = 6

For the pair (4, 5):
Area of pentagon = 4
Area of square = 2 * 4 = 8

For the pair (5, 6):
Area of pentagon = 5
Area of square = 2 * 5 = 10

For the pair (6, 7):
Area of pentagon = 6
Area of square = 2 * 6 = 12

For the pair (7, 8):
Area of pentagon = 7
Area of square = 2 * 7 = 14

For the pair (8, 9):
Area of pentagon = 8
Area of square = 2 * 8 = 16

For the pair (9, 10):
Area of pentagon = 9
Area of square = 2 * 9 = 18

For the pair (10, 11):
Area of pentagon = 10
Area of square = 2 * 10 = 20

For the pair (11, 12):
Area of pentagon = 11
Area of square = 2 * 11 = 22

For the pair (12, 13):
Area of pentagon = 12
Area of square = 2 * 12 = 24

For the pair (13, 14):
Area of pentagon = 13
Area of square = 2 * 13 = 26

For the pair (14, 15):
Area of pentagon = 14
Area of square = 2 * 14 = 28

For the pair (15, 16):
Area of pentagon = 15
Area of square = 2 * 15 = 30

For the pair (16, 17):
Area of pentagon = 16
Area of square = 2 * 16 = 32

The area of the square is 32, which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
