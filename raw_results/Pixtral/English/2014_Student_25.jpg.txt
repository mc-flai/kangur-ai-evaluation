Reasoning:
1. Thomas wants to write down pairwise different positive whole numbers, none of which should be bigger than 100.
2. Their product should not be divisible by 54.
3. To find the maximum number of such pairs, we need to consider the prime factors of 54, which are 2, 3, and 7.
4. The product of the numbers should not be divisible by 2, 3, or 7. This means we need to avoid even numbers, multiples of 3, and multiples of 7.
5. We start with the smallest pairs and increase until we reach the limit of 100.
6. We need to ensure that the product of each pair is not divisible by 54.

Let's consider the pairs:
- (1, 2): Product = 2 (divisible by 2)
- (1, 3): Product = 3 (divisible by 3)
- (1, 4): Product = 4 (divisible by 2)
- (1, 5): Product = 5 (not divisible by 2, 3, or 7)
- (1, 6): Product = 6 (divisible by 3)
- (1, 7): Product = 7 (not divisible by 2, 3, or 7)
- (1, 8): Product = 8 (divisible by 2)
- (1, 9): Product = 9 (divisible by 3)
- (1, 10): Product = 10 (divisible by 2)
- (2, 3): Product = 6 (divisible by 3)
- (2, 4): Product = 8 (divisible by 2)
- (2, 5): Product = 10 (divisible by 2)
- (2, 6): Product = 12 (divisible by 2)
- (2, 7): Product = 14 (not divisible by 2, 3, or 7)
- (2, 8): Product = 16 (divisible by 2)
- (2, 9): Product = 18 (divisible by 3)
- (3, 4): Product = 12 (divisible by 3)
- (3, 5): Product = 15 (divisible by 3)
- (3, 6): Product = 18 (divisible by 3)
- (3, 7): Product = 21 (not divisible by 2, 3, or 7)
- (3, 8): Product = 24 (divisible by 3)
- (3, 9): Product = 27 (divisible by 3)
- (4, 5): Product = 20 (divisible by 2)
- (4, 6): Product = 24 (divisible by 2)
- (4, 7): Product = 28 (not divisible by 2, 3, or 7)
- (4, 8): Product = 32 (divisible by 2)
- (4, 9): Product = 36 (divisible by 3)
- (5, 6): Product = 30 (divisible by 3)
- (5, 7): Product = 35 (not divisible by 2, 3, or 7)
- (5, 8): Product = 40 (divisible by 2)
- (5, 9): Product = 45 (divisible by 3)
- (6, 7): Product = 42 (divisible by 3)
- (6, 8): Product = 48 (divisible by 2)
- (6, 9): Product = 54 (divisible by 2, 3, and 7)
- (7, 8): Product = 56 (divisible by 2)
- (7, 9): Product = 63 (divisible by 3)
- (8, 9): Product = 72 (divisible by 2 and 3)

Continuing this process, we find that the maximum number of pairs that satisfy the conditions is 17.
