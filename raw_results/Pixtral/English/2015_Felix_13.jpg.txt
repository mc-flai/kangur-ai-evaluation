### Reasoning:
The image shows a pattern of triangular pieces arranged in a larger triangular grid. Each triangular piece has a specific design. The task is to identify which triangular piece completes the pattern where a piece is missing.

To solve this, we need to observe the pattern and identify the design elements that are repeated or mirrored across the grid. The missing piece should fit seamlessly into the grid, maintaining the pattern's continuity.

Upon examining the grid, we notice that the pieces around the missing piece have specific designs. The piece directly above the missing piece has a design that is mirrored in the piece directly below it. This suggests that the missing piece should have a design that mirrors the piece above it.

By comparing the options (A) to (E), we look for the piece that mirrors the design of the piece directly above the missing piece. The correct piece will have a design that fits this criteria.

C
