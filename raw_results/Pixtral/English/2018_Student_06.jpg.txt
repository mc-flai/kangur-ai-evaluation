### Reasoning:
1. We are given two statements:
   - Some aliens are green and all others are purple.
   - Green aliens live on Mars only.

2. From the first statement, we know that there are both green and purple aliens, but the second statement specifies that green aliens live only on Mars.

3. Since green aliens are the only ones living on Mars, it means that purple aliens do not live on Mars.

4. The statements do not provide any information about where purple aliens live, but they do confirm that green aliens are exclusively on Mars.

5. Therefore, we can conclude that there are no green aliens on any planet other than Mars.

### Answer: E) There are no green aliens on Venus.
