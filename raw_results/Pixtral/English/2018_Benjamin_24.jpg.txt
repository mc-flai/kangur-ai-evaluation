Reasoning: The figure consists of one square part and eight rectangular parts, all of which are 8 cm wide. To find the total length of the rectangle formed by assembling all parts, we need to consider the arrangement of these parts.

1. The square part has a side length equal to its width, which is 8 cm.
2. Each of the eight rectangular parts has a width of 8 cm.
3. By arranging these parts to form a long rectangle, we need to count the total number of 8 cm units along the length.

From the image, it appears that the parts are arranged in such a way that the total length includes the square and the rectangles. The arrangement suggests that the length is composed of the sum of the individual parts' lengths.

4. Counting the units along the length, we have:
   - One square of 8 cm
   - Eight rectangles of 8 cm each

Total length = 1 (square) + 8 (rectangles) = 9 units of 8 cm each

Total length = 9 * 8 cm = 72 cm

However, this calculation does not match any of the given options, indicating a possible misinterpretation of the arrangement or a need to re-evaluate the configuration.

Upon closer inspection, the correct interpretation involves summing the individual parts' contributions to the total length, considering overlaps and the specific arrangement shown in the figure.

Final calculation:
- The arrangement shows a total of 11 units of 8 cm each (considering overlaps and specific placements).

Total length = 11 * 8 cm = 88 cm

This still does not match any of the given options, suggesting a need to re-evaluate the arrangement or consider additional factors.

Answer: None of the given options correctly represent the total length based on the described arrangement and calculations.
