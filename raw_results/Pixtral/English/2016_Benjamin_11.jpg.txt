Reasoning:
1. Mona works three times per week.
2. Asma works four times per week.
3. Together, Mona and Asma work seven times per week (3 + 4 = 7).
4. Since exactly two of them are working each day, and there are five working days in a week, they must cover all the days.
5. Therefore, the total number of days covered by Mona and Asma is 10 (2 days * 5 days = 10 days).
6. To cover 10 days with Mona and Asma working 7 times in total, they must overlap on some days.
7. Let's calculate the number of days they overlap:
   - If they overlap on 1 day, they would work 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 days (Mona) + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 days (Asma), totaling 6 days.
   - If they overlap on 2 days, they would work 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 days (Mona) + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 days (Asma), totaling 6 days.
   - If they overlap on 3 days, they would work 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 days (Mona) + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 days (Asma), totaling 6 days.
   - If they overlap on 4 days, they would work 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 days (Mona) + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 days (Asma), totaling 6 days.
   - If they overlap on 5 days, they would work 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 days (Mona) + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 days (Asma), totaling 6 days.
8. Since they need to cover 10 days, and the overlap must be 5 days to achieve this, Nadja must work on the remaining days.
9. Therefore, Nadja works on the days when Mona and Asma do not work, which is 3 days per week.
