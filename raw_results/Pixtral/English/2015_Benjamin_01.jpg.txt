### Reasoning:
To determine which shape has exactly one half colored grey, we need to examine each option carefully:

- **Option (A)**: This is a circle divided into three equal parts. Only one of the three parts is grey, which means less than half of the circle is grey.
- **Option (B)**: This is a triangle with one grey side. Since it is a triangle, having one grey side means more than half is grey.
- **Option (C)**: This is a square divided into four parts. Two of the parts are grey, which means more than half of the square is grey.
- **Option (D)**: This is a square divided diagonally. One half of the square is grey, which meets the requirement.
- **Option (E)**: This is a pentagon with some grey areas. It is not clear if exactly half is grey just by visual inspection.

Based on the above analysis, the shape that has exactly one half colored grey is option (D).

### Answer: D
