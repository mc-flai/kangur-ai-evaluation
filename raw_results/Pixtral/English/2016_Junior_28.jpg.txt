**Reasoning:**
1. We know that the person who skis sits to the left of Sandra.
2. The person who ice skates sits opposite Benjamin.
3. Eva and Philipp sit next to each other.
4. A woman sits next to the person who plays hockey.

From these clues, let's determine the seating arrangement:
- If the person who skis is to the left of Sandra, then Sandra is not the one who skis.
- The person who ice skates is opposite Benjamin, so Benjamin is not the one who ice skates.
- Eva and Philipp sit next to each other, so they cannot be the ones who ice skate or ski since they are not opposite each other.
- A woman sits next to the person who plays hockey, which means the person who plays hockey is either Eva, Philipp, or Sandra.

Since Eva and Philipp sit next to each other, they must be either skiing or playing hockey. Given that a woman sits next to the person who plays hockey, and Sandra is not the one who skis, Sandra must be the one who plays hockey. Therefore, Eva and Philipp must be the ones who ski.

**Answer:** B) Skiing
