### Reasoning:
1. The problem states that Benjamin owns a 2 cm high model of his brother in H0-scale, which has a ratio of 1:87.
2. To find the real height of Benjamin's brother, we need to set up a proportion using the scale ratio.
3. The scale ratio is 1:87, meaning 1 cm in the model represents 87 cm in reality.
4. Benjamin's model is 2 cm high, so we multiply by 87 to find the real height.

Calculation:
\[ \text{Real height} = 2 \text{ cm} \times 87 = 174 \text{ cm} \]
