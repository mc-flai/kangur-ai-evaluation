Reasoning: Let's denote the total number of kangaroos in the group as N. According to the problem, the two lightest kangaroos weigh 25% of the total weight of the group, and the three heaviest kangaroos weigh 60% of the total weight. This means that the remaining kangaroos (N - 5) weigh the remaining 15% of the total weight (since 100% - 25% - 60% = 15%).

To find the total number of kangaroos, we need to consider the distribution of weights. The two lightest and the three heaviest kangaroos account for 85% of the total weight (25% + 60%). The remaining kangaroos must account for the remaining 15% of the total weight. Since the three heaviest kangaroos weigh more than the two lightest, we can assume that the remaining kangaroos (N - 5) must be fewer in number to account for the smaller percentage of the total weight.

Given the options, we need to find a number that fits this scenario. Let's evaluate each option:

- Option A) 6: If there are 6 kangaroos, the two lightest and three heaviest would account for 5 kangaroos, leaving 1 kangaroo to account for 15% of the total weight, which is not feasible.
- Option B) 7: If there are 7 kangaroos, the two lightest and three heaviest would account for 5 kangaroos, leaving 2 kangaroos to account for 15% of the total weight, which is still not feasible.
- Option C) 8: If there are 8 kangaroos, the two lightest and three heaviest would account for 5 kangaroos, leaving 3 kangaroos to account for 15% of the total weight, which is still not feasible.
- Option D) 15: If there are 15 kangaroos, the two lightest and three heaviest would account for 5 kangaroos, leaving 10 kangaroos to account for 15% of the total weight, which is feasible.
- Option E) 20: If there are 20 kangaroos, the two lightest and three heaviest would account for 5 kangaroos, leaving 15 kangaroos to account for 15% of the total weight, which is also feasible.

Given the options, the most feasible number of kangaroos that fits the scenario is 15.

Answer: D)
