### Reasoning:
1. The diagram consists of three squares, each with a side length of 1.
2. The midpoint of the topmost square is exactly above the common side of the two other squares.
3. To find the area of the grey section, we need to consider the geometry of the squares and the triangle formed by the overlap.

First, let's visualize the arrangement:
- The bottom two squares are aligned side by side, each occupying a space of 1x1.
- The top square is placed such that its midpoint is directly above the common side of the bottom two squares.

The grey section is a right triangle formed by the overlap of the top square with the bottom squares. The base of this triangle is the side of the square (1 unit), and the height is half the side of the square (0.5 units).

The area of a right triangle is given by:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 0.5 = \frac{1}{4} \]
