To determine the area of one of the rectangles, we need to consider the arrangement of the 14.5 congruent rectangles within a square of side length 24 cm.

First, let's calculate the total area of the square:
\[ \text{Area of the square} = 24 \text{ cm} \times 24 \text{ cm} = 576 \text{ cm}^2 \]

Since there are 14.5 congruent rectangles, the total area occupied by these rectangles is equal to the area of the square:
\[ \text{Total area of rectangles} = 576 \text{ cm}^2 \]

Each rectangle has the same area, so we divide the total area by the number of rectangles:
\[ \text{Area of one rectangle} = \frac{576 \text{ cm}^2}{14.5} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ \text{Area of one rectangle} = \frac{576}{14.5} \approx 39.93 \text{ cm}^2 \]

The closest given option to 39.93 cm² is 32 cm².

Reasoning: The total area of the square is 576 cm², and there are 14.5 congruent rectangles. Dividing the total area by the number of rectangles gives the area of one rectangle, which is approximately 39.93 cm².
