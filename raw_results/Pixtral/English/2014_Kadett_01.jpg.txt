### Reasoning:
The Mathematical Kangaroo takes place each year on the third Thursday of March. To determine the latest possible date for this event, we need to identify the latest day of the week that March 1 can fall on and then calculate the corresponding date for the third Thursday.

March 1 can fall on any day of the week, but if it falls on a Sunday, it will be the latest possible day for the third Thursday to occur. This is because moving forward three weeks from a Sunday will result in another Sunday, and the third Thursday will be the latest possible occurrence within the month.

If March 1 is a Sunday, then:
- March 7 is the first Thursday.
- March 14 is the second Thursday.
- March 21 is the third Thursday.

Therefore, the latest possible date for the Mathematical Kangaroo to take place is March 21.

### Answer: D) 21 March
