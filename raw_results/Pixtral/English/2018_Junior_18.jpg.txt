### Reasoning:

The problem asks how often the summand \(2018^2\) appears under the root in the equation:

\[
\sqrt{2018^2 + 2018^2 + ... + 2018^2} = 2018^{10}
\]

First, let's simplify the left-hand side of the equation:

\[
\sqrt{2018^2 + 2018^2 + ... + 2018^2} = \sqrt{n \cdot 2018^2}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\sqrt{n \cdot 2018^2} = 2018 \sqrt{n}
\]

For the equation \(2018 \sqrt{n} = 2018^{10}\) to hold true, \(\sqrt{n}\) must equal \(2018^9\):

\[
\sqrt{n} = 2018^9
\]

Squaring both sides gives:

\[
n = (2018^9)^2 = 2018^{18}
\]

Therefore, the number of summands \(n\) is \(2018^{18}\).
