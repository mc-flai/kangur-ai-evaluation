### Reasoning:
1. We need to find two three-digit numbers using six different digits.
2. The first digit of the second number must be twice as large as the last digit of the first number.
3. The smallest possible sum of the two numbers should be determined.

Let's consider the options given:
- (A) 301
- (B) 535
- (C) 537
- (D) 546
- (E) 552

We need to find pairs of numbers where the first digit of the second number is twice the last digit of the first number.

- For 301, the last digit is 1. Twice 1 is 2. The smallest number with 2 as the first digit is 200, which is not a valid option.
- For 535, the last digit is 5. Twice 5 is 10, which is not a valid digit for the first digit of a three-digit number.
- For 537, the last digit is 7. Twice 7 is 14, which is not a valid digit for the first digit of a three-digit number.
- For 546, the last digit is 6. Twice 6 is 12, which is not a valid digit for the first digit of a three-digit number.
- For 552, the last digit is 2. Twice 2 is 4. The smallest number with 4 as the first digit is 400, which is not a valid option.

None of the given options satisfy the condition that the first digit of the second number is twice as large as the last digit of the first number.

### Answer:
None of the given options (A, B, C, D, E) satisfy the condition.
