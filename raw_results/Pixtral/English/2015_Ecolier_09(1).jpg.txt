Reasoning: Initially, Luis has 7 apples and 2 bananas. He gives 2 apples to Jacob, so he is left with 5 apples. Jacob gives bananas in return, and after the exchange, Luis has the same amount of apples as bananas. Let's denote the number of bananas Luis gets from Jacob as x. After the exchange, Luis will have 5 + x apples and 2 + x bananas. According to the problem, these quantities are equal:
5 + x = 2 + x
To solve for x, subtract x from both sides:
5 = 2
This equation does not make sense, indicating a mistake in the initial assumption. Re-evaluating the problem, we realize that Luis starts with 2 bananas and gives all of them to Jacob. Jacob then gives back bananas to Luis. Since Luis ends up with the same amount of apples as bananas, and he initially had 7 apples, he must have received 7 bananas from Jacob.

Answer: E)
