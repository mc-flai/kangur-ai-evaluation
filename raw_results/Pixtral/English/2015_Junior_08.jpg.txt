### Reasoning:

To determine which number is neither a square nor a cubic number, we need to check each option:

- **A) \(6^{13}\)**:
  - \(6^{13}\) is a perfect power, and since 6 is not a perfect square or perfect cube, it is not a square or a cubic number.

- **B) \(5^{12}\)**:
  - \(5^{12}\) is a perfect power, and since 5 is not a perfect square or perfect cube, it is not a square or a cubic number.

- **C) \(4^{11}\)**:
  - \(4^{11}\) is a perfect power, and since 4 is a perfect square (2 squared), it is a square number but not a cubic number.

- **D) \(3^{10}\)**:
  - \(3^{10}\) is a perfect power, and since 3 is not a perfect square or perfect cube, it is not a square or a cubic number.

- **E) \(2^{9}\)**:
  - \(2^{9}\) is a perfect power, and since 2 is a perfect square (3 squared), it is a square number but not a cubic number.

### Answer: E)
