### Reasoning:

When a wheel rolls along a zigzag curve, the path described by the center of the wheel is typically a smoother curve that follows the general shape of the zigzag but without the sharp corners. The center of the wheel will trace a path that is more continuous and less angular than the actual zigzag path.

Let's analyze each option:

- **Option (A):** This path has sharp corners and does not appear smooth. It seems to follow the zigzag path closely, which is not what the center of the wheel would do.
- **Option (B):** This path is also quite angular and does not show a smooth curve. It follows the zigzag path too closely.
- **Option (C):** This path is smoother and more continuous, following the general shape of the zigzag but without the sharp corners. This is likely the path described by the center of the wheel.
- **Option (D):** This path is smoother but still has some sharp changes in direction. It does not follow the zigzag path as closely as options A and B but is not as smooth as option C.
- **Option (E):** This path is quite similar to option D, with some sharp changes in direction. It is not as smooth as option C.

Based on this analysis, the path that best represents the curve described by the center of the wheel is option C.
