### Reasoning:
1. We need to ensure that the sum of the three numbers in the horizontal row is equal to the sum of the three numbers in the vertical column.
2. Let's denote the middle square as \( x \).
3. The possible numbers to be placed in the squares are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9.
4. We need to find a combination where the sum of the horizontal row equals the sum of the vertical column.

Let's consider the possible combinations:
- Horizontal row: \( a, x, b \)
- Vertical column: \( c, x, d \)

We need \( a + x + b = c + x + d \).

Let's try different values for \( x \) and check the sums:

- If \( x = 1 \):
  - Horizontal sum: \( a + 1 + b \)
  - Vertical sum: \( c + 1 + d \)
  - We need \( a + 1 + b = c + 1 + d \) which simplifies to \( a + b = c + d \).

- If \( x = 2 \):
  - Horizontal sum: \( a + 2 + b \)
  - Vertical sum: \( c + 2 + d \)
  - We need \( a + 2 + b = c + 2 + d \) which simplifies to \( a + b = c + d \).

- If \( x = 3 \):
  - Horizontal sum: \( a + 3 + b \)
  - Vertical sum: \( c + 3 + d \)
  - We need \( a + 3 + b = c + 3 + d \) which simplifies to \( a + b = c + d \).

- If \( x = 4 \):
  - Horizontal sum: \( a + 4 + b \)
  - Vertical sum: \( c + 4 + d \)
  - We need \( a + 4 + b = c + 4 + d \) which simplifies to \( a + b = c + d \).

- If \( x = 9 \):
  - Horizontal sum: \( a + 9 + b \)
  - Vertical sum: \( c + 9 + d \)
  - We need \( a + 9 + b = c + 9 + d \) which simplifies to \( a + b = c + d \).

Given the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9, we need to find a combination where the sums match. Let's try placing the numbers:

- Horizontal row: 1, 9, 4
- Vertical column: 2, 9, 3

Check the sums:
- Horizontal sum: \( 1 + 9 + 4 = 14 \)
- Vertical sum: \( 2 + 9 + 3 = 14 \)

Both sums are equal.

### Answer:
E) 9
