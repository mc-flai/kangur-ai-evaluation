### Reasoning:
1. Tick, Trick, and Track are triplets, which means they are all the same age.
2. Their brother Franz is exactly 3 years older than the triplets.
3. Since all four children are having their birthdays today, the age of the triplets is the same as their age today.
4. Let's denote the age of the triplets as \( x \). Therefore, Franz's age is \( x + 3 \).
5. We need to find a combination of ages for the four brothers that sums up to one of the given options.

Let's consider the possible ages:
- If the triplets are 6 years old, then Franz is 9 years old.
- The sum of their ages would be \( 6 + 6 + 6 + 9 = 27 \).

Checking the options:
- (A) 25: This sum is not possible with the given ages.
- (B) 27: This sum is possible with the triplets being 6 years old and Franz being 9 years old.
- (C) 29: This sum is not possible with the given ages.
- (D) 30: This sum is not possible with the given ages.
- (E) 60: This sum is not possible with the given ages.

### Answer: B
