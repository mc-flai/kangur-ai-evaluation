Reasoning: To determine how many girls ate two muffins, we need to consider the average consumption and the constraints given. The average number of muffins eaten by the twelve girls is 1.5. This means the total number of muffins eaten by all the girls combined is 12 * 1.5 = 18 muffins. We know that two girls ate nothing, so they did not contribute to the total muffin count. Therefore, the remaining ten girls ate all 18 muffins. Since none of the girls ate more than two muffins, the maximum number of muffins any girl could eat is two. To find out how many girls ate two muffins, we need to distribute the 18 muffins among the ten girls such that no girl eats more than two muffins. If we assume that the minimum number of muffins eaten by each of the ten girls is one, then the remaining muffins would be 18 - 10 = 8 muffins. These 8 muffins must be eaten by the girls who ate two muffins each. Therefore, the number of girls who ate two muffins is 8.
