Reasoning: To find the shortest path from "Start" to "Ziel" on a grid of squares with side lengths of 1, we need to consider the most direct route. Moving along the sides and diagonals of the squares, the shortest path will be a straight line from the starting point to the target point. Since the grid is a 3x3 grid, the shortest path will be a diagonal from one corner to the opposite corner.

Steps:
1. Identify the starting point and the target point.
2. Determine the number of squares the path must cross diagonally.
3. Calculate the total distance covered by the diagonal path.

The grid is 3x3, so the shortest path will be a diagonal from one corner to the opposite corner, crossing through two squares diagonally.

Distance calculation:
- The diagonal of a square with side length 1 can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: diagonal = √(side^2 + side^2) = √(1^2 + 1^2) = √2.
- The total distance for the diagonal path crossing through two squares is 2 * √2.
