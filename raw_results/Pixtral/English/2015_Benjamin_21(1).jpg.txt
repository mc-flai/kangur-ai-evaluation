### Reasoning:
To solve this problem, we need to determine which square(s) can be removed from the net so that the remaining 6 squares can still form a cube. A cube has 6 faces, and each face must be connected to at least one other face. By examining the net, we can see which square(s) can be removed without disconnecting the remaining squares.

1. Square 1 is connected to squares 2 and 3.
2. Square 2 is connected to squares 1, 3, and 5.
3. Square 3 is connected to squares 1, 2, and 6.
4. Square 4 is connected to squares 5 and 7.
5. Square 5 is connected to squares 2, 4, and 6.
6. Square 6 is connected to squares 3 and 5.
7. Square 7 is connected to squares 4 and 5.

If we remove square 4, the remaining squares (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7) are still connected and can form a cube. Removing any other single square would disconnect the net, making it impossible to form a cube.
