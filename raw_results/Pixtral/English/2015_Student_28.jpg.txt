### Reasoning:
1. We know that there are a total of 7 squares, all of which are blue.
2. There are more red rectangles than blue squares by 3.
3. There are also two more red squares than blue rectangles.
4. Let's denote the number of blue rectangles as B.
5. Since there are 7 blue squares, the number of red squares is B + 2.
6. The total number of red rectangles is B + 3.
7. The total number of rectangles (both red and blue) is 7 (blue squares) + B (blue rectangles) + (B + 3) (red rectangles) + (B + 2) (red squares).
8. The total number of shapes (both squares and rectangles) is 7 (blue squares) + B (blue rectangles) + (B + 3) (red rectangles) + (B + 2) (red squares).
9. We know that 7 of the rectangles are squares, so the total number of rectangles is 7 + B + (B + 3) + (B + 2).
10. Simplifying, we get 7 + B + B + 3 + B + 2 = 2B + 12.
11. The total number of shapes is 7 (blue squares) + 2B (rectangles) + 12 = 2B + 19.
12. We know that the total number of shapes is 12 (since there are 7 blue squares and 5 blue rectangles).
13. Therefore, 2B + 19 = 12.
14. Solving for B, we get 2B = 12 - 19 = -7, which is not possible.
15. Rechecking the problem, we realize that the total number of shapes should be 19 (7 blue squares + 5 blue rectangles + 7 red rectangles).
16. Therefore, 2B + 19 = 19.
17. Solving for B, we get 2B = 19 - 19 = 0.
18. Thus, B = 0.
