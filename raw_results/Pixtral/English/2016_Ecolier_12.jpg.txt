### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to identify which piece fits in the middle of a big diagram by connecting light-grey lines with light-grey lines, dark-grey lines with dark-grey lines, and black lines with black lines. This means we need to observe the pattern of lines in each piece and match it with the pattern in the big diagram.

1. **Piece A**: This piece has light-grey lines connecting to light-grey lines, dark-grey lines connecting to dark-grey lines, and black lines connecting to black lines. This matches the given rule.
2. **Piece B**: This piece has light-grey lines connecting to light-grey lines and dark-grey lines connecting to dark-grey lines, but the black lines are not connected to black lines. This does not match the given rule.
3. **Piece C**: This piece has light-grey lines connecting to light-grey lines, dark-grey lines connecting to dark-grey lines, and black lines connecting to black lines. This matches the given rule.
4. **Piece D**: This piece has light-grey lines connecting to light-grey lines, dark-grey lines connecting to dark-grey lines, and black lines connecting to black lines. This matches the given rule.
5. **Piece E**: This piece has light-grey lines connecting to light-grey lines, dark-grey lines connecting to dark-grey lines, and black lines connecting to black lines. This matches the given rule.

Since pieces A, C, D, and E all match the given rule, we need to determine which one fits best in the middle of the big diagram by visual inspection.

### Answer: E
