### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Daniela fills a 3x3 table with digits 1 to 9 such that each field contains only one digit.
   - Two numbers are "adjacent" if they share a side.
   - The sum of the numbers adjacent to 5 is given as 9.
   - We need to find the sum of the numbers adjacent to 6.

2. **Analyzing the Given Information**:
   - The digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 are already placed in the table.
   - The sum of the numbers adjacent to 5 is 9.

3. **Determining the Numbers Adjacent to 5**:
   - Let's denote the numbers adjacent to 5 as A, B, and C.
   - Since the sum of A, B, and C is 9, and the possible digits are from 1 to 9, we need to find a combination that sums to 9.
   - Possible combinations: (1, 3, 5) or (2, 3, 4).

4. **Placing the Numbers in the Table**:
   - Given the partial table:
     ```
     [ ] [ ] [ ]
     [ ] 5 [ ]
     [ ] [ ] [ ]
     ```
   - We need to place the numbers such that their sum is 9.
   - If we place 1, 3, and 5 around 5, the table looks like this:
     ```
     [1] [ ] [ ]
     [ ] 5 [ ]
     [ ] [3] [5]
     ```
   - This does not satisfy the condition as 1, 3, and 5 are not adjacent.
   - If we place 2, 3, and 4 around 5, the table looks like this:
     ```
     [ ] [ ] [ ]
     [2] 5 [ ]
     [ ] [3] [4]
     ```
   - This satisfies the condition as 2, 3, and 4 are adjacent to 5.

5. **Finding the Numbers Adjacent to 6**:
   - Now, we need to determine the numbers adjacent to 6.
   - The remaining digits are 6, 7, 8, and 9.
   - We need to place these numbers in the remaining fields such that 6 is adjacent to three numbers.

6. **Possible Combinations for Numbers Adjacent to 6**:
   - Let's denote the numbers adjacent to 6 as D, E, and F.
   - Possible combinations: (7, 8, 9) or (8, 9, 1).

7. **Placing the Numbers in the Table**:
   - If we place 7, 8, and 9 around 6, the table looks like this:
     ```
     [ ] [ ] [ ]
     [7] 6 [ ]
     [ ] [8] [9]
     ```
   - This satisfies the condition as 7, 8, and 9 are adjacent to 6.
   - The sum of 7, 8, and 9 is 24.
