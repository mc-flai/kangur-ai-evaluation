### Reasoning:
1. The problem states that the faces of a die are labeled with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
2. It also states that faces 1 and 6 have one common edge, as do faces 1 and 5, 1 and 2, 6 and 5, 6 and 4, and 6 and 2.
3. To determine which face is opposite face 4, we need to identify the face that does not share an edge with face 4.
4. Face 4 shares an edge with faces 1, 3, and 6.
5. Therefore, the face that does not share an edge with face 4 must be the face opposite to it.
