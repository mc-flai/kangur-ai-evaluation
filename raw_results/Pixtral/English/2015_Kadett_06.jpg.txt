Reasoning:
1. The total drive from A-village to B-town via C-house takes 130 minutes.
2. The drive from A-village to C-house takes 35 minutes.
3. To find the drive time from C-house to B-town, subtract the time taken to reach C-house from the total time.

Calculation:
Total time (A-village to B-town via C-house) = 130 minutes
Time taken to reach C-house (A-village to C-house) = 35 minutes

Time from C-house to B-town = Total time - Time to reach C-house
Time from C-house to B-town = 130 minutes - 35 minutes
Time from C-house to B-town = 95 minutes

Answer: A
