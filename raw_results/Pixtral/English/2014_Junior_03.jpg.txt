### Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Pieces of Wire:**
   - Piece \( a \): This piece is the shortest among the three.
   - Piece \( b \): This piece is longer than piece \( a \) but shorter than piece \( c \).
   - Piece \( c \): This piece is the longest among the three.

2. **Compare the Lengths:**
   - Piece \( a \) is shorter than piece \( b \) (i.e., \( a < b \)).
   - Piece \( b \) is shorter than piece \( c \) (i.e., \( b < c \)).

3. **Combine the Inequalities:**
   - Since \( a < b \) and \( b < c \), it follows that \( a < b < c \).

### Answer: A)
