### Reasoning:

To determine which quadrant contains no points of the graph of the linear function \( f(x) = -3.5x + 7 \), we need to analyze the slope and the y-intercept of the function.

1. **Slope Analysis**:
   - The slope of the function \( f(x) = -3.5x + 7 \) is \(-3.5\).
   - A negative slope indicates that the line decreases as \( x \) increases and increases as \( x \) decreases.

2. **Y-Intercept**:
   - The y-intercept of the function is \( 7 \), which means the line crosses the y-axis at \( (0, 7) \).

3. **Quadrant Analysis**:
   - Since the slope is negative, the line will go from the first quadrant to the third quadrant.
   - Starting at \( (0, 7) \) in the first quadrant, as \( x \) increases, \( y \) will decrease, moving the line towards the third quadrant.
   - The line will never enter the second quadrant because the y-values will always be positive (since \( -3.5x \) is always less than \( 7 \) for positive \( x \)).
   - The line will never enter the fourth quadrant because the y-values will always be greater than zero (since \( -3.5x \) is always less than \( 7 \) for negative \( x \)).

Therefore, the line \( f(x) = -3.5x + 7 \) will only pass through the first and third quadrants, but not the second or fourth quadrants.
