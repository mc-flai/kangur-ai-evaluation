### Reasoning:
1. We are given that the sum of all the numbers on the board is 2018.
2. We are also given that the product of all the numbers on the board is 2018.
3. Since the sum and the product are both 2018, it suggests that the numbers on the board are all the same. This is because the only way for the product of several numbers to be equal to their sum is if all the numbers are identical.
4. Therefore, the number that could be on the board must be the same as the sum and the product, which is 2018.
