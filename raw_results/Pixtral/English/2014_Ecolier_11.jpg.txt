### Reasoning:
The multiplication pyramid works by multiplying the numbers that are next to each other horizontally to get the number directly above them in the middle. In the given pyramid, the numbers 2 and 2 are next to each other at the bottom. To find the number in the grey field, we need to multiply these two numbers.

Step-by-step calculation:
