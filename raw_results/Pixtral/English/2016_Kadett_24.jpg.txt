Reasoning: Let's denote the original amount of waffles as W. Each time Little Red Riding Hood reaches a grandmother's house, the wolf eats half of the remaining waffles. This means that after visiting each grandmother, the amount of waffles left is a quarter of the original amount. Since each grandmother receives the same amount of waffles, the original amount must be divisible by 3 (the number of grandmothers).

Let's denote the amount each grandmother receives as G. Therefore, we have:
W = 3G

Since the wolf eats half each time, the remaining waffles after each grandmother's house are:
- After the first grandmother: W/2
- After the second grandmother: (W/2)/2 = W/4

Since W/4 must be equal to G (the amount each grandmother gets), we have:
W/4 = G

Combining the two equations, we get:
W = 3 * (W/4)
W = 3W/4
4W = 12W
W = 12W/4
W = 3W

This implies that W must be divisible by 3. Additionally, since the wolf eats half each time, the remaining waffles must be a power of 2. The only number from the options that is a power of 2 is 4 (2^2).
