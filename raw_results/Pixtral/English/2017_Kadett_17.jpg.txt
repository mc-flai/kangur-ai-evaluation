Reasoning: Simon wants to divide the wire into 9 equal pieces, which means he will make 8 cuts. Barbara wants to divide the wire into 8 equal pieces, which means she will make 7 cuts. Carl cuts the wire at every mark made by both Simon and Barbara. Therefore, the total number of cuts Carl makes is the sum of the cuts made by Simon and Barbara.

- Barbara's cuts: 7
- Total cuts by Carl: 8 + 7 = 15
