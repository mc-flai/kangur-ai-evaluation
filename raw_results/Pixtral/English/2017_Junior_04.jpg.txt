Reasoning:
1. Maria has 24 Euros initially.
2. Each of her 3 sisters has 12 Euros.
3. The total amount of Euros that Maria and her sisters have together is calculated as follows:
   - Maria: 24 Euros
   - Each sister: 12 Euros
   - Total for 3 sisters: 12 Euros * 3 = 36 Euros
   - Combined total: 24 Euros (Maria) + 36 Euros (sisters) = 60 Euros
4. To make the amount equal for all four sisters, including Maria, the total amount should be divided by 4:
   - Total amount to be divided: 60 Euros
   - Amount each sister should have: 60 Euros / 4 = 15 Euros
5. Maria currently has 24 Euros, so she needs to give away the difference between what she has and what she should have:
   - Difference: 15 Euros - 24 Euros = -9 Euros
   - Since the difference is negative, Maria actually needs to receive 9 Euros from each sister to make the amounts equal.
6. Therefore, Maria needs to receive 9 Euros from each of her 3 sisters.
