Reasoning:
1. Buses leave the airport every 3 minutes.
2. Each bus takes 60 minutes to reach the city center.
3. A car leaves the airport at the same time as a bus but takes only 35 minutes to reach the city center.
4. The car will overtake any bus that has started before it.
5. To find out how many buses the car overtakes, we need to determine how many buses are on the road during the car's journey.

Let's calculate the time it takes for the car to reach the city center:
- The car takes 35 minutes to reach the city center.

Now, let's calculate how many buses are on the road during this time:
- Since buses leave every 3 minutes, the number of buses on the road in 35 minutes is calculated as follows:
  Number of buses = 35 minutes / 3 minutes per bus â‰ˆ 11.67 buses

Since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we consider only whole buses. Therefore, the car will overtake 11 buses.
