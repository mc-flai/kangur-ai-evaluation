**Reasoning:**
1. We have 10 balls numbered from 0 to 9.
2. Each person can take three balls and calculate the total of the numbers on the balls.
3. To maximize the difference between the totals, we need to consider the highest and lowest possible sums.

   - The highest possible sum occurs when each person takes the three balls with the highest numbers.
   - The lowest possible sum occurs when each person takes the three balls with the lowest numbers.

   Let's calculate the highest and lowest sums:

   - Highest sum: 9 + 8 + 7 = 24
   - Lowest sum: 0 + 1 + 2 = 3

   The difference between the highest and lowest sums is 24 - 3 = 21.

**Answer:** E)
