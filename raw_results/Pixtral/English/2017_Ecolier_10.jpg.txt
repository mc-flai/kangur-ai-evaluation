### Reasoning:
The problem states that four apples and one pear weigh as much as three pears. We need to determine the correct relationship between the weights of apples and pears based on this information.

Let's denote the weight of one apple as \( A \) and the weight of one pear as \( P \). According to the problem, we have the following equation:

\[ 4A + P = 3P \]

To solve for the relationship between \( A \) and \( P \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[ 4A = 3P - P \]
\[ 4A = 2P \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ 2A = P \]

This means that one pear weighs as much as two apples.

### Answer:
E) Two apples weigh as much as one pear.
