### Reasoning:
1. A 3x3x3 cube consists of 27 small cubes in total.
2. By examining the provided images, we can count the number of small cubes visible in each view.
3. From the right view, we see 4 small cubes.
4. From the top view, we see 4 small cubes.
5. From the front view, we see 4 small cubes.
6. Summing these, we have 4 (right) + 4 (top) + 4 (front) = 12 small cubes visible.
7. To find the number of small cubes removed, subtract the visible cubes from the total number of cubes in the original cube.
8. 27 (total cubes) - 12 (visible cubes) = 15 cubes removed.
9. However, the provided options do not include 15. Upon re-examining the problem, we realize that the images show a 2x2x2 cube, which consists of 8 small cubes.
10. Therefore, the correct number of small cubes removed from a 2x2x2 cube is 8 - 4 = 4.
