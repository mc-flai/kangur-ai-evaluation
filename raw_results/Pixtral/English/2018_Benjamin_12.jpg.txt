### Reasoning:
1. The problem states that four smudges hide four of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
2. The calculations along the two arrows are correct, leading to the sum of 8.
3. We need to determine which number hides behind the smudge with the star.

To find the correct number, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify the sum of the numbers hidden by the smudges.
2. Subtract the sum of the visible numbers from 8 to find the hidden number.

Let's analyze the visible calculations:
- The first arrow shows a calculation resulting in 4.
- The second arrow shows a calculation resulting in 4.

If the visible numbers are 1 and 2, the sum of the visible numbers is 1 + 2 = 3.
- The total sum of all hidden numbers is 8.
- Therefore, the sum of the hidden numbers is 8 - 3 = 5.

Since the star indicates the number we need to find, the hidden number must be 5.
