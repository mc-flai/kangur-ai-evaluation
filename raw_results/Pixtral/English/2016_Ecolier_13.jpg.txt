Reasoning: The question asks how many pictures show the triangle placed after the square. This means we need to count the number of images where the triangle is the topmost shape and the square is beneath it.

- Image (A): The triangle is on top of the square.
- Image (B): The triangle is on top of the square.
- Image (C): The triangle is on top of the square.
- Image (D): The triangle is on top of the square.
- Image (E): The triangle is not on top of the square.

Counting the images where the triangle is on top of the square, we have images (A), (B), (C), and (D).

Answer: D
