Reasoning:
1. Each carriage has at least one passenger.
2. Two passengers are considered neighboring if they are in the same carriage or in two successive carriages.
3. Each passenger has either exactly 5 or exactly 10 neighbors.

Let's analyze the given options:
- Option A (13 passengers): This is not possible because if there are 13 passengers, it is not divisible by 5 or 10, and each passenger must have exactly 5 or 10 neighbors.
- Option B (15 passengers): This is possible. If there are 15 passengers, they can be arranged such that each passenger has exactly 5 or 10 neighbors. For example, if there are 3 carriages with 5 passengers each, the arrangement can be made to satisfy the neighbor condition.
- Option C (17 passengers): This is not possible because 17 is not divisible by 5 or 10, and each passenger must have exactly 5 or 10 neighbors.
- Option D (20 passengers): This is possible. If there are 20 passengers, they can be arranged such that each passenger has exactly 5 or 10 neighbors. For example, if there are 4 carriages with 5 passengers each and one carriage with 6 passengers, the arrangement can be made to satisfy the neighbor condition.
- Option E (This situation is not possible): This is incorrect because options B and D are possible.

Answer: B) 15
