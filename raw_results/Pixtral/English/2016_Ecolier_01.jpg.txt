### Reasoning:
To determine who has the biggest total from throwing two dice, we need to add up the numbers on each pair of dice for each person and compare the totals.

- Amy's dice show 6 and 4, which adds up to 6 + 4 = 10.
- Bert's dice show 3 and 5, which adds up to 3 + 5 = 8.
- Carl's dice show 2 and 2, which adds up to 2 + 2 = 4.
- Doris's dice show 1 and 6, which adds up to 1 + 6 = 7.
- Ernst's dice show 5 and 5, which adds up to 5 + 5 = 10.

Comparing the totals:
- Amy: 10
- Bert: 8
- Carl: 4
- Doris: 7
- Ernst: 10

Both Amy and Ernst have the highest total of 10.
