To determine how many equally sized small triangles will be obtained by cutting the shape in Figure 1, we need to analyze the given figures and the problem statement.

First, observe Figure 2, which shows a single small triangle. This triangle is used as a reference for the size of the triangles we need to count in Figure 1.

Next, examine Figure 1. By visually counting the number of small triangles that can be formed, we can determine the total number.

Reasoning:
1. Identify the dimensions of the small triangle in Figure 2.
2. Count the number of such triangles that can fit within the boundaries of Figure 1.
3. Ensure that each triangle fits perfectly within the shape without overlapping or leaving gaps.

Upon careful examination, we find that the shape in Figure 1 can be divided into 16 small triangles, each identical to the one shown in Figure 2.
