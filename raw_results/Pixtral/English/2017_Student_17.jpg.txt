### Reasoning:

Julia has 1009 black discs and 1008 white discs. She wants to lay the biggest square pattern possible, starting with a black disc in the left upper corner and alternating colors in each row and column.

1. **Determine the size of the square pattern:**
   - The number of discs in each row and column of the square must be the same.
   - The total number of discs used must be a multiple of both 1009 and 1008 to ensure no discs are left over.

2. **Find the greatest common divisor (GCD):**
   - The GCD of 1009 and 1008 is the largest number of discs that can be used to form a complete square.
   - Using the Euclidean algorithm:
     - 1009 % 1008 = 11
     - 1008 % 11 = 0
   - Therefore, the GCD is 11.

3. **Calculate the number of discs used in the square:**
   - Each side of the square will have 11 discs.
   - The total number of discs used is 11 * 11 = 121.

4. **Determine the remaining discs:**
   - Total discs available: 1009 black + 1008 white = 2017
   - Discs used in the square: 121
   - Remaining discs: 2017 - 121 = 1896

5. **Check the remaining discs by color:**
   - Black discs remaining: 1009 - 121 = 888
   - White discs remaining: 1008 - 121 = 887

6. **Verify the options:**
   - Option A: none - Incorrect, as there are remaining discs.
   - Option B: 40 of each color - Incorrect, as there are 888 black and 887 white discs remaining.
   - Option C: 40 black and 41 white ones - Incorrect, as there are 888 black and 887 white discs remaining.
   - Option D: 41 of each color - Correct, as there are 888 black and 887 white discs remaining.
   - Option E: 40 white and 41 black ones - Incorrect, as there are 888 black and 887 white discs remaining.
