### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: We start with a 5x5 grid of 25 white fields.
2. **Target Pattern**: The goal is to achieve a chessboard pattern where alternating fields are black and white.
3. **Move Mechanics**: Each move changes the color of two adjacent fields (horizontally or vertically).
4. **Minimum Moves Calculation**:
   - To achieve the chessboard pattern, we need to flip the color of half of the fields (12 fields out of 25).
   - Each move flips two fields, so the minimum number of moves required is 12 / 2 = 6 moves.
   - However, this is the theoretical minimum. In practice, we need to consider the arrangement and ensure that each move effectively contributes to the pattern.
