### Reasoning:
1. The problem describes a square bit of paper being folded along dashed lines and then unfolded.
2. One corner of the resulting small square is cut off.
3. We need to determine how many holes are on the inner area of the piece of paper after unfolding.

To solve this, consider the following steps:
- When the paper is folded along the dashed lines, it creates smaller sections within the square.
- Each fold creates a new line that intersects with other lines, forming smaller squares or rectangles.
- Cutting off one corner of the resulting small square removes part of the folded sections.

From the diagram, we can see:
- The original square is divided into 16 smaller sections (4x4 grid).
- Cutting off one corner removes one of these sections, leaving 15 sections.
- Each fold creates intersections that form additional smaller sections within the grid.
- The intersections create 9 smaller sections within the grid.

Therefore, the number of holes (or intersections) on the inner area of the piece of paper is 9.
