Reasoning: The problem states that the number on each tile is equal to the sum of the numbers on the two tiles directly below it. We need to determine which number is on the tile marked with "?" by using the given numbers and the rule provided.

1. The top tile has the number 2039.
2. The two tiles directly below it are 2020 and another tile marked with "?".
3. According to the rule, the number on the tile marked with "?" should be the difference between 2039 and 2020.
4. Calculate the difference: 2039 - 2020 = 19.

Therefore, the number on the tile marked with "?" is 19.
