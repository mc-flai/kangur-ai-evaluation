Reasoning: The year 2016 has digits 2, 0, 1, and 6. The sum of these digits is 2 + 0 + 1 + 6 = 9. The question asks for the next year after 2016 where the sum of the digits is also 9. We need to find a year that has digits whose sum equals 9.

Let's check each option:

- (A) 2007: The digits are 2, 0, 0, and 7. The sum is 2 + 0 + 0 + 7 = 9.
- (B) 2025: The digits are 2, 0, 2, and 5. The sum is 2 + 0 + 2 + 5 = 9.
- (C) 2034: The digits are 2, 0, 3, and 4. The sum is 2 + 0 + 3 + 4 = 9.
- (D) 2108: The digits are 2, 1, 0, and 8. The sum is 2 + 1 + 0 + 8 = 11.
- (E) 2134: The digits are 2, 1, 3, and 4. The sum is 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 10.
