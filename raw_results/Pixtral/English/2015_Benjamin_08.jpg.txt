### Reasoning:
Peter is using a magnifying glass to look at a picture hanging on the wall. A magnifying glass enlarges the image, allowing the viewer to see details that would otherwise be difficult to discern with the naked eye. The question asks which section of the picture Peter cannot see through the magnifying glass.

When using a magnifying glass, the section of the image that is not magnified is the area outside the immediate focus of the lens. This means that the edges of the picture or any part not within the field of view of the magnifying glass will not be visible in detail.
