### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves a closed polygon whose vertices are the midpoints of the edges of a die. We need to find the sum of all interior angles of this polygon.

2. **Properties of Polygons**: The sum of the interior angles of any polygon can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of sides of the polygon.

3. **Determining the Number of Sides**: A die is a cube, and each face of the cube has 4 edges. Since the vertices of the polygon are the midpoints of the edges of the die, each face of the die contributes 4 midpoints. However, each edge of the die is shared by two faces, so we need to account for this to avoid double-counting.

4. **Counting the Sides**: Each face of the die contributes 4 midpoints, and there are 6 faces. However, each midpoint is shared by two faces, so the total number of unique midpoints (sides of the polygon) is:
   \[
   \frac{4 \times 6}{2} = 12
   \]

5. **Calculating the Sum of Interior Angles**: Using the formula for the sum of interior angles:
   \[
   \text{Sum of interior angles} = (12 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 10 \times 180^\circ = 1800^\circ
   \]
