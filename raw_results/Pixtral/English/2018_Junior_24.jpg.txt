Reasoning: To determine the largest possible value of n for concentric circles with radii 1 and 9 that form an annulus, where n circles without overlap are drawn inside the annulus and each circle touches both circles of the annulus, we need to consider the space available within the annulus. The annulus is the region between the two concentric circles. The inner circle has a radius of 1, and the outer circle has a radius of 9. The width of the annulus is 9 - 1 = 8 units. Each additional circle must fit within this width without overlapping any other circle and must touch both the inner and outer circles.

To fit a circle within the annulus, the diameter of the circle must be less than or equal to the width of the annulus. If we consider the diameter of the circles to be 2r (where r is the radius of the circles), then 2r ≤ 8. Solving for r, we get r ≤ 4. Therefore, the maximum radius of the circles that can fit within the annulus is 4. Since the circles must touch both the inner and outer circles, the radius of the circles that can fit within the annulus is 4.

The area of the annulus can be calculated as the difference between the areas of the outer and inner circles: π(9^2) - π(1^2) = 81π - π = 80π. The area of one circle with radius 4 is π(4^2) = 16π. The maximum number of such circles that can fit within the annulus without overlapping is the ratio of the area of the annulus to the area of one circle: 80π / 16π = 5.

Therefore, the largest possible value of n is 5.
