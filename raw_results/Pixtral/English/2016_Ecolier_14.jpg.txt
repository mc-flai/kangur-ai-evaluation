Reasoning: The problem states that from 4 kg of fresh mushrooms, Konrad gets 1 kg of dried mushrooms. This indicates a ratio of 4 kg of fresh mushrooms to 1 kg of dried mushrooms. To find out how many kilograms of fresh mushrooms are needed to get 4 kg of dried mushrooms, we can set up a proportion. If 1 kg of dried mushrooms comes from 4 kg of fresh mushrooms, then 4 kg of dried mushrooms will come from 4 times that amount of fresh mushrooms. Therefore, 4 kg of dried mushrooms will require 4 * 4 kg = 16 kg of fresh mushrooms.
