### Reasoning:
1. We are given that the points \( A_0, A_1, A_2, \ldots \) all lie on a straight line.
2. It is also given that \( A_0 A_1 = 1 \) and \( A_n \) is the midpoint of every line segment \( A_{n+1} A_{n+2} \) for every non-negative index \( n \).
3. To find the length of the line segment \( A_0 A_{11} \), we need to determine the pattern of the distances between consecutive points.

Let's denote the distance between \( A_0 \) and \( A_1 \) as \( d_1 \), between \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \) as \( d_2 \), and so on.

Given:
- \( A_0 A_1 = 1 \)
- \( A_n \) is the midpoint of \( A_{n+1} A_{n+2} \)

This implies:
- \( A_1 A_2 = 2 \times A_0 A_1 = 2 \times 1 = 2 \)
- \( A_2 A_3 = 2 \times A_1 A_2 = 2 \times 2 = 4 \)
- \( A_3 A_4 = 2 \times A_2 A_3 = 2 \times 4 = 8 \)
- And so on.

The distances form a geometric sequence with the first term \( a = 1 \) and common ratio \( r = 2 \).

The length of the line segment \( A_0 A_{11} \) can be found by summing the first 11 terms of this geometric sequence:
\[ A_0 A_{11} = a + ar + ar^2 + \ldots + ar^{10} \]
\[ A_0 A_{11} = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \ldots + 2^{10} \]

This is a geometric series with the sum formula:
\[ S_n = a \frac{r^{n+1} - 1}{r - 1} \]

For \( n = 11 \):
\[ S_{11} = 1 \frac{2^{11} - 1}{2 - 1} \]
\[ S_{11} = 1 \times (2048 - 1) \]
\[ S_{11} = 1 \times 2047 \]
\[ S_{11} = 2047 \]
