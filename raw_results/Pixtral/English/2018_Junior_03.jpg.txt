### Reasoning:
To determine the length of the third side of the triangle, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem. This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side, and the difference of the lengths of any two sides must be less than the length of the third side.

Given:
- One side has length 5.
- Another side has length 2.
- The length of the third side is an odd whole number.

Let's denote the length of the third side as \( x \).

According to the triangle inequality theorem:
1. \( 5 + 2 > x \) (Sum of two sides must be greater than the third side)
2. \( 5 - 2 < x \) (Difference of two sides must be less than the third side)

Simplifying these inequalities:
1. \( 7 > x \)
2. \( 3 < x \)

Combining these inequalities, we get:
\[ 3 < x < 7 \]

The odd whole numbers within this range are 3, 5, and 7.

However, we are given that the length of the third side is an odd whole number. We need to check if 3 satisfies the triangle inequality theorem:
- \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) which is equal to 3, not greater than 3. This does not satisfy the inequality.

Therefore, the correct length of the third side must be either 5 or 7.
