Reasoning:
1. The motorboat takes 4 hours to travel downstream from X to Y. This means the speed of the stream aids the boat, making the effective speed of the boat (speed in still water + speed of the stream) such that it covers the distance in 4 hours.
2. The motorboat takes 6 hours to travel upstream from Y to X. This means the speed of the stream opposes the boat, making the effective speed of the boat (speed in still water - speed of the stream) such that it covers the distance in 6 hours.
3. To find the time it takes for a tree trunk (which floats with the stream and does not have its own propulsion) to travel from X to Y, we need to consider the speed of the stream alone.
4. The time taken to travel downstream (with the stream) is 4 hours, and the time taken to travel upstream (against the stream) is 6 hours. The difference in time (6 hours - 4 hours = 2 hours) represents the time taken by the stream to move the tree trunk the same distance without any boat propulsion.
5. Therefore, the time it takes for a tree trunk to float from X to Y is 2 hours.
