Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of lines required to connect seven marked points such that each point is joined to the same number of other points. This is a classic problem of graph theory where each point represents a vertex and each line represents an edge. For each point to be joined to the same number of other points, the graph must be regular. In a regular graph, each vertex has the same degree (number of connections). The smallest degree that allows for a regular graph with seven vertices is 2, which would make it a bipartite graph. However, since we need each point to be joined to the same number of other points, we need to consider higher degrees. The smallest degree that allows for a regular graph with seven vertices is 3. This means each vertex must be connected to three other vertices. Therefore, the total number of lines required is (7 * 3) / 2, because each line connects two vertices. This simplifies to 21 / 2, which equals 10.5, but since we cannot have half a line, we round up to 11 lines.
