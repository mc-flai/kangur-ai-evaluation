Reasoning:
1. Susanne is 6 years old.
2. Lisa, Susanne's sister, is 2 years younger than Susanne. Therefore, Lisa is 6 - 2 = 4 years old.
3. Max, Susanne's brother, is 2 years older than Susanne. Therefore, Max is 6 + 2 = 8 years old.
4. To find the combined age of the three siblings, we add their ages together: 6 (Susanne) + 4 (Lisa) + 8 (Max) = 18.

Answer: D
