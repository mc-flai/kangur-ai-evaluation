### Reasoning:

To determine which function has the most intersections with the graph of \( f(x) = x \), we need to consider the nature of each function and how they behave as \( x \) changes.

1. **Function \( g_1(x) = x^2 \)**:
   - The graph of \( x^2 \) is a parabola opening upwards. It intersects the line \( y = x \) at two points: \( (0, 0) \) and \( (1, 1) \).

2. **Function \( g_2(x) = x^3 \)**:
   - The graph of \( x^3 \) is a cubic function that passes through the origin and increases more rapidly than \( x^2 \). It intersects the line \( y = x \) at three points: \( (0, 0) \), \( (1, 1) \), and \( (-1, -1) \).

3. **Function \( g_3(x) = x^4 \)**:
   - The graph of \( x^4 \) is a quartic function that passes through the origin and increases even more rapidly than \( x^3 \). It intersects the line \( y = x \) at four points: \( (0, 0) \), \( (1, 1) \), \( (-1, -1) \), and \( (2, 16/16) \).

4. **Function \( g_4(x) = -x^4 \)**:
   - The graph of \( -x^4 \) is a quartic function that passes through the origin and decreases more rapidly than \( x^3 \). It intersects the line \( y = x \) at four points: \( (0, 0) \), \( (1, 1) \), \( (-1, -1) \), and \( (-2, 16/16) \).

5. **Function \( g_5(x) = -x \)**:
   - The graph of \( -x \) is a straight line with a negative slope. It intersects the line \( y = x \) at one point: \( (0, 0) \).

### Answer:

The function with the most intersections with the graph of \( f(x) = x \) is \( g_3(x) = x^4 \).
