### Reasoning:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number that Ella must write into the circle marked with "?" in such a way that each number in the circle is equal to the sum of its two direct neighbors. This is a classic problem involving circular arrangements and can be solved using the properties of modular arithmetic.

Let's denote the numbers in the circles as follows:
- Circle 1: \( a \)
- Circle 2: \( b \)
- Circle 3: \( c \)
- Circle 4: \( d \)
- Circle 5: \( e \)

Given that each number is the sum of its two direct neighbors, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( a = b + c \)
2. \( b = c + d \)
3. \( c = d + e \)
4. \( d = e + a \)
5. \( e = a + b \)

We already know that one of the circles contains the number 3 and another contains the number 5. Let's assume Circle 1 contains 3 and Circle 2 contains 5. We can then work through the equations to find the other numbers.

Starting with Circle 1:
\[ a = 3 \]

From Circle 2:
\[ b = 5 \]

Using the first equation:
\[ a = b + c \]
\[ 3 = 5 + c \]
\[ c = 3 - 5 \]
\[ c = -2 \]

Using the second equation:
\[ b = c + d \]
\[ 5 = -2 + d \]
\[ d = 5 + 2 \]
\[ d = 7 \]

Using the third equation:
\[ c = d + e \]
\[ -2 = 7 + e \]
\[ e = -2 - 7 \]
\[ e = -9 \]

Using the fourth equation:
\[ d = e + a \]
\[ 7 = -9 + 3 \]
\[ 7 = -6 \]
This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate our assumptions.

Let's assume Circle 1 contains 5 and Circle 2 contains 3:
\[ b = 3 \]
\[ a = 5 \]

Using the first equation:
\[ a = b + c \]
\[ 5 = 3 + c \]
\[ c = 5 - 3 \]
\[ c = 2 \]

Using the second equation:
\[ b = c + d \]
\[ 3 = 2 + d \]
\[ d = 3 - 2 \]
\[ d = 1 \]

Using the third equation:
\[ c = d + e \]
\[ 2 = 1 + e \]
\[ e = 2 - 1 \]
\[ e = 1 \]

Using the fourth equation:
\[ d = e + a \]
\[ 1 = 1 + 5 \]
\[ 1 = 6 \]
This is also not possible, so we need to re-evaluate our assumptions.

Let's assume Circle 1 contains -16 and Circle 2 contains 3:
\[ b = 3 \]
\[ a = -16 \]

Using the first equation:
\[ a = b + c \]
\[ -16 = 3 + c \]
\[ c = -16 - 3 \]
\[ c = -19 \]

Using the second equation:
\[ b = c + d \]
\[ 3 = -19 + d \]
\[ d = 3 + 19 \]
\[ d = 22 \]

Using the third equation:
\[ c = d + e \]
\[ -19 = 22 + e \]
\[ e = -19 - 22 \]
\[ e = -41 \]

Using the fourth equation:
\[ d = e + a \]
\[ 22 = -41 + (-16) \]
\[ 22 = -57 \]
This is also not possible, so we need to re-evaluate our assumptions.

Let's assume Circle 1 contains -8 and Circle 2 contains 3:
\[ b = 3 \]
\[ a = -8 \]

Using the first equation:
\[ a = b + c \]
\[ -8 = 3 + c \]
\[ c = -8 - 3 \]
\[ c = -11 \]

Using the second equation:
\[ b = c + d \]
\[ 3 = -11 + d \]
\[ d = 3 + 11 \]
\[ d = 14 \]

Using the third equation:
\[ c = d + e \]
\[ -11 = 14 + e \]
\[ e = -11 - 14 \]
\[ e = -25 \]

Using the fourth equation:
\[ d = e + a \]
\[ 14 = -25 + (-8) \]
\[ 14 = -33 \]
This is also not possible, so we need to re-evaluate our assumptions.

Let's assume Circle 1 contains -3 and Circle 2 contains 3:
\[ b = 3 \]
\[ a = -3 \]

Using the first equation:
\[ a = b + c \]
\[ -3 = 3 + c \]
\[ c = -3 - 3 \]
\[ c = -6 \]

Using the second equation:
\[ b = c + d \]
\[ 3 = -6 + d \]
\[ d = 3 + 6 \]
\[ d = 9 \]

Using the third equation:
\[ c = d + e \]
\[ -6 = 9 + e \]
\[ e = -6 - 9 \]
\[ e = -15 \]

Using the fourth equation:
\[ d = e + a \]
\[ 9 = -15 + (-3) \]
\[ 9 = -18 \]
This is also not possible, so we need to re-evaluate our assumptions.
