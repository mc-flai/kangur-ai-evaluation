Reasoning: To determine which number replaces the question mark (?) in the equation \(2 \cdot 18 \cdot 14 = 6 \cdot ? \cdot 7\), we need to simplify the equation and find the missing factor. First, calculate the left-hand side of the equation:

\[ 2 \cdot 18 \cdot 14 \]

\[ 2 \cdot 18 = 36 \]

\[ 36 \cdot 14 = 504 \]

Now, we have:

\[ 504 = 6 \cdot ? \cdot 7 \]

Next, calculate the right-hand side of the equation:

\[ 6 \cdot 7 = 42 \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ 504 = 42 \cdot ? \]

To find the missing factor, divide 504 by 42:

\[ \frac{504}{42} = 12 \]

Therefore, the number that replaces the question mark is 12.
