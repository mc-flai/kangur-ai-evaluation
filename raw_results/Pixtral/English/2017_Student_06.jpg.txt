### Reasoning:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The diagram shows a circle with center \(O\) and diameters \(AB\) and \(CX\).
   - It is given that \(OB = BC\), which means \(OB = BC = \frac{1}{2}AB\).

2. **Determine the area of the shaded region:**
   - The shaded region is a sector of the circle.
   - The central angle of the sector is \(60^\circ\) because \(OB = BC\) divides the circle into two equal parts.

3. **Calculate the area of the sector:**
   - The total area of the circle is \(A = \pi r^2\).
   - The area of a sector with a central angle \(\theta\) is given by \(\frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2\).
   - For a \(60^\circ\) sector, the area is \(\frac{60}{360} \times \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{6} \pi r^2\).

4. **Determine the fraction of the circle area that is shaded:**
   - The shaded area is \(\frac{1}{6} \pi r^2\).
   - The total area of the circle is \(\pi r^2\).
   - Therefore, the fraction of the circle area that is shaded is \(\frac{\frac{1}{6} \pi r^2}{\pi r^2} = \frac{1}{6}\).
