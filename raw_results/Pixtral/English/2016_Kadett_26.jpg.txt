### Reasoning:
1. We are given that the product of the two smallest numbers is 16. The pairs of numbers that multiply to 16 are (1, 16) and (2, 8).
2. We are also given that the product of the two biggest numbers is 225. The pairs of numbers that multiply to 225 are (1, 225), (3, 75), (5, 45), and (9, 25).
3. Since no two numbers are the same, we can eliminate the pair (1, 16) because it would imply that 16 is repeated.
4. The smallest pair that fits the criteria is (2, 8), and the largest pair that fits the criteria is (9, 25).
5. The remaining numbers must be such that their product is not given and they are distinct.
6. We need to find the sum of all these numbers: 2, 8, 9, and 25.

Sum = 2 + 8 + 9 + 25 = 44
