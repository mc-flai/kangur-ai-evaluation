### Reasoning:
The question asks which of the given pictures does not show ladybird Sophie. According to the description, Sophie turns, which implies that the correct picture should show Sophie in a turning position. We need to identify which picture does not match this description.

- (A) shows a ladybird facing left.
- (B) shows a ladybird facing right.
- (C) shows a ladybird facing left.
- (D) shows a ladybird facing right.
- (E) shows a ladybird facing right.

Since Sophie turns, the pictures that show the ladybird facing the same direction (left or right) without any indication of turning might not be Sophie. The correct answer should show a ladybird in a turning position.

### Answer:
C
