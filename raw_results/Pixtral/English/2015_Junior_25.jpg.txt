### Reasoning:

In a right-angled triangle, the angle bisector of the acute angle splits the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the lengths of the other two sides. This is known as the Angle Bisector Theorem. According to this theorem, if the angle bisector splits the opposite side into segments of lengths \(a\) and \(b\), then the ratio of these segments is equal to the ratio of the other two sides of the triangle.

Let's denote the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle as \(c\) and \(d\). According to the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:

\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}
\]

Given that the angle bisector splits the opposite side into segments of length 1 and 2, we can set \(a = 1\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the length of the angle bisector can be found using the formula for the length of an angle bisector in a triangle, which is:

\[
\text{Length of angle bisector} = \sqrt{ab}
\]

Substituting \(a = 1\) and \(b = 2\) into the formula, we get:

\[
\text{Length of angle bisector} = \sqrt{1 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{2}
\]
