Reasoning:
1. We need to find numbers between 10 and 32 that contain only the digits 1, 2, or 3.
2. The numbers must be two-digit numbers since they are greater than 10.
3. We will list all possible combinations of the digits 1, 2, and 3 to form two-digit numbers.
4. The possible combinations are:
   - 11, 12, 13
   - 21, 22, 23
   - 31, 32, 33
5. Counting these combinations, we have 9 possible numbers.
