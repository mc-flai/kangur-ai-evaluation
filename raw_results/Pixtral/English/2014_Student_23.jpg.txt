Reasoning:
1. We know there are 9 kangaroos, and they are either white or black.
2. The probability that none of the three Greatkangs is white is exactly two-thirds.
3. To find out how many Greatkangs are black, we need to consider the total number of Greatkangs and the given probability.

Let's denote the number of black Greatkangs as B and the number of white Greatkangs as W. We know that B + W = 3 (since there are three Greatkangs).

The probability that none of the three Greatkangs is white is given as 2/3. This means that the probability that all three are black is 2/3.

The probability of selecting a black Greatkang from the group of 9 is the number of black Greatkangs divided by the total number of Greatkangs:
\[ \frac{B}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \]

Solving for B:
\[ B = 2 \]

Therefore, there are 2 black Greatkangs.
