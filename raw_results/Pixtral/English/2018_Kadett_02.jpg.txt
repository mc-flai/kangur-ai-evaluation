### Reasoning:
To determine which words have a vertical axis of symmetry when written underneath each other, we need to check if the top half of the word is a mirror image of the bottom half when flipped vertically. Let's examine each option:

- **A) ADAM**: When written underneath each other, it reads "MADA". This is not the same as "ADAM", so it does not have vertical axis symmetry.
- **B) BAUM**: When written underneath each other, it reads "MUAB". This is not the same as "BAUM", so it does not have vertical axis symmetry.
- **C) BOOT**: When written underneath each other, it reads "TOOB". This is not the same as "BOOT", so it does not have vertical axis symmetry.
- **D) LOGO**: When written underneath each other, it reads "OLOG". This is not the same as "LOGO", so it does not have vertical axis symmetry.
- **E) TOTO**: When written underneath each other, it reads "OTOT". This is the same as "TOTO", so it has vertical axis symmetry.

### Answer: E)
