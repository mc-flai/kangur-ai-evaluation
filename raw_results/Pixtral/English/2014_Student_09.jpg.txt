### Reasoning:
1. When two identical cylinders are cut open and then stuck together along their vertical dotted lines, the resulting shape is essentially one long cylinder.
2. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.
3. If two identical cylinders are combined, their combined height will be the sum of their individual heights, while the radius remains the same.
4. Therefore, the volume of the resulting cylinder will be twice the volume of one of the smaller cylinders because the height is doubled while the radius remains unchanged.

### Answer: A) It is 2-times as big.
