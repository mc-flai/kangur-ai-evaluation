### Reasoning:
1. Today, the sum of Carmen, Gerda, and Sabine's ages is 44.
2. We need to find the next time their combined ages form a two-digit number with two equal digits.
3. The possible two-digit numbers with two equal digits are: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99.
4. Since their current sum is 44, the next possible sum that fits the criteria is 55 (the smallest two-digit number with two equal digits greater than 44).

### Answer: A)
