Reasoning:
1. We know that 45 teachers at Anna's school come to school by bike, which represents 60% of all teachers.
2. To find the total number of teachers, we can set up the equation 60% of total teachers = 45 teachers.
3. Solving for the total number of teachers, we get:
   0.60 * total teachers = 45
   total teachers = 45 / 0.60
   total teachers = 75
4. Now, we know there are 75 teachers in total.
5. We are told that 12% of the teachers come to school by car.
6. To find the number of teachers who come by car, we calculate:
   0.12 * 75 = 9
