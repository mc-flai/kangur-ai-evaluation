### Reasoning:

1. **Identify the Signs of Individual Terms:**
   - \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are different real numbers not equal to zero.
   - \(n\) is a positive whole number.

2. **Analyze the Given Expressions:**
   - The expressions given are \((-2)^{2n+3} \times a^{2n+2} \times b^{2n-1} \times c^{3n+2}\) and \((-3)^{2n+2} \times a^{4n+1} \times b^{4n+5} \times c^{3n-4}\).

3. **Determine the Sign of Each Term:**
   - \((-2)^{2n+3}\): Since \(2n+3\) is an odd number and the base is negative, this term is negative.
   - \(a^{2n+2}\): Since \(a\) is not zero and \(2n+2\) is even, the sign depends on whether \(a\) is positive or negative.
   - \(b^{2n-1}\): Since \(2n-1\) is odd, the sign depends on whether \(b\) is positive or negative.
   - \(c^{3n+2}\): Since \(3n+2\) is even, the sign depends on whether \(c\) is positive or negative.
   - \((-3)^{2n+2}\): Since \(2n+2\) is even and the base is negative, this term is positive.
   - \(a^{4n+1}\): Since \(4n+1\) is odd, the sign depends on whether \(a\) is positive or negative.
   - \(b^{4n+5}\): Since \(4n+5\) is odd, the sign depends on whether \(b\) is positive or negative.
   - \(c^{3n-4}\): Since \(3n-4\) is even, the sign depends on whether \(c\) is positive or negative.

4. **Determine the Overall Sign:**
   - The overall sign of the first expression is determined by \((-2)^{2n+3} \times a^{2n+2} \times b^{2n-1} \times c^{3n+2}\).
   - The overall sign of the second expression is determined by \((-3)^{2n+2} \times a^{4n+1} \times b^{4n+5} \times c^{3n-4}\).
   - For both expressions to have the same sign, the signs of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) must be consistent in both expressions.

5. **Consistency Check:**
   - If \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are all positive, both expressions will be positive.
   - If \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are all negative, both expressions will be negative.
   - If any of \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) is positive and the others are negative, the signs will not match.

### Answer:

Given that the expressions have the same sign, \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) must all be of the same sign (either all positive or all negative).

- If \(a > 0\), \(b > 0\), and \(c > 0\), both expressions will be positive.
- If \(a < 0\), \(b < 0\), and \(c < 0\), both expressions will be negative.

Therefore, the correct statement is:

Answer: A) \(a > 0\)
