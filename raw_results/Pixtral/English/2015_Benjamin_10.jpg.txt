### Reasoning:
Andrea has 4 equally long strips of paper, each of unknown length. When she glues two strips together with an overlap of 10 cm, she gets a strip 50 cm long. This means the length of each strip before overlap is calculated as follows:

Let the length of each strip be \( L \).

When two strips are glued together with a 10 cm overlap, the combined length is:
\[ L + L - 10 \text{ cm} = 50 \text{ cm} \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ 2L - 10 = 50 \]
\[ 2L = 60 \]
\[ L = 30 \text{ cm} \]

So, each strip is 30 cm long.

For the second glue, she wants to make a 56 cm long strip using the remaining two strips. Let the overlap for this glue be \( x \) cm.

The combined length of the two strips with overlap \( x \) cm is:
\[ 30 \text{ cm} + 30 \text{ cm} - x = 56 \text{ cm} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 - x = 56 \]
\[ x = 4 \text{ cm} \]
