### Reasoning:

1. We are given the sequence \( x_n \) with the initial condition \( x_1 = 2 \) and the recurrence relation \( x_{n+1} = x_n x_n \) for \( n \geq 1 \).

2. Let's compute the first few terms of the sequence to identify a pattern:
   - \( x_1 = 2 \)
   - \( x_2 = x_1 \cdot x_1 = 2 \cdot 2 = 4 \)
   - \( x_3 = x_2 \cdot x_2 = 4 \cdot 4 = 16 \)
   - \( x_4 = x_3 \cdot x_3 = 16 \cdot 16 = 256 \)

3. Observing the pattern, we see that each term is the square of the previous term:
   - \( x_2 = 2^2 \)
   - \( x_3 = 2^4 \)
   - \( x_4 = 2^8 \)

4. Therefore, the general form of \( x_n \) can be expressed as \( x_n = 2^{2^n} \).

### Answer:

E) \( 2^{2^{16}} \)
