### Reasoning:
1. The problem states that the net is folded along the dotted lines to form an open box.
2. The open box is placed on the table with the opening on the top.
3. To determine which side is facing the table, we need to visualize the folding process.
4. By examining the net, we can see that folding along the dotted lines will bring certain sides together.
5. The side labeled "A" is on the top left corner of the net.
6. When folded, side "A" will be on the top of the box, facing upwards.
7. Therefore, the side facing the table will be the side opposite to "A," which is "E."

### Answer: E
