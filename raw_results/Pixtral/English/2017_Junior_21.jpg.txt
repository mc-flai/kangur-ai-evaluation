To determine the sum of the ages of the four gorillas, we need to factorize 882 into four whole numbers that are all less than 18.

First, let's factorize 882:

882 ÷ 2 = 441
441 ÷ 3 = 147
147 ÷ 3 = 49

So, 882 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 49.

Now, we need to find four whole numbers that are less than 18 and multiply to 882. We can start by breaking down 49:

49 = 7 × 7

Now, we have the factors 2, 3, 3, 7, and 7. We need to arrange these factors into four numbers that are less than 18. Let's consider the combinations:

1. 2 × 3 = 6
2. 3 × 7 = 21 (too large)
3. 3 × 7 = 21 (too large)
4. 7 × 7 = 49 (too large)

We need to adjust the factors to ensure all numbers are less than 18. We can use 2, 3, 3, and 7, and one of the 7s can be broken down further:

7 = 7

So, we have:

1. 2 × 3 = 6
2. 3 × 3 = 9
3. 7 = 7
4. 1 × 1 = 1

Summing these ages: 6 + 9 + 7 + 1 = 23

Reasoning: We factorized 882 and found the factors 2, 3, 3, 7, and 7. We then arranged these factors into four numbers less than 18, ensuring their product is 882.
