### Reasoning:
1. Start with the given time: 17:00 (5:00 PM).
2. Add 17 hours to 17:00.
3. Calculate the new hour: 17 + 17 = 34 hours.
4. Since the clock resets every 12 hours, we need to find the equivalent time within a 24-hour period.
5. Divide 34 by 12 to find the remainder: 34 รท 12 = 2 remainder 10.
6. The remainder 10 hours corresponds to 10:00.
