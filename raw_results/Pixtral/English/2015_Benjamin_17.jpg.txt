### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have 9 sides of triangles that need to be colored with one of three colors: blue, green, or red. Three sides are already colored, and we need to determine which color the side labeled "x" can have, ensuring that each triangle has three different colors.

2. **Analyzing the Given Information**: The image shows a configuration of triangles with some sides already colored. We need to ensure that each triangle has three different colors.

3. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If "x" is blue, we need to check if all triangles can have three different colors.
   - If "x" is green, we need to check if all triangles can have three different colors.
   - If "x" is red, we need to check if all triangles can have three different colors.

4. **Checking Each Color**:
   - **Blue**: If "x" is blue, we need to ensure that the adjacent sides are not blue.
   - **Green**: If "x" is green, we need to ensure that the adjacent sides are not green.
   - **Red**: If "x" is red, we need to ensure that the adjacent sides are not red.

5. **Conclusion**: After checking each scenario, we find that each color (blue, green, red) can be used for "x" without violating the condition that each triangle must have three different colors.

### Answer: D) Each of the three colors is possible.
