### Reasoning:
To determine the largest number that can be made by placing the digits 2, 3, 4, and 5 in squares and then adding two numbers together, we need to consider the possible combinations of these digits.

1. **Identify the largest possible two-digit number:**
   - The largest digit is 5, so it should be in the tens place.
   - The next largest digit is 4, so it should be in the ones place.
   - This gives us the number 54.

2. **Identify the largest possible three-digit number:**
   - The largest digit is 5, so it should be in the hundreds place.
   - The next largest digit is 4, so it should be in the tens place.
   - The next largest digit is 3, so it should be in the ones place.
   - This gives us the number 543.

3. **Add the two largest numbers identified:**
   - 54 (two-digit number)
   - 543 (three-digit number)
   - Adding these together: 54 + 543 = 597
