### Reasoning:
1. We know that each square borders 4 triangles.
2. Each triangle borders 3 squares.
3. The polyhedron has 6 squares.

Let's denote the number of triangles as T and the number of squares as S. We are given that S = 6.

From the problem, each square borders 4 triangles, so the total number of triangle borders around squares is 4S. Since each triangle also borders 3 squares, the total number of square borders around triangles is 3T.

Since each border is shared between two polygons, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 4S = 3T \]

Substituting the given value of S (6 squares):
\[ 4 \times 6 = 3T \]
\[ 24 = 3T \]
\[ T = \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ T = 8 \]
