### Reasoning:

1. Let's denote the number of wins by \( W \), the number of draws by \( D \), and the number of losses by \( L \).
2. We know that the total number of matches is 40:
   \[
   W + D + L = 40
   \]
3. The points system is as follows:
   - Win: 1 point
   - Draw: \( \frac{1}{2} \) point
   - Loss: 0 points
4. The total points gained are 25:
   \[
   W + \frac{D}{2} = 25
   \]
5. We need to find how many more matches the player wins than he loses, which is \( W - L \).

Let's solve the equations step by step:

1. From the points equation:
   \[
   W + \frac{D}{2} = 25
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   2W + D = 50
   \]

2. Substitute \( D \) from the total matches equation:
   \[
   D = 40 - W - L
   \]
   Substitute \( D \) in the points equation:
   \[
   2W + (40 - W - L) = 50
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   W + 40 - L = 50
   \]
   \[
   W - L = 10
   \]

Therefore, the player wins 10 more matches than he loses.
