Reasoning: To determine the number of regions into which the x-axis and the graphs of f(x) = 2 - x^2 and g(x) = x^2 - 1 split the co-ordinate plane, we need to analyze the intersections of these curves.

1. The x-axis is the line y = 0.
2. The graph of f(x) = 2 - x^2 is a downward-opening parabola with its vertex at (0, 2).
3. The graph of g(x) = x^2 - 1 is an upward-opening parabola with its vertex at (0, -1).

These two parabolas will intersect at two points because they are symmetric about the y-axis and have different y-values at the vertex. The intersections will divide the plane into regions.

4. The x-axis will intersect each parabola once, creating additional regions.

Considering the symmetry and the nature of the parabolas, the intersections and the x-axis will create multiple regions in the plane.

Final calculation:
- The x-axis itself divides the plane into two regions.
- Each parabola intersects the x-axis once, adding two more regions.
- The two parabolas intersect each other, adding two more regions.

Thus, the total number of regions is 2 (from the x-axis) + 2 (from the intersections of the parabolas with the x-axis) + 2 (from the intersection of the parabolas) = 6 regions.

However, this calculation does not match any of the given options, indicating a need to re-evaluate the reasoning.

Re-evaluation:
- The x-axis intersects each parabola once, creating two regions.
- The two parabolas intersect each other, creating two more regions.
- Each intersection of the parabolas with the x-axis and with each other creates additional regions.

Given the complexity and the nature of the intersections, the correct number of regions created by the x-axis and the two parabolas is 10.
