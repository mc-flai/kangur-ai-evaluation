### Reasoning:

1. We are given the following relationships between the numbers \(a, b, c, d, e\):
   - \(b = c \cdot e\)
   - \(d = a + b\)
   - \(a = e - d\)

2. To find the largest number, we need to analyze these relationships step by step.

3. Start by expressing \(d\) in terms of \(a\) and \(e\):
   - From \(a = e - d\), we get \(d = e - a\).

4. Substitute \(d = e - a\) into the equation \(d = a + b\):
   - \(e - a = a + b\)
   - \(b = e - 2a\)

5. Substitute \(b = c \cdot e\) into the equation \(b = e - 2a\):
   - \(c \cdot e = e - 2a\)
   - \(c = \frac{e - 2a}{e}\)

6. Since \(c\) must be a positive whole number, \(\frac{e - 2a}{e}\) must also be a positive whole number. This implies that \(e - 2a\) must be a multiple of \(e\).

7. Given that \(e\) is a positive whole number, the largest value among \(a, b, c, d, e\) will be \(e\) because \(e\) is not reduced by any operation involving subtraction or addition with other positive whole numbers.
