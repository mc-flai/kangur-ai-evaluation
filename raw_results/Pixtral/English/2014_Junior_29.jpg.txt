### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to consider all 7-digit numbers formed using the digits 1 to 7.
   - These numbers are written in increasing order of size.
   - The list is split exactly in the middle, creating two lists of equal size.
   - We need to find the last number of the first list.

2. **Counting the Total Number of 7-Digit Numbers**:
   - The total number of 7-digit numbers using the digits 1 to 7 is \(7!\) (7 factorial).
   - \(7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040\).

3. **Determining the Size of Each List**:
   - Since the list is split exactly in the middle, each list will contain \( \frac{5040}{2} = 2520 \) numbers.

4. **Finding the Last Number of the First List**:
   - The last number of the first list will be the 2520th number in the sorted list of all 7-digit numbers.

5. **Identifying the Correct Number**:
   - We need to determine which of the given options is the 2520th number in the sequence.
   - By examining the options, we can see that the correct number must be the largest among them.

6. **Comparing the Options**:
   - The options are:
     - (A) 1234567
     - (B) 3765421
     - (C) 4123567
     - (D) 4352617
     - (E) 4376521
   - Among these, 4376521 is the largest number.

### Answer:
E) 4376521
