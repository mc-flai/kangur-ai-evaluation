Reasoning: The belt has 5 holes, and the distance between each hole is 2 cm. If the belt is closed in all 5 holes, the total length of the belt is the sum of the distances between the holes. Since there are 4 gaps between the 5 holes, and each gap is 2 cm, the total additional length when using all holes is 4 gaps * 2 cm/gap = 8 cm.

If the belt is closed in only the first hole, it effectively bypasses the additional length contributed by the other 4 gaps. Therefore, the length of the belt when closed in the first hole is the original length minus the additional 8 cm.

Answer: B
