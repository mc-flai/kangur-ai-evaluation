1. A cube has six faces, and each angle in the diagram represents a corner of the cube.
2. The sum of the angles around a point in a plane is 360 degrees.
3. Since there are four marked angles, they must be part of the angles around a point on the cube.
4. The sum of the angles around a point on a cube is 360 degrees.
