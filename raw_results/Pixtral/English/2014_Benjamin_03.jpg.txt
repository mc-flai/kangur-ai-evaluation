### Reasoning:
When two rings, one white and one grey, are interlinked and viewed from the front, the overlapping sections create a specific visual pattern. This pattern changes when viewed from the back. To determine what Paul sees from the back, we need to consider how the rings are interlinked and how this affects the visible sections from different perspectives.

From the front view, the rings appear as shown in the diagram. When viewed from the back, the overlapping sections will appear differently due to the change in perspective. Specifically, the grey ring will appear to be in front of the white ring in some sections, and the white ring will appear in front of the grey ring in other sections.

By analyzing the options provided, we can identify which diagram correctly represents the rings from the back. The correct diagram will show the rings with the grey ring appearing in front of the white ring in the overlapping sections, which is different from the front view.
