Reasoning:
1. The king travels at a speed of 5 km/h from his castle to his summer residence.
2. Each hour, a messenger is sent back to the castle at a speed of 10 km/h.
3. We need to determine the time difference between two consecutive messengers arriving at the castle.

Let's denote the time it takes for the king to reach the summer residence as T_king and the time it takes for a messenger to return to the castle as T_messenger.

First, we calculate T_king:
T_king = Distance / Speed_king
T_king = D / 5 km/h

Next, we calculate T_messenger:
T_messenger = Distance / Speed_messenger
T_messenger = D / 10 km/h

Since the messengers are sent back every hour, the time difference between two consecutive messengers is simply 1 hour.

Answer: E)
