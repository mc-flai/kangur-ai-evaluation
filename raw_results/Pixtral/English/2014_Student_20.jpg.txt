### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a rectangle \(PQRS\) with \(T\) as the midpoint of \(RS\).
   - \(QT\) is normal (perpendicular) to the diagonal \(PR\).

2. **Properties of a Rectangle and Diagonals**:
   - In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other.
   - Since \(T\) is the midpoint of \(RS\), \(RT = TS\).

3. **Perpendicularity and Midpoint**:
   - \(QT\) being normal to \(PR\) implies that \(QT\) is perpendicular to \(PR\).
   - This means \(QT\) is an altitude of the triangle \(PQR\).

4. **Using the Properties of the Rectangle**:
   - Since \(T\) is the midpoint of \(RS\), \(RT = TS\).
   - The altitude \(QT\) from \(Q\) to \(PR\) will also bisect \(PR\) because \(QT\) is perpendicular to \(PR\).

5. **Calculating the Ratio**:
   - Since \(QT\) bisects \(PR\), \(PQ = QR\).
   - Therefore, the ratio of the lengths \(PQ : QR\) is \(1 : 1\).
