To determine how many numbers were chosen by both Monika and Daniel, we need to identify the sets of three different numbers from the list {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} that sum to 8 and 7 respectively.

First, let's find the combinations that sum to 8:
- 1 + 2 + 5 = 8
- 1 + 3 + 4 = 8
- 1 + 6 + 1 = 8 (not possible since 1 is used twice)
- 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 (not possible since 3 is used twice)
- 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 (not possible since 2 is used twice)
- 3 + 4 + 1 = 8 (not possible since 1 is used twice)
- 3 + 5 + 0 = 8 (not possible since 0 is not in the list)

Next, let's find the combinations that sum to 7:
- 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
- 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 (not possible since 3 is used twice)
- 1 + 4 + 2 = 7
- 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 (not possible since 2 is used twice)
- 2 + 3 + 2 = 7 (not possible since 2 is used twice)
- 3 + 3 + 1 = 7 (not possible since 3 is used twice)
- 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

Now, let's compare the valid combinations:
- For sum 8: {1, 2, 5}, {1, 3, 4}
- For sum 7: {1, 2, 4}, {1, 4, 2}, {4, 2, 1}

Comparing these sets, we find that the set {1, 2, 4} is common to both sums.

Reasoning: By identifying the valid combinations for sums 8 and 7 and comparing them, we find that the set {1, 2, 4} is common to both.

Answer: B
