### Reasoning:
1. The garden is split into equally sized square-shaped lots.
2. There are two snail crawls: one slow and one fast, moving in different directions along the outside edge of the garden.
3. The slow snail crawls 1 meter in one hour, and the fast snail crawls 2 meters in one hour.
4. Both snails start at the corner labeled S.
5. We need to determine where the two snails will meet for the first time.

To solve this, we need to calculate the time it takes for the snails to meet and the position they will be in at that time.

- The slow snail covers 1 meter per hour.
- The fast snail covers 2 meters per hour.
- Together, they cover 3 meters per hour (since 1 + 2 = 3).

Let's denote the total distance covered by both snails until they meet as \( D \).

Since they meet at the same point, the time \( t \) it takes for them to meet can be calculated by the formula:
\[ D = 3t \]

We need to find the position where they meet. The options given are A, B, C, D, and E. We need to determine which of these positions corresponds to the distance \( D \).

- A: 1 meter
- B: 2 meters
- C: 3 meters
- D: 4 meters
- E: 5 meters

Given that the snails together cover 3 meters per hour, they will meet after covering 3 meters.

### Answer: C
