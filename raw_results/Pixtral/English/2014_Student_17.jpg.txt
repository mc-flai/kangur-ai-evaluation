### Reasoning:
1. Let's denote the total weight of the soft cheese as \( W \).
2. The total amount of fat in the cheese is given as 24% of \( W \), so the weight of the fat is \( 0.24W \).
3. The fat in the dry substance is 64%, which means that in the dry substance, 64% is fat.
4. Let's denote the weight of the dry substance as \( D \). Therefore, the fat in the dry substance is \( 0.64D \).
5. Since the fat in the dry substance is 64%, the dry substance is 100% - 64% = 36% of the total weight of the cheese.
6. Thus, \( D = 0.36W \).
7. The fat in the dry substance can also be expressed as \( 0.24W \) since it is the same amount of fat.
8. Therefore, \( 0.24W = 0.64D \).
9. Substituting \( D = 0.36W \) into the equation, we get \( 0.24W = 0.64 \times 0.36W \).
10. Simplifying, \( 0.24W = 0.2304W \).
11. The weight of the water in the cheese is \( W - D \).
12. The percentage of water in the cheese is \( \frac{W - D}{W} \times 100 \).
13. Substituting \( D = 0.36W \) into the equation, we get \( \frac{W - 0.36W}{W} \times 100 = \frac{0.64W}{W} \times 100 = 64\% \).
14. Therefore, the percentage of water in the cheese is \( 100\% - 64\% = 36\% \).
