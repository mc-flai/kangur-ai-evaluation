Reasoning: To solve this problem, we need to identify the numbers on opposite faces of the cube and add them together. The cube has six faces, and opposite faces will always sum to the same total. By examining the given numbers on the faces, we can determine the sums of the opposite faces.

1. Face 1 is opposite to face 6.
2. Face 2 is opposite to face 5.
3. Face 3 is opposite to face 4.

Now, let's calculate the sums of the opposite faces:
- Face 1 and Face 6: 1 + 6 = 7
- Face 2 and Face 5: 2 + 5 = 7
- Face 3 and Face 4: 3 + 4 = 7

Each pair of opposite faces sums to 7. Therefore, the three results Sascha gets are all 7.

Answer: D
