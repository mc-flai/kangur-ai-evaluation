### Reasoning:

1. We need to find the number of ways to choose three different digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(ab < bc < ca\).
2. Let's start by considering the possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Since they are digits, they can range from 1 to 9.
3. For \(ab < bc < ca\) to hold, \(a\) must be the smallest digit, \(b\) must be the middle digit, and \(c\) must be the largest digit.
4. We need to count the number of ways to choose \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a < b < c\).
5. The number of ways to choose 3 different digits out of 9 is given by the combination formula \(C(9, 3)\).
6. Calculate \(C(9, 3)\):
   \[
   C(9, 3) = \frac{9!}{3!(9-3)!} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84
   \]
