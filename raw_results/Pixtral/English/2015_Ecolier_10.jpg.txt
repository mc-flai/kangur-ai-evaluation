### Reasoning:
1. When folding a net of a cube, each face connects to four adjacent faces.
2. The number 3 is on one of the faces of the cube.
3. To find the face opposite to the face with the number 3, we need to identify which face is directly across from it in the net.
4. By examining the net, we can see that the face with the number 3 is adjacent to the faces with the numbers 2, 4, 5, and 6.
5. The face that is directly opposite to the face with the number 3 is the one that does not share an edge with it.
6. From the net, the face with the number 1 does not share an edge with the face with the number 3.
