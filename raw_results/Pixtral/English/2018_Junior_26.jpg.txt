### Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: Diana draws a rectangle made up of 2018 squares. She colors some squares black and writes the number of adjacent black squares in every white square.
2. **Analyzing the Example**: The example given shows a smaller rectangle with 12 squares. Each white square has a number representing the count of adjacent black squares.
3. **Calculating the Sum for the Example**: For the example rectangle, the numbers in the white squares are: 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1. The sum of these numbers is 1 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9.
4. **Extending to 2018 Squares**: To find the sum for a rectangle of 2018 squares, we need to consider the pattern and the distribution of black and white squares.
5. **Summing Up**: The sum of the numbers in the white squares for a larger rectangle will depend on the number of black squares and their adjacency. Given the options, we need to find the highest possible sum.
