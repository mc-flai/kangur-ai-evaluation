### Reasoning:

Given the equation \( a + 2 = b - 2 = c \times 2 = d + 2 \), we need to determine which of the four numbers \( a, b, c, \) or \( d \) is the biggest.

1. **Understanding the Equation:**
   - The equation \( a + 2 = b - 2 \) implies that \( b = a + 4 \).
   - The equation \( b - 2 = c \times 2 \) implies that \( c = \frac{b - 2}{2} = \frac{a + 4 - 2}{2} = \frac{a + 2}{2} \).
   - The equation \( c \times 2 = d + 2 \) implies that \( d = 2c - 2 = 2 \left( \frac{a + 2}{2} \right) - 2 = a \).

2. **Simplifying the Relationships:**
   - From \( b = a + 4 \), we see that \( b \) is 4 more than \( a \).
   - From \( c = \frac{a + 2}{2} \), we see that \( c \) is half of \( a + 2 \).
   - From \( d = a \), we see that \( d \) is equal to \( a \).

3. **Comparing the Values:**
   - Since \( b = a + 4 \), \( b \) is greater than \( a \).
   - Since \( c = \frac{a + 2}{2} \), \( c \) is less than \( a \) because \( \frac{a + 2}{2} \) is less than \( a \) for positive \( a \).
   - Since \( d = a \), \( d \) is equal to \( a \).

Therefore, \( b \) is the largest number among \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \).
