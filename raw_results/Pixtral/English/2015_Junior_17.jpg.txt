### Reasoning:
1. Initially, the objects \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) are placed on a double balance as shown.
2. When two objects are exchanged, the positions of the balance change.
3. By comparing the initial and final positions of the balance, we can determine which two objects were exchanged.

### Initial Balance:
- Left side: \(a\)
- Right side: \(b\), \(c\), \(d\)

### Final Balance:
- Left side: \(a\), \(d\)
- Right side: \(b\), \(c\)

### Analysis:
- The object \(a\) remains on the left side.
- The object \(d\) is moved from the right side to the left side.
- The objects \(b\) and \(c\) remain on the right side.

### Conclusion:
- The objects exchanged are \(d\) and \(a\).

### Answer: D
