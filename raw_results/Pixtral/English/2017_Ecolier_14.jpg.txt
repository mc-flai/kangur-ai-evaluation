### Reasoning:
Ben wants to cut out two identical pieces from a 4 x 3 grid. To determine which shapes cannot be achieved, we need to analyze each option and see if it's possible to cut out two identical pieces from the grid.

- **Option (A):** This shape can be achieved by cutting two L-shaped pieces from the grid.
- **Option (B):** This shape can be achieved by cutting two identical T-shaped pieces from the grid.
- **Option (C):** This shape can be achieved by cutting two identical rectangular pieces from the grid.
- **Option (D):** This shape can be achieved by cutting two identical rectangular pieces from the grid.
- **Option (E):** This shape cannot be achieved because it requires cutting two identical pieces that are not possible within the constraints of the 4 x 3 grid.

### Answer: E
