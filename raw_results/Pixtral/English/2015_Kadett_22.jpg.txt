### Reasoning:

1. **Identify the possible pairs of sums:**
   - We know the sums of three pairs of cards are 57, 70, and 83.

2. **Determine the total sum of all five cards:**
   - The sum of the pairs is \(57 + 70 + 83 = 210\).
   - Since each card is counted twice in this sum, the total sum of all five cards is \(210 / 2 = 105\).

3. **Find the fifth card:**
   - Let the five cards be \(a, b, c, d, e\).
   - We know \(a + b = 57\), \(c + d = 70\), and \(e + f = 83\).
   - The total sum of all cards is \(a + b + c + d + e = 105\).
   - To find the fifth card, we need to solve for \(e\):
     \[
     e = 105 - (a + b + c + d)
     \]
   - We can express \(a + b + c + d\) as the sum of the other three pairs:
     \[
     a + b + c + d = 57 + 70 + 83 - e
     \]
   - Substituting back, we get:
     \[
     e = 105 - (57 + 70 + 83 - e)
     \]
   - Simplifying, we find:
     \[
     e = 105 - 210 + e
     \]
   - Solving for \(e\), we get:
     \[
     2e = 105 \implies e = 52.5
     \]
   - This is not possible since \(e\) must be a whole number. We need to re-evaluate our approach.

4. **Re-evaluate the approach:**
   - We need to find the correct pairs that sum to 105.
   - Let's assume the pairs are \((a, b), (c, d), (e, f)\).
   - We know:
     \[
     a + b = 57
     \]
     \[
     c + d = 70
     \]
     \[
     e + f = 83
     \]
   - The total sum of all cards is:
     \[
     a + b + c + d + e + f = 105
     \]
   - We need to find the correct pairs that sum to 105.

5. **Check the possible combinations:**
   - If we assume \(a + b = 57\), \(c + d = 70\), and \(e + f = 83\), then:
     \[
     a + b + c + d + e + f = 57 + 70 + 83 = 210
     \]
   - This is incorrect since the total should be 105.
   - We need to find the correct pairs that sum to 105.

6. **Correct pairs:**
   - Let's assume \(a + b = 57\), \(c + d = 70\), and \(e + f = 38\) (since \(105 - 57 - 70 = 38\)).
   - Then:
     \[
     a + b + c + d + e + f = 57 + 70 + 38 = 105
     \]
   - This is correct.

7. **Find the largest number:**
   - The largest number among \(a, b, c, d, e, f\) is the largest sum in the pairs.
   - The largest sum is 83.

### Answer: E) 82
