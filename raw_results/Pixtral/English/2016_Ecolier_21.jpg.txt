### Reasoning:
1. We know that the bowls are ordered by weight, with Q being the lightest and T being the heaviest.
2. The current order of the bowls is Q, R, S, and T, with Q being the lightest and T being the heaviest.
3. Bowl Z needs to be placed in the correct position to maintain the order of weights.

Given the options:
- A) to the left of bowl Q
- B) between bowls Q and R
- C) between bowls R and S
- D) between bowls S and T
- E) to the right of bowl T

We need to determine where Z fits in the sequence:
- If Z is lighter than Q, it should be placed to the left of Q.
- If Z is heavier than Q but lighter than R, it should be placed between Q and R.
- If Z is heavier than R but lighter than S, it should be placed between R and S.
- If Z is heavier than S but lighter than T, it should be placed between S and T.
- If Z is heavier than T, it should be placed to the right of T.
