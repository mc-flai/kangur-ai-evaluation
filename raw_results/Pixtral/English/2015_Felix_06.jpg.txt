Reasoning: To determine which kangaroo card can be turned around to look the same as the card shown on the right, we need to compare the orientation and positioning of the kangaroo on each card with the kangaroo on the reference card. The reference card shows a kangaroo facing to the right. We need to find a card where the kangaroo is in the same position and orientation when rotated.

- (A) The kangaroo is facing left.
- (B) The kangaroo is facing left.
- (C) The kangaroo is facing left.
- (D) The kangaroo is facing left.
- (E) The kangaroo is facing right, similar to the reference card.

Upon comparison, card (E) has the kangaroo facing right, which matches the orientation of the reference card.
