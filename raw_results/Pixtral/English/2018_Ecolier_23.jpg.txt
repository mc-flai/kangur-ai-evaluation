### Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to fill the fields with numbers 1 to 7 such that no two consecutive numbers are in adjacent fields.
2. **Field Configuration**: We need to consider the adjacency rules. Fields are adjacent if they share an edge or a corner.
3. **Consecutive Numbers**: Consecutive numbers (e.g., 1 and 2, 2 and 3, etc.) cannot be placed in adjacent fields.
4. **Question Mark Field**: We need to determine which numbers can be placed in the field with the question mark.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A) all 7 numbers**: This is not possible because consecutive numbers cannot be placed in adjacent fields.
- **Option B) only odd numbers**: This is not possible because it would require placing consecutive odd numbers in adjacent fields.
- **Option C) only even numbers**: This is not possible for the same reason as option B.
- **Option D) the number 4**: Placing the number 4 alone does not use all the fields and does not consider the adjacency rule.
- **Option E) the numbers 1 or 7**: These are the only numbers that are not consecutive to each other, so they can be placed in adjacent fields without violating the rule.

### Answer:
E) the numbers 1 or 7
