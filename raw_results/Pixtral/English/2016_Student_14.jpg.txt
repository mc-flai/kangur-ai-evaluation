### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a rectangle \(ABCD\) where the side \(BC\) is exactly half as long as the diagonal \(\overline{AC}\).
   - We need to find the point \(X\) on \(\overline{CD}\) such that \(|\overline{AX}| = |\overline{XC}|\) and determine the angle \(\angle CAX\).

2. **Properties of Rectangle and Diagonal**:
   - In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other.
   - Since \(BC\) is half the length of \(\overline{AC}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) is a diagonal, \(BC\) must be perpendicular to \(AD\) and \(BC = \frac{1}{2} \times AC\).

3. **Finding Point \(X\)**:
   - Point \(X\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{CD}\) because \(|\overline{AX}| = |\overline{XC}|\) implies that \(X\) is equidistant from \(A\) and \(C\).
   - Since \(X\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AX}\) and \(\overline{XC}\) are both half the length of \(\overline{AC}\).

4. **Calculating the Angle \(\angle CAX\)**:
   - In a rectangle, the diagonal forms a right angle with the sides.
   - Since \(X\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{CD}\), \(\angle CAX\) is half of the right angle (90 degrees).
   - Therefore, \(\angle CAX = \frac{90^\circ}{2} = 45^\circ\).
