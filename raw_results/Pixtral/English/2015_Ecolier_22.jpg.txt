### Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have a square with 9 dots, and the distance between any two adjacent dots is the same.
2. **Identifying Possible Square Sizes**: To form a square by joining 4 points, we need to consider the possible side lengths of the square.
3. **Smallest Square**: The smallest square that can be formed will have a side length of 1 (using adjacent dots).
4. **Larger Squares**: We can form larger squares by skipping dots. For example, a square with a side length of 2 can be formed by skipping one dot between each pair of adjacent dots.
5. **Counting Different Sizes**: We can form squares of side lengths 1, 2, and 3 by skipping dots appropriately.
