Reasoning: Hannes is placing one coin on each of eight spaces that lie next to each other on a game board with 11 spaces. The key is to understand how the placement of the coins affects the filling of spaces. If Hannes starts placing coins from one end, the coins will occupy consecutive spaces. However, the placement of the first coin can affect the number of spaces that will definitely be filled.

- If Hannes starts at the first space, the coins will occupy spaces 1 through 8.
- If Hannes starts at the second space, the coins will occupy spaces 2 through 9.
- If Hannes starts at the third space, the coins will occupy spaces 3 through 10.
- If Hannes starts at the fourth space, the coins will occupy spaces 4 through 11.

In each of these scenarios, the last coin placed will be at the end of the sequence, and no additional spaces will be filled beyond the last coin's position. Therefore, no matter where Hannes starts, the last space will definitely be filled.
