To determine the smallest number of stars that can be replaced by "+" to make the equation correct, we need to analyze the given equation:

\[ 2 * 0 * 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 * 1 * 5 * 2 * 0 * 1 * 5 = 0 \]

First, let's simplify the equation by performing the multiplications step-by-step:

1. \( 2 * 0 = 0 \)
2. \( 0 * 1 = 0 \)
3. \( 0 * 5 = 0 \)
4. \( 0 * 2 = 0 \)
5. \( 0 * 0 = 0 \)
6. \( 0 * 1 = 0 \)
7. \( 0 * 5 = 0 \)
8. \( 0 * 2 = 0 \)
9. \( 0 * 0 = 0 \)
10. \( 0 * 1 = 0 \)
11. \( 0 * 5 = 0 \)

Now, substituting these results back into the equation, we get:

\[ 0 * 0 * 0 * 0 * 0 * 0 * 0 * 0 * 0 * 0 * 0 * 0 = 0 \]

Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, the equation holds true regardless of the order of the multiplications. Therefore, the equation is already correct as it stands.

However, if we need to replace stars with "+" to make the equation correct, we need to consider that replacing a star with "+" does not change the outcome of the equation because the result of any multiplication involving zero remains zero.

Thus, the smallest number of stars that can be replaced by "+" to ensure the equation remains correct is zero.

Reasoning: The equation is already correct as it stands, and replacing stars with "+" does not affect the outcome.
