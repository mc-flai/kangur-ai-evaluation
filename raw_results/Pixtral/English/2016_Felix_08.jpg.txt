Reasoning: The problem states that Grandma is calling her cat and all her chickens. It also mentions that after a little while, 20 legs are running towards her. Chickens have 2 legs each, and the cat also has 2 legs. To find the number of chickens, we need to subtract the 4 legs (2 for the cat) from the total 20 legs.

Total legs = 20
Legs for the cat = 2
Remaining legs for chickens = 20 - 2 = 18

Since each chicken has 2 legs, the number of chickens is:
Number of chickens = 18 / 2 = 9

Answer: B)
