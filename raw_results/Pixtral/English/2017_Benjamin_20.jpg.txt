### Reasoning:
1. We know that Michael scored the fewest number of goals.
2. The total number of goals scored by the other players is 20.
3. To find the maximum number of goals Michael could have scored, we need to consider the minimum possible goals scored by the other players.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by the other players as \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \), where \( x_i \) represents the goals scored by the \( i \)-th player. Since Michael scored the fewest goals, let's denote his goals as \( x \).

Given that the total number of goals scored by the other players is 20, we have:
\[ x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n = 20 \]

Since Michael scored the fewest goals, let's assume the other players scored \( x, x+1, x+2, \ldots \). To maximize Michael's goals, we need to minimize the goals scored by the other players.

If we assume the other players scored 1, 2, 3, and 4 goals respectively, the sum would be:
\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 \]

This leaves 10 goals for Michael. However, we need to ensure the total is 20. If we assume the other players scored 4, 5, 6, and 7 goals respectively, the sum would be:
\[ 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22 \]

This exceeds the total of 20 goals. Therefore, we need to adjust the numbers to ensure the total is 20. The correct distribution would be:
\[ 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 20 \]

This means the other players scored 4, 5, 6, and 5 goals respectively, leaving 10 goals for Michael.
