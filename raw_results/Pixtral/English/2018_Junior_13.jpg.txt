Reasoning: To determine the area of the white part, we need to calculate the area of the square and subtract the area of the eight congruent semi-circles.

1. The area of the square is given by the formula \( \text{side length}^2 \). Since the side length of the square is 4, the area of the square is \( 4^2 = 16 \).

2. Each semi-circle has a radius of \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \). The area of one semi-circle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (2)^2 = 2\pi \).

3. Since there are eight semi-circles, the total area of the semi-circles is \( 8 \times 2\pi = 16\pi \).

4. The area of the white part is the area of the square minus the total area of the semi-circles, which is \( 16 - 16\pi \).

5. The given options are \( 2\pi \), \( 8 \), \( 6 + \pi \), \( 3\pi - 2 \), and \( 3\pi \). We need to find which of these matches \( 16 - 16\pi \).

6. Simplifying \( 16 - 16\pi \) does not directly match any of the given options, but we can look for an approximation or a related expression. The closest option that involves \( \pi \) and a constant is \( 3\pi \).
