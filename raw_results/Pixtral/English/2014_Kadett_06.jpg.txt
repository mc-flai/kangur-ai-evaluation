**Reasoning**:
1. Each page of square paper has an area of 4 square units.
2. Wanda cuts each page into right-angled triangles and squares.
3. The shape in the right-hand diagram is formed using some of these pieces.
4. To find the total area of the shape, we need to count the number of pieces used and multiply by the area of each piece.
5. From the right-hand diagram, it appears that the shape is composed of 6 pieces of square paper.

Calculation:
- Area of one piece of square paper = 4 square units
- Number of pieces used = 6
- Total area = 6 pieces * 4 square units/piece = 24 square units

**Answer**: E
