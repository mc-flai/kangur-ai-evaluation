To ensure Sebastian has at least one apple and one pear of the same color, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where he picks fruits of different colors until he is forced to pick the same color.

1. Sebastian starts by picking one green apple (1 piece).
2. He then picks one yellow apple (2 pieces).
3. Next, he picks one green pear (3 pieces).
4. He picks one yellow pear (4 pieces).
5. Now, he picks another green apple (5 pieces).
6. He picks another yellow pear (6 pieces).
7. He picks another green pear (7 pieces).
8. He picks another yellow pear (8 pieces).
9. He picks another green apple (9 pieces).

At this point, Sebastian has picked 9 pieces of fruit, and all of them are of different colors. The next piece he picks must be either a green apple or a green pear, ensuring he has at least one apple and one pear of the same color.

Reasoning: By picking 9 pieces of fruit, Sebastian ensures that the 10th piece will be either an apple or a pear of the same color as one of the previous pieces he has picked.
