### Reasoning:
1. Initially, each sparrow whistles as many times as the number of sparrows it can see in front of it.
2. Azra whistles four times, indicating that he can see four sparrows in front of him.
3. When one sparrow turns around, the number of sparrows each can see changes.
4. The second time, the sparrows whistle more often in total than the first time, which means the configuration has changed.
5. If Azra had turned around, the sparrows behind him would now be in front of him, and vice versa.
6. This change would result in a different number of sparrows each can see in front of them, leading to a different total number of whistles.
7. Since the total number of whistles increased, it suggests that the sparrow turning around is not Azra but someone else.
8. Considering the positions and the change in the number of whistles, the sparrow that turned around must be the one that was initially in the middle or at the end of the line, affecting the most sparrows' view.
