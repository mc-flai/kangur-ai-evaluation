Reasoning: Jim subtracted 26 from a certain number and obtained -14. To find the number he started with, we need to reverse the operation. If subtracting 26 gave -14, then adding 26 to -14 will give us the original number.

Let's denote the original number as x. According to the problem, subtracting 26 from x gives -14:
\[ x - 26 = -14 \]

To find x, we add 26 to both sides of the equation:
\[ x - 26 + 26 = -14 + 26 \]
\[ x = 12 \]

Now, to find the result Jim would have obtained if he had added 26 instead of subtracting it, we add 26 to the original number x:
\[ x + 26 = 12 + 26 \]
\[ x + 26 = 38 \]
