Reasoning:
1. According to the problem, each kangaroo-year consists of 20 kangaroo-months.
2. Each kangaroo-month is composed of 6 kangaroo-weeks.
3. To find the number of kangaroo-weeks in a quarter of a kangaroo-year, we first determine the number of kangaroo-weeks in a full kangaroo-year.
4. The number of kangaroo-weeks in a full kangaroo-year is calculated as:
   \[
   20 \text{ kangaroo-months/year} \times 6 \text{ kangaroo-weeks/month} = 120 \text{ kangaroo-weeks/year}
   \]
5. Since we need the number of kangaroo-weeks in a quarter of a kangaroo-year, we divide the total number of kangaroo-weeks in a year by 4:
   \[
   \frac{120 \text{ kangaroo-weeks/year}}{4} = 30 \text{ kangaroo-weeks/quarter}
   \]

Answer: B)
