### Reasoning:
1. The problem states that the diameters of three semi-circles form the sides of a right-angled triangle.
2. The areas of the semi-circles are given as \(X \text{ cm}^2\), \(Y \text{ cm}^2\), and \(Z \text{ cm}^2\).
3. The area of a semi-circle is half the area of a full circle, so the area of a semi-circle with diameter \(d\) is \(\frac{\pi d^2}{8}\).
4. Therefore, the areas \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) can be expressed in terms of their diameters \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) as follows:
   \[
   X = \frac{\pi x^2}{8}, \quad Y = \frac{\pi y^2}{8}, \quad Z = \frac{\pi z^2}{8}
   \]
5. We need to determine which of the given expressions is correct in the context of the Pythagorean theorem for the right-angled triangle formed by the diameters.

### Answer:
- Option (A) \(X + Y < Z\): This does not directly relate to the Pythagorean theorem.
- Option (B) \(\sqrt{X} + \sqrt{Y} = \sqrt{Z}\): This is incorrect because the sum of the lengths of the diameters does not equal the length of the hypotenuse.
- Option (C) \(X + Y = Z\): This is incorrect because the sum of the areas of the semi-circles does not equal the area of the largest semi-circle.
- Option (D) \(X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2\): This is the Pythagorean theorem applied to the diameters of the semi-circles.
- Option (E) \(X^2 + Y^2 = Z\): This is incorrect because it does not relate to the Pythagorean theorem.

### Final Answer:
D
