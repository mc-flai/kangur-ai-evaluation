### Reasoning:

1. **Song A**: Lasts 3 minutes.
2. **Song B**: Lasts 2 minutes and 30 seconds.
3. **Song C**: Lasts 2 minutes.
4. **Song D**: Lasts 1 minute and 30 seconds.
5. **Song E**: Lasts 4 minutes.

Andy left the house when Song C was playing. We need to calculate how much time has passed and which song is playing when Andy returns exactly one hour later.

First, convert the total time Andy is away into minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes.

Now, calculate the time taken for each song to play:
- Song C: 2 minutes.
- Remaining time after Song C: 60 - 2 = 58 minutes.

Next, determine the sequence of songs played after Song C:
- Song D: 1 minute and 30 seconds = 90 seconds = 1.5 minutes.
- Remaining time after Song D: 58 - 1.5 = 56.5 minutes.

- Song E: 4 minutes.
- Remaining time after Song E: 56.5 - 4 = 52.5 minutes.

- Song B: 2 minutes and 30 seconds = 150 seconds = 2.5 minutes.
- Remaining time after Song B: 52.5 - 2.5 = 50 minutes.

- Song A: 3 minutes.
- Remaining time after Song A: 50 - 3 = 47 minutes.

Since the remaining time (47 minutes) is more than the duration of any single song, Song A will be playing when Andy returns.
