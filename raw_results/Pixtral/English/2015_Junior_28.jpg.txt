Reasoning:
1. The ant starts at a vertex of a cube with side length 1.
2. To walk along each edge of the cube at least once and return to the starting point, the ant must traverse a path that covers all 12 edges of the cube.
3. The shortest path that covers all edges and returns to the starting point involves walking along three edges to form a closed loop.
4. Each edge has a length of 1 unit. Therefore, the minimum length of the walk is the sum of the lengths of the three edges.

Calculation:
- Length of one edge = 1 unit
- Total number of edges to cover = 12
- Minimum number of edges to form a closed loop = 3

Minimum possible length of her walk = 3 * 1 unit = 3 units

Answer: A) 12
