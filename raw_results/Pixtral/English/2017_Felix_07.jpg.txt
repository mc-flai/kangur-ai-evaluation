Reasoning: The problem involves understanding the effect of 10 rotations on a building block. The first three rotations are shown in the image, and we need to determine the final position after 10 rotations. Each rotation changes the orientation of the block. By following the sequence of rotations, we can deduce the final position.

1. The first rotation (1) changes the block to the second position.
2. The second rotation (2) changes the block to the third position.
3. The third rotation (3) brings the block back to the first position.

Since the block returns to its original position after three rotations, we can determine the final position after 10 rotations by finding the remainder when 10 is divided by 3.

10 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 3 with a remainder of 1. This means that after 10 rotations, the block will be in the same position as after one rotation.

By examining the first rotation (1), we see that the block moves to the second position shown in the image.

Answer: B
