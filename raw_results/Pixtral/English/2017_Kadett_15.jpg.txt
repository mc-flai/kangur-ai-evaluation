Reasoning:
1. We know that 35% of the participants are female.
2. This means that 65% of the participants are male.
3. The problem states there are 252 more male participants than female participants.
4. Let's denote the number of female participants as F. Therefore, the number of male participants is F + 252.
5. According to the percentages, the relationship between male and female participants is 65:35.
6. We can set up the equation: 0.65(F + 252) = 0.35F.
7. Solving for F:
   0.65F + 164.2 = 0.35F
   0.65F - 0.35F = -164.2
   0.30F = -164.2
   F = -164.2 / 0.30
   F = -547.33 (This doesn't make sense, so we need to recheck our steps)
8. Let's recheck the setup: 0.65(F + 252) = 0.35F
   0.65F + 164.2 = 0.35F
   0.65F - 0.35F = -164.2
   0.30F = 164.2
   F = 164.2 / 0.30
   F = 547.33
9. So, the number of female participants is approximately 547.
10. The number of male participants is 547 + 252 = 799.
11. The total number of participants is 547 (female) + 799 (male) = 1346.
