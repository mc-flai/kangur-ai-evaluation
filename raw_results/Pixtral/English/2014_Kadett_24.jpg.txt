### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the scoring system**:
   - For each correctly solved question, the first person to solve it gets 4 points.
   - The slower person gets 1 point for each question solved.

2. **Calculating points for Jan and Eva**:
   - Jan solved 60 questions.
   - Eva solved 60 questions.
   - Total points from the first to solve: \(60 \times 4 = 240\) points.
   - Total points from the slower person: \(60 \times 1 = 60\) points.
   - Combined points: \(240 + 60 = 300\) points.

3. **Adjusting for the given total points**:
   - The problem states that together they scored 312 points.
   - The difference between the calculated points (300) and the given points (312) is 12 points.
   - These 12 points must come from questions where both Jan and Eva solved the question simultaneously.

4. **Calculating the number of questions solved by both**:
   - Each question solved by both gives 5 points (4 points to the first and 1 point to the slower).
   - Number of such questions: \( \frac{12}{5} = 2.4 \).
   - Since the number of questions must be a whole number, we need to recheck the calculations.

5. **Re-evaluating the points**:
   - If both solved 1 question, they would get 5 points.
   - If both solved 2 questions, they would get 10 points.
   - If both solved 3 questions, they would get 15 points.
   - If both solved 4 questions, they would get 20 points.
   - If both solved 5 questions, they would get 25 points.
   - If both solved 6 questions, they would get 30 points.
   - If both solved 7 questions, they would get 35 points.
   - If both solved 8 questions, they would get 40 points.
   - If both solved 9 questions, they would get 45 points.
   - If both solved 10 questions, they would get 50 points.
   - If both solved 11 questions, they would get 55 points.
   - If both solved 12 questions, they would get 60 points.

   The closest number of questions that would give a total of 12 points is 11 questions, which gives 55 points.

6. **Final calculation**:
   - Total points from first to solve: \(240\).
   - Points from slower person: \(60\).
   - Points from both solving simultaneously: \(55\).
   - Combined points: \(240 + 60 + 55 = 355\).

   There seems to be a discrepancy in the problem statement. Let's recheck the problem statement and calculations.

### Answer: (C) 55
