Reasoning:
1. Let's denote the number of balls in the smallest basket as S, in the middle basket as M, and in the biggest basket as B.
2. According to the problem, the smallest and the biggest baskets together hold twice as many balls as the middle one. This can be written as:
   S + B = 2M
3. The smallest basket holds half as many balls as the middle one. This can be written as:
   S = M/2
4. Substituting S = M/2 into the first equation, we get:
   M/2 + B = 2M
5. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:
   M + 2B = 4M
6. Rearranging the equation to solve for B, we get:
   2B = 4M - M
   2B = 3M
7. Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
   B = 3M/2
8. We know the total number of balls is 48, so:
   S + M + B = 48
9. Substituting S = M/2 and B = 3M/2 into the total equation, we get:
   M/2 + M + 3M/2 = 48
10. Combining like terms, we get:
    2M = 48
11. Solving for M, we get:
    M = 24
12. Substituting M = 24 into B = 3M/2, we get:
    B = 3 * 24 / 2
    B = 36 / 2
    B = 18

Answer: D
