Reasoning:
1. Let's denote the amount of money Peter's father gives him as F.
2. Let's denote the total amount of money the two brothers give him jointly as B.
3. According to the problem, Peter's father gives him half as much money as his brothers give him jointly. Therefore, F = 0.5 * B.
4. The older brother gives him a third of the sum that the two others give him. Therefore, the older brother gives him (1/3) * (F + B).
5. The youngest brother gives him 10 €.

We need to set up the equation based on the total amount of money Peter receives:
F + (1/3) * (F + B) + 10 € = Total cost of the book.

Substitute F = 0.5 * B into the equation:
0.5 * B + (1/3) * (0.5 * B + B) + 10 € = Total cost of the book.

Simplify the equation:
0.5 * B + (1/3) * (0.5 * B + B) + 10 € = Total cost of the book.
0.5 * B + (1/3) * (0.5 * B + 1 * B) + 10 € = Total cost of the book.
0.5 * B + (1/3) * (1.5 * B) + 10 € = Total cost of the book.
0.5 * B + 0.5 * B + 10 € = Total cost of the book.
1 * B + 10 € = Total cost of the book.

Therefore, the total cost of the book is B + 10 €.

Given that the youngest brother gives 10 €, we need to find the value of B:
B + 10 € = Total cost of the book.

Since the youngest brother gives 10 €, we can deduce that B = 20 €.

Thus, the total cost of the book is:
20 € + 10 € = 30 €.
