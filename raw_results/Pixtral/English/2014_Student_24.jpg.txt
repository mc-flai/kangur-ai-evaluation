### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Diagram**: The diagram shows two circles of radius 1 that are touching each other. The straight line is their common tangent, and a square is formed with one edge on this tangent and the other vertices on the circles.

2. **Distance Between Centers of Circles**: Since the circles are touching, the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii, which is 2.

3. **Position of the Square**: The square is positioned such that one of its edges lies on the common tangent, and the other three vertices touch the circles.

4. **Side Length of the Square**: The side length of the square can be determined by considering the geometry of the situation. The height of the square from the tangent to the top vertex (which touches one of the circles) is equal to the radius of the circle, which is 1.

5. **Using Pythagoras' Theorem**: The distance from the center of the circle to the top vertex of the square is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with one leg being the radius (1) and the other leg being the side length of the square (let's call it \( s \)). Using Pythagoras' theorem:
   \[
   s^2 + 1^2 = (1 + s)^2
   \]
   Simplifying this equation:
   \[
   s^2 + 1 = 1 + 2s + s^2
   \]
   \[
   1 = 2s
   \]
   \[
   s = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
