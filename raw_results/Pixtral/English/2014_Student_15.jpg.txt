Reasoning: The problem states that six weeks are represented by the expression n! (n factorial), which is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n, multiplied by 2^1 seconds. We need to determine the value of n.

First, let's understand the factorial notation. n! means n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1.

Next, we need to consider the time unit. Six weeks converted to seconds is a large number, so we should look for a value of n that, when factored, results in a reasonable time span.

Let's evaluate the options:

- A) 6: 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720. This is a relatively small number.
- B) 7: 7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040. This is larger but still not very large.
- C) 8: 8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40320. This is larger.
- D) 10: 10! = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 3628800. This is significantly larger.
- E) 12: 12! = 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 479001600. This is extremely large.

Given that six weeks is a reasonable time span, we should look for a value of n that results in a factorial that is not too large when multiplied by 2^1 seconds.

Answer: C)
