### Reasoning:

To maximize Anna's probability of winning, we need to consider the different distributions of black and white balls across the boxes. Beate wins if she draws a white ball, so Anna should aim to minimize the number of white balls in the box Beate chooses.

Let's analyze each option:

A) Anna puts one white and one black ball into each box.
- This means each box has one white ball. The probability that Beate draws a white ball is 1/5.

B) Anna distributes the black balls into three of the boxes and the white ones into the remaining two boxes.
- This means two boxes have one white ball each. The probability that Beate draws a white ball is 2/5.

C) Anna distributes the black balls into four of the boxes and puts all of the white ones into the remaining box.
- This means one box has all five white balls. The probability that Beate draws a white ball is 1/5.

D) Anna puts all of the white balls into one box and then puts one black ball into each box.
- This means one box has all five white balls. The probability that Beate draws a white ball is 1/5.

E) Anna puts all of the black balls into one box and then puts one white ball into each box.
- This means each box has one white ball. The probability that Beate draws a white ball is 1/5.

Comparing the probabilities, options B and D have the highest probability of Beate drawing a white ball (2/5). However, options C and D have the same probability for Anna (1/5), but option D ensures that only one box has all the white balls, making it less likely for Beate to draw a white ball.

### Answer:

D
