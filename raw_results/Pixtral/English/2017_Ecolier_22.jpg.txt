### Reasoning:
Susi wants to visit exactly two of the animals, but she does not want to start with the lion. The animals she can visit are a giraffe, an elephant, and a turtle. We need to calculate the number of different possibilities for visiting two animals one after the other, excluding the lion as the starting animal.

1. If Susi starts with the giraffe, she can then visit either the elephant or the turtle.
2. If Susi starts with the elephant, she can then visit either the giraffe or the turtle.
3. If Susi starts with the turtle, she can then visit either the giraffe or the elephant.

Let's list the possibilities:
- Giraffe → Elephant
- Giraffe → Turtle
- Elephant → Giraffe
- Elephant → Turtle
- Turtle → Giraffe
- Turtle → Elephant

Counting these, we have 6 possibilities. However, we need to consider that the order in which she visits the two animals matters (e.g., Giraffe → Elephant is different from Elephant → Giraffe).

Therefore, the total number of different possibilities is 6.

### Answer: B)
