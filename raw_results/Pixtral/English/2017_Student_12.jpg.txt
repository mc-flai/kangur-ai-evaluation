### Reasoning:
1. We are given that \( p \) is a positive number smaller than 1, and \( q \) is greater than 1.
2. We need to determine which of the following numbers is the largest: \( p \times q \), \( p + q \), \( \frac{p}{q} \), \( p \), or \( q \).

Let's analyze each option:

- **Option A: \( p \times q \)**
  Since \( p \) is less than 1 and \( q \) is greater than 1, the product \( p \times q \) will be less than \( q \) because multiplying by a number less than 1 will result in a product smaller than the larger number.

- **Option B: \( p + q \)**
  Adding a positive number less than 1 to a number greater than 1 will result in a sum that is slightly greater than the larger number but still less than \( q \).

- **Option C: \( \frac{p}{q} \)**
  Dividing a number less than 1 by a number greater than 1 will result in a fraction that is less than 1.

- **Option D: \( p \)**
  This is simply the number \( p \), which is less than 1.

- **Option E: \( q \)**
  This is the number \( q \), which is greater than 1.

### Answer:
E) \( q \)
