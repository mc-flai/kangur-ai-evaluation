Reasoning: The question describes Anna's house from the front, indicating it has three windows but no door. To determine which picture shows the house from the back, we need to identify the one with three windows and no door.

- Option A: This house has three windows and no door, matching the description.
- Option B: This house has three windows and a door, which does not match the description.
- Option C: This house has three windows and no door, matching the description.
- Option D: This house has three windows and no door, matching the description.
- Option E: This house has three windows and no door, matching the description.

Since multiple options match the description, we need to consider the front view provided. The front view has a door on the right side. Therefore, the back view should not have a door and should have three windows.

Answer: A)
