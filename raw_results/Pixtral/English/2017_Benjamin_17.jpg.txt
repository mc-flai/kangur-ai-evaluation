### Reasoning:
To determine which big cube is possible, we need to consider the arrangement of the 9 identical building blocks. Each building block has two different colors, and we need to ensure that the arrangement results in a uniform and complete cube.

1. **Option A**: Check if the arrangement of the blocks forms a complete cube with uniform coloring on each face.
2. **Option B**: Check if the arrangement of the blocks forms a complete cube with uniform coloring on each face.
3. **Option C**: Check if the arrangement of the blocks forms a complete cube with uniform coloring on each face.
4. **Option D**: Check if the arrangement of the blocks forms a complete cube with uniform coloring on each face.
5. **Option E**: Check if the arrangement of the blocks forms a complete cube with uniform coloring on each face.

Upon examining each option, we find that only one arrangement results in a complete cube with uniform coloring on each face.

### Answer:
C
