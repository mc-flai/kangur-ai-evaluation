### Reasoning:
1. Observe the triangle in the diagram. The triangle is divided into smaller sections, some of which are colored grey.
2. To determine the percentage of the area colored grey, we need to count the number of grey sections and compare it to the total number of sections in the triangle.
3. The triangle is divided into 12 smaller sections (3 rows with 4 sections each).
4. Count the number of grey sections. There are 9 grey sections.
5. Calculate the percentage of the grey area:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of grey sections}}{\text{Total number of sections}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{9}{12} \right) \times 100 = 75\%
   \]

### Answer:
E) It cannot be calculated.
