### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have a square with an area of 30 square units.
   - The square is split into two triangles by its diagonal.
   - The diagonal is divided into segments labeled a, b, c, d, and e.

2. **Determine the Length of the Diagonal**:
   - The area of the square is 30 square units, so the side length of the square is √30.
   - The diagonal of a square can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: diagonal = side * √2.
   - Therefore, the diagonal length is √30 * √2.

3. **Analyze the Segments**:
   - The segments a, b, c, d, and e are parts of the diagonal.
   - To determine which segment is the longest, we need to consider the relative lengths of these segments.

4. **Comparing the Segments**:
   - The segments are labeled in a way that suggests they are parts of the diagonal.
   - Typically, in such problems, the longest segment is the entire diagonal itself.

### Answer:
   - The longest segment of the diagonal is the entire diagonal itself, which is represented by e.

   Answer: E)
