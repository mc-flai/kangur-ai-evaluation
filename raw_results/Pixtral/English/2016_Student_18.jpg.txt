### Reasoning:
To determine which of the given numbers cannot be the sum of three three-digit numbers built using the digits 1 to 9 (each digit used exactly once), we need to consider the properties of the numbers and the digits used.

1. **Sum of Digits**: The sum of the digits from 1 to 9 is \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45\).
2. **Sum of Three Numbers**: If each of the three three-digit numbers uses each digit exactly once, the sum of these three numbers must be a multiple of 3 because the sum of the digits is 45, which is a multiple of 3.

Let's check each option:

- **A) 1500**: The sum of the digits is \(1 + 5 + 0 + 0 = 6\), which is not a multiple of 3.
- **B) 1503**: The sum of the digits is \(1 + 5 + 0 + 3 = 9\), which is a multiple of 3.
- **C) 1512**: The sum of the digits is \(1 + 5 + 1 + 2 = 9\), which is a multiple of 3.
- **D) 1521**: The sum of the digits is \(1 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 9\), which is a multiple of 3.
- **E) 1575**: The sum of the digits is \(1 + 5 + 7 + 5 = 18\), which is a multiple of 3.

### Answer:
A)
