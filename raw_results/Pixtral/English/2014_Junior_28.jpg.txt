### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - \(PT\) is the tangent to a circle \(O\).
   - \(P\) is a point on the circle.
   - \(PB\) is the angle bisector of angle \(TPA\).

2. **Properties of Tangents and Circles**:
   - A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.
   - Therefore, \(\angle PTO = 90^\circ\).

3. **Angle Bisector Theorem**:
   - The angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the other two sides.
   - However, in this case, we are interested in the angle itself, not the sides.

4. **Analyzing the Diagram**:
   - Since \(PT\) is a tangent, \(\angle PTO = 90^\circ\).
   - \(PB\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle TPA\).
   - Let \(\angle TPA = x\). Then, \(\angle TPB = \frac{x}{2}\).

5. **Calculating \(\angle TBP\)**:
   - \(\angle TBP\) is the external angle to \(\triangle TPB\).
   - The external angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent internal angles.
   - Therefore, \(\angle TBP = \angle TPB + \angle PTO\).
   - \(\angle TBP = \frac{x}{2} + 90^\circ\).

6. **Finding the Value of \(x\)**:
   - Since \(\angle TPA = x\), and \(\angle TBP = \frac{x}{2} + 90^\circ\), we need to find \(x\).
   - \(\angle TPA + \angle TBP = 180^\circ\) (straight line).
   - \(x + \left(\frac{x}{2} + 90^\circ\right) = 180^\circ\).
   - \(x + \frac{x}{2} = 90^\circ\).
   - \(\frac{3x}{2} = 90^\circ\).
   - \(x = 60^\circ\).

7. **Calculating \(\angle TBP\)**:
   - \(\angle TBP = \frac{60^\circ}{2} + 90^\circ = 30^\circ + 90^\circ = 120^\circ\).

### Answer:
E) It depends on the location of point P.
