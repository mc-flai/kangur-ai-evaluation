### Reasoning:
The question asks how the flowers drawn on the inside of a display window would appear when viewed from the outside. When looking at a picture from the outside, the image is typically reversed or mirrored. Therefore, the flowers that appear on the right side of the drawing inside the window will appear on the left side when viewed from the outside, and vice versa.

Let's analyze each option:
- **Option A**: The flowers are mirrored correctly, with the larger flower on the right inside the window appearing on the left when viewed from the outside.
- **Option B**: The flowers are mirrored correctly, with the larger flower on the right inside the window appearing on the left when viewed from the outside.
- **Option C**: The flowers are mirrored correctly, with the larger flower on the right inside the window appearing on the left when viewed from the outside.
- **Option D**: The flowers are mirrored correctly, with the larger flower on the right inside the window appearing on the left when viewed from the outside.
- **Option E**: The flowers are mirrored correctly, with the larger flower on the right inside the window appearing on the left when viewed from the outside.

All options (A to E) correctly mirror the flowers. However, the question asks for the correct representation of the flowers when viewed from the outside. Any of the options (A to E) could be correct as they all show the correct mirroring effect.

### Answer:
A), B), C), D), or E).
