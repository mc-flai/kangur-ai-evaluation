Reasoning: An equilateral triangle has all three sides of equal length. Given that triangle XYZ is equilateral and has the same perimeter as triangle ABC, we first need to calculate the perimeter of triangle ABC. The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of its sides. For triangle ABC, the sides are 6 cm, 10 cm, and 11 cm. Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ABC is 6 cm + 10 cm + 11 cm = 27 cm. Since triangle XYZ is equilateral and has the same perimeter, each side of triangle XYZ must be 27 cm divided by 3, which equals 9 cm.

Answer: B
