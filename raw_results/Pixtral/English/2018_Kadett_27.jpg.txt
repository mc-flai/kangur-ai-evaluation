### Reasoning:
1. Let's denote the amount Claudia spends as \( C \).
2. According to the problem, Bettina spends 85% less than Claudia, which means Bettina spends \( 0.15C \).
3. Anna spends 60% more than Claudia, which means Anna spends \( 1.6C \).
4. The total amount spent by all three is 55 â‚¬. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   C + 0.15C + 1.6C = 55
   \]
5. Combining like terms, we get:
   \[
   2.75C = 55
   \]
6. Solving for \( C \), we find:
   \[
   C = \frac{55}{2.75} = 20
   \]
7. Now, we calculate how much Anna spends:
   \[
   1.6C = 1.6 \times 20 = 32
   \]
