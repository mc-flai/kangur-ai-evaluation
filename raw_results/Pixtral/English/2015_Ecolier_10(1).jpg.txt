### Reasoning:
1. To determine which number is on the face opposite to the face with the number 3 on a cube, we need to understand the layout of a cube.
2. A standard cube has six faces, and each face is adjacent to every other face.
3. The number 3 is on one face of the cube. The face opposite to this face will have a number that is not adjacent to 3.
4. By examining the standard layout of a cube, we can see that the face opposite to the face with the number 3 will have the number 1.
