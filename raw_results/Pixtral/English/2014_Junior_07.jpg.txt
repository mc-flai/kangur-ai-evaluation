### Reasoning:
The statement "Everybody has solved more than 20 problems" is false. This means that not everyone has solved more than 20 problems. The correct interpretation of a universal statement being false is that there exists at least one individual who does not satisfy the condition. Therefore, the correct statement must be that there is at least one person who has solved 20 or fewer problems.

Let's analyze the options:
- (A) Nobody has solved more than 20 problems. This is incorrect because the problem specifies that "Everybody has solved more than 20 problems" is false, not that nobody has solved more than 20 problems.
- (B) Somebody has solved less than 21 problems. This is correct because it implies that there is at least one person who has solved 20 or fewer problems, which is consistent with the false statement.
- (C) Everybody has solved less than 21 problems. This is incorrect because it is a universal statement, and the problem specifies that "Everybody has solved more than 20 problems" is false, not that everyone has solved less than 21 problems.
- (D) Somebody has solved exactly 20 problems. This is incorrect because it specifies an exact number, and the problem only requires that someone has solved 20 or fewer problems.
- (E) Somebody has solved more than 20 problems. This is incorrect because it contradicts the false statement that "Everybody has solved more than 20 problems."
