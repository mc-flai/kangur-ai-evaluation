### Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Jack wants to keep six tubes of diameter 2 cm together using a rubber band. We need to compare the lengths of the rubber bands in two different configurations.

2. **Configuration Analysis**:
   - **Left Picture**: The tubes are arranged in two rows of three.
   - **Right Picture**: The tubes are arranged in a triangular formation.

3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - **Left Picture**: The rubber band forms a rectangle around the tubes. The perimeter of this rectangle can be calculated by considering the dimensions of the rectangle formed by the arrangement of tubes.
     - The length of the rectangle is the distance across three tube diameters (3 * 2 cm = 6 cm).
     - The width of the rectangle is the distance across two tube diameters (2 * 2 cm = 4 cm).
     - The perimeter of the rectangle is 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (6 cm + 4 cm) = 2 * 10 cm = 20 cm.

   - **Right Picture**: The rubber band forms a shape around the tubes in a triangular formation. The perimeter of this shape can be calculated by considering the dimensions of the triangle formed by the arrangement of tubes.
     - The base of the triangle is the distance across three tube diameters (3 * 2 cm = 6 cm).
     - The height of the triangle is the distance across two tube diameters (2 * 2 cm = 4 cm).
     - The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides. Since the tubes are arranged in a triangular formation, the rubber band will follow the perimeter of this triangle, which is approximately the sum of the base and the two sides forming the height.
     - The perimeter of the triangle is approximately 6 cm + 4 cm + 4 cm = 14 cm.

4. **Comparison**:
   - The perimeter of the rectangle in the left picture is 20 cm.
   - The perimeter of the triangle in the right picture is approximately 14 cm.
   - The difference in the lengths of the rubber bands is 20 cm - 14 cm = 6 cm.
