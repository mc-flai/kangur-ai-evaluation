### Reasoning:
To solve this problem, we need to determine which square(s) can be removed from the net so that the remaining 6 squares can still form a cube. A cube has 6 faces, and each face must be connected to at least one other face. By examining the net, we can identify which squares are connected to multiple other squares and which ones are not.

1. **Square 1**: Connected to squares 2 and 3.
2. **Square 2**: Connected to squares 1, 3, and 5.
3. **Square 3**: Connected to squares 1, 2, and 6.
4. **Square 4**: Connected to squares 5 and 7.
5. **Square 5**: Connected to squares 2, 4, and 6.
6. **Square 6**: Connected to squares 3 and 5.
7. **Square 7**: Connected to squares 4 and 6.

To ensure that the remaining squares can form a cube, we need to remove squares that do not disrupt the connectivity of the remaining squares. Removing square 4 will disconnect squares 5 and 7 from the rest of the net. Removing square 7 will disconnect square 4 from the rest of the net. Removing square 3 will disconnect square 6 from the rest of the net. Removing square 6 will disconnect square 5 from the rest of the net. Removing square 1 or 2 will still leave the remaining squares connected.

Therefore, the squares that can be removed without disrupting the connectivity of the remaining squares are 3, 4, or 7.
