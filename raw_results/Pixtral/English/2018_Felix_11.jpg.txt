Reasoning: The problem states that the number of spots on the fly agaric (toadstools) indicates how many dwarfs can fit under it. Each side of the fungi has the same number of spots. When it rains, 36 dwarfs are trying to hide under the fungi. Since each side of the fungi can accommodate the same number of dwarfs, we need to determine how many dwarfs get wet.

Given that there are 36 dwarfs and both sides of the fungi have the same number of spots, we can divide the total number of dwarfs by 2 to find out how many get wet.

36 dwarfs รท 2 sides = 18 dwarfs per side.

Therefore, the number of dwarfs that get wet is 18.

Answer: (E)
