Reasoning: The figure is composed of three squares arranged such that each square is placed on top of the other. The side length of the smallest square is given as 6 cm. To find the side length of the largest square, we need to consider that each subsequent square adds to the previous one. Since the squares are arranged in a vertical stack, the side length of the largest square will be the sum of the side lengths of all three squares.

- The side length of the smallest square is 6 cm.
- The side length of the second square will be 6 cm + 6 cm = 12 cm.
- The side length of the largest square will be 6 cm + 12 cm + 6 cm = 24 cm.

Therefore, the side length of the largest square is 24 cm.
