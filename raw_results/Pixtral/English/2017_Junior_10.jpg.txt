To determine the minimum number of students who must take a button so that at least three of the buttons picked have the same color, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where students pick as many different colors as possible initially.

1. **Initial Distribution**:
   - There are 203 red, 117 white, and 28 blue buttons.
   - The total number of buttons is 203 + 117 + 28 = 348.

2. **Worst-Case Scenario**:
   - To avoid picking three buttons of the same color, students could pick one button of each color (red, white, and blue) in each round.
   - This means each student could pick one red, one white, and one blue button.

3. **Calculating Minimum Students**:
   - If each student picks one red, one white, and one blue button, the maximum number of different buttons picked without having three of the same color is two of one color and one of another.
   - To ensure at least three buttons of the same color are picked, we need to consider the distribution of the buttons.
   - The smallest number of students that guarantees at least three buttons of the same color can be calculated by considering the distribution of the buttons.

4. **Distribution Analysis**:
   - If each student picks one button, the first 28 students could pick one blue button each.
   - The next 117 students could pick one white button each.
   - The remaining students would then be forced to pick red buttons, ensuring that at least three red buttons are picked.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure that at least three buttons picked have the same color, the minimum number of students required is 28.

Reasoning: By analyzing the worst-case scenario where students pick as many different colors as possible, we determine that the minimum number of students required to ensure at least three buttons of the same color are picked is 28.
