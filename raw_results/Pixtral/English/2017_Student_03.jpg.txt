Reasoning: To determine the minimum number of bridges that need to be closed off to ensure there is no connection from island A to island B, we need to consider the structure of the graph. In graph theory, removing edges (bridges in this context) is equivalent to disconnecting nodes (islands). The goal is to find the minimum cut that separates the two nodes (A and B). According to the properties of trees (which this graph resembles), the minimum cut will involve removing the fewest number of edges that disconnect the graph. Since the graph has 10 islands and 15 bridges, we can use the formula for the minimum cut in a tree, which is the number of nodes minus one. Therefore, we need to remove 10 - 1 = 9 bridges to ensure complete disconnection. However, since we are looking for the minimum number of bridges to disconnect A from B specifically, we need to consider the paths directly connecting A and B. By examining the diagram, we can identify the critical paths and determine that removing 4 bridges will disconnect A from B.
