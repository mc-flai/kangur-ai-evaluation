### Reasoning:
1. Each building block consists of 5 little cubes.
2. There are 6 building blocks in total.
3. The little cubes are either white or grey and cubes of equal color don’t touch each other.

To determine the number of white cubes:
- Each block must have at least one white cube and one grey cube.
- Since cubes of equal color don’t touch each other, each block must have the white and grey cubes arranged in such a way that they are alternated.

Possible arrangements for each block:
- White, White, Grey, Grey, Grey
- White, Grey, White, Grey, Grey
- White, Grey, Grey, White, Grey
- White, Grey, Grey, Grey, White

Each block has exactly 2 white cubes and 3 grey cubes.

Total number of white cubes:
- 6 blocks * 2 white cubes per block = 12 white cubes
