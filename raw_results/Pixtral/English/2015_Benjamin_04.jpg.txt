Reasoning:
1. We have 10 ducks in total.
2. 5 of these ducks lay an egg every day.
3. The other 5 ducks lay an egg every second day.
4. To find out how many eggs are laid in total over 10 days, we need to calculate the contributions from both groups of ducks.

For the 5 ducks that lay an egg every day:
- Each duck lays 1 egg per day.
- Over 10 days, each duck lays 10 eggs.
- Total eggs from these 5 ducks = 5 ducks * 10 eggs/duck = 50 eggs.

For the 5 ducks that lay an egg every second day:
- Each duck lays 1 egg every 2 days.
- Over 10 days, each duck lays 5 eggs (since 10 days / 2 days per egg = 5 eggs).
- Total eggs from these 5 ducks = 5 ducks * 5 eggs/duck = 25 eggs.

Adding the eggs from both groups:
- Total eggs = 50 eggs + 25 eggs = 75 eggs.

Answer: A)
