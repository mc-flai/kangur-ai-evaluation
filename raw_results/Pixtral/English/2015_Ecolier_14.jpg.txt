### Reasoning:
Peter starts at point S and follows the direction of the arrows, turning right at the first crossing, then left at the next, and so on. Let's follow his path step-by-step:

1. Start at S.
2. Move to the first crossing and turn right.
3. Move to the next crossing and turn left.
4. Move to the next crossing and turn right.
5. Move to the next crossing and turn left.

Following this pattern, we can map out Peter's path:

- Start at S.
- Move right to the first crossing.
- Move left to the second crossing.
- Move right to the third crossing.
- Move left to the fourth crossing.

By following this pattern, we can see that Peter does not reach crossing A.
