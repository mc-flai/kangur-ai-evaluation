Reasoning: To determine the minimum number of children in the family, we need to consider the condition that every child has at least two brothers and at least one sister. This implies that there must be at least two boys and one girl to satisfy the condition for each child. Let's break it down:
- The first boy has two brothers (himself and another boy).
- The second boy has two brothers (the first boy and himself).
- The girl has at least one sister (herself or another girl).

To satisfy the condition for the girl, we need at least one girl. Therefore, the minimum configuration is two boys and one girl. This gives us a total of three children.
