Reasoning:
To determine in which box the probability of drawing a blue ball is the greatest, we need to calculate the probability of drawing a blue ball from each box. The probability of drawing a blue ball from a box is given by the formula:

\[ P(\text{blue}) = \frac{\text{number of blue balls}}{\text{total number of balls}} \]

Let's calculate the probability for each box:

- Box (A): 10 blues, 8 reds
  \[ P(\text{blue}) = \frac{10}{10 + 8} = \frac{10}{18} \approx 0.556 \]

- Box (B): 6 blues, 4 reds
  \[ P(\text{blue}) = \frac{6}{6 + 4} = \frac{6}{10} = 0.6 \]

- Box (C): 8 blues, 6 reds
  \[ P(\text{blue}) = \frac{8}{8 + 6} = \frac{8}{14} \approx 0.571 \]

- Box (D): 7 blues, 7 reds
  \[ P(\text{blue}) = \frac{7}{7 + 7} = \frac{7}{14} = 0.5 \]

- Box (E): 12 blues, 9 reds
  \[ P(\text{blue}) = \frac{12}{12 + 9} = \frac{12}{21} \approx 0.571 \]

Comparing the probabilities:
- Box (A): 0.556
- Box (B): 0.6
- Box (C): 0.571
- Box (D): 0.5
- Box (E): 0.571

The highest probability is 0.6, which corresponds to Box (B).

Answer: B
