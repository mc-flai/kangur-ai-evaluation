### Reasoning:
Lisa needs exactly 3 pieces to complete her jigsaw. We need to determine which of the 4 pieces left over will not be used.

1. First, we need to understand the shape and size of the pieces required to complete the jigsaw.
2. By examining the pieces labeled A, B, C, D, and the empty space, we can deduce which piece does not fit into the remaining space.
3. Piece A is light blue and has a distinct shape with 4 protruding parts.
4. Piece B is purple and has a similar shape to A but with different colors.
5. Piece C is green and has a similar shape to A and B.
6. Piece D is black and has a similar shape to A, B, and C.
7. The empty space in the jigsaw puzzle has a distinct shape that can accommodate pieces with 4 protruding parts.
8. By comparing the shapes of the pieces with the empty space, we can determine which piece does not fit.

Upon examining the shapes, it is clear that pieces A, B, C, and D all have the same shape and can fit into the empty space. Therefore, any of these pieces could be the one left over.
