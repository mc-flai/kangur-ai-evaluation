### Reasoning:
To determine the number of real solutions to the equation \(2^{2x} = 4^{x+1}\), we can start by expressing both sides of the equation with a common base. Since \(4 = 2^2\), we can rewrite \(4^{x+1}\) as \((2^2)^{x+1} = 2^{2(x+1)} = 2^{2x+2}\).

Now the equation becomes:
\[2^{2x} = 2^{2x+2}\]

By comparing the exponents on both sides, we get:
\[2x = 2x + 2\]

Subtract \(2x\) from both sides to isolate the constant term:
\[0 = 2\]

This equation has no solution, indicating that the original equation has no real solutions.
