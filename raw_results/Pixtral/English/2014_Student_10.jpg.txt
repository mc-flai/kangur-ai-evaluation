Reasoning:
1. We need to find a year where all digits are different and the last digit is greater than the sum of the other three digits.
2. Let's denote the year as 20ab, where a, b are the digits.
3. The condition is that the last digit (b) must be greater than the sum of the first three digits (2, 0, a).
4. We start by checking the smallest possible value for a and b that satisfies the condition.

   - For a = 0, b must be greater than 2 (sum of 2, 0).
   - The smallest b that satisfies this is 3.

   - Year: 2003
   - Check: 3 > 2 + 0 + 0 (which is 2)

   This condition is satisfied for the year 2003.

5. We need to determine how many years ago 2003 was from 2014.
   - 2014 - 2003 = 11 years.

Answer: D
