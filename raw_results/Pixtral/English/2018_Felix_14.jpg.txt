Reasoning: Each ice-lolly stick is 5 cm long and 1 cm wide. To determine the total length of Susi's pattern, we need to count the number of sticks used horizontally across the pattern. The pattern shows a repeating structure of sticks arranged in a grid-like fashion. By counting the horizontal sticks, we can calculate the total length.

Upon examining the pattern, we observe that there are 5 horizontal sticks in the pattern. Each stick is 5 cm long. Therefore, the total length of the pattern is calculated as follows:
\[ 5 \text{ sticks} \times 5 \text{ cm per stick} = 25 \text{ cm} \]
