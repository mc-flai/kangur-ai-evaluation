### Reasoning:
1. The circle has a radius of 1, which means its total circumference is \(2\pi\).
2. The circle rolls from point \(K\) to point \(L\) along a straight line, covering a distance of \(11\pi\).
3. Since the circumference of the circle is \(2\pi\), each complete rotation the circle makes covers a distance of \(2\pi\).
4. To determine how many complete rotations the circle makes, we divide the total distance by the circumference:
   \[
   \text{Number of rotations} = \frac{11\pi}{2\pi} = 5.5
   \]
5. This means the circle completes 5 full rotations and an additional half rotation.
6. After 5 full rotations, the circle returns to its starting orientation.
7. During the additional half rotation, the circle will have its shaded portion move to the position it would be in after half a rotation.
