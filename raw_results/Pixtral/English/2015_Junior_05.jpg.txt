### Reasoning:
Mr. Hide buried the treasure at least 5 meters away from the hedge and no more than 5 meters away from the old pear tree. This means the area where the treasure could be located is within a circular region centered between these two points, extending 5 meters from both the hedge and the tree.

Let's analyze each option:
- **Option A**: The shaded area is too far from the hedge and the tree.
- **Option B**: The shaded area is too far from the hedge and the tree.
- **Option C**: The shaded area is too far from the hedge and the tree.
- **Option D**: The shaded area is within 5 meters from both the hedge and the tree.
- **Option E**: The shaded area is too far from the hedge and the tree.

Based on the given constraints, the correct answer is **Option D**, which shows the area where the treasure is most likely buried.

### Answer:
D
