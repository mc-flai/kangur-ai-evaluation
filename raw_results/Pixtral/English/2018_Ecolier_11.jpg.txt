Reasoning: To determine the smallest number of shapes Tom needs to completely cover his paper boat, we need to analyze the shape of the boat and the given shapes. The boat has a triangular section at the front and back, and a rectangular section in the middle. The shapes provided are a small square and a triangular shape that can cover part of the boat's triangular section.

1. The triangular section at the front and back of the boat can be covered by the triangular shapes.
2. The rectangular section in the middle of the boat can be covered by the small square shapes.

By placing the triangular shapes at the front and back, we cover the triangular sections. Then, we can use the small square shapes to cover the rectangular section in the middle. Since the boat's dimensions are such that the triangular sections are smaller than the rectangular section, we need fewer triangular shapes to cover the triangular sections compared to the number of small square shapes needed for the rectangular section.

Answer: C)
