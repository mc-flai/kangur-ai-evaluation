Reasoning: The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Since cylinders A and B have the same volume, we can set their volume equations equal to each other. Let the radius of cylinder A be r and the height be h. The radius of cylinder B is 1.1r (10% larger). The volume equations are:

πr²h = π(1.1r)²h'

Setting these equal gives:

r²h = (1.1r)²h'

Simplifying, we get:

h = 1.21h'

This means the height of cylinder A is 21% greater than that of cylinder B.

Answer: E)
