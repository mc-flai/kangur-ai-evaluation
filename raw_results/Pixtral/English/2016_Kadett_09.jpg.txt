### Reasoning:

Alex has two ropes, one of 1 meter and one of 2 meters. He cuts them into pieces of equal length. To determine the number of pieces he cannot obtain, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1 and 2, which is 1. This means the smallest piece he can cut is 1 meter.

The total length of the rope is 1 + 2 = 3 meters. If he cuts the ropes into pieces of 1 meter each, he can get 3 pieces. Therefore, any number of pieces greater than 3 cannot be obtained.

Let's check the options:
- (A) 6: Not possible because the maximum number of pieces is 3.
- (B) 8: Not possible because the maximum number of pieces is 3.
- (C) 9: Not possible because the maximum number of pieces is 3.
- (D) 12: Not possible because the maximum number of pieces is 3.
- (E) 15: Not possible because the maximum number of pieces is 3.

### Answer: A), B), C), D), or E). A
