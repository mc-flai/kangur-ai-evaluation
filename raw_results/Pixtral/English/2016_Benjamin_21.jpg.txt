Reasoning: The image shows a partially completed large triangle composed of smaller identical triangles. To determine the minimum number of additional small triangles Clara needs to add to complete the large triangle, we need to count the total number of small triangles in the complete large triangle and subtract the number of small triangles that have already been placed.

The large triangle is composed of 7 rows of small triangles. The number of small triangles in each row forms an arithmetic sequence starting with 1 triangle at the top and increasing by 1 triangle for each subsequent row. Therefore, the sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

To find the total number of small triangles in the large triangle, we sum these numbers:
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28

The image shows that some small triangles have already been placed. By counting the placed triangles, we find that 11 small triangles have already been placed.

Therefore, the minimum number of additional small triangles Clara needs to add is:
28 (total) - 11 (already placed) = 17

Answer: D)
