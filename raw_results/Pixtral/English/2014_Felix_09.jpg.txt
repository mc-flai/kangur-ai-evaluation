Reasoning: The problem states that a rectangle has been cut into two pieces. One piece is shown at the top, which has a jagged edge with multiple peaks and valleys. To find the other piece, we need to consider what would complement this jagged edge to form the original rectangle. The correct piece will have an edge that matches the shown piece when put together.

- Option (A): This piece has a jagged edge that does not match the shown piece.
- Option (B): This piece has a jagged edge that matches the shown piece when put together.
- Option (C): This piece has a jagged edge that does not match the shown piece.
- Option (D): This piece has a jagged edge that does not match the shown piece.
- Option (E): This piece has a jagged edge that does not match the shown piece.
