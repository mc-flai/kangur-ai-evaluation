Reasoning: The image shows a circle and a square with numbers inside them. To determine how many numbers are outside the square, we need to count the numbers that are not within either the circle or the square.

- The circle contains the numbers 52, 9, 48, and 21.
- The square contains the numbers 9, 21, 24, and 36.

By combining the numbers in both shapes, we get the set: {52, 9, 48, 21, 24, 36}. To find the numbers outside the square, we need to exclude the numbers inside the square from the total set.

Total numbers in both shapes: {52, 9, 48, 21, 24, 36}
Numbers inside the square: {9, 21, 24, 36}

Excluding the numbers inside the square from the total set:
{52, 48} are the numbers outside the square.

Therefore, the number of numbers outside the square is 2.
