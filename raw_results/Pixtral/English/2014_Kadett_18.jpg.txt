### Reasoning:
1. We start with a rectangle that has sides of 6 cm and 11 cm.
2. One of the long sides (11 cm) is selected, and angle bisectors are drawn from the ends of this side.
3. These angle bisectors divide the opposite long side into three pieces.
4. To find the lengths of these pieces, we use the property of angle bisectors in a rectangle. The angle bisectors of the angles at the ends of one side will divide the opposite side into segments proportional to the lengths of the sides of the rectangle.
5. The lengths of the segments on the opposite side will be in the ratio of the lengths of the sides of the rectangle, which is 6:11.
6. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the three segments on the opposite side must be 6 cm.
7. We need to find three numbers that add up to 6 cm and are in the ratio 6:11.

Let's denote the lengths of the three segments as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). According to the ratio 6:11, we have:
\[ a : b : c = 6 : 11 \]

The sum of the segments is:
\[ a + b + c = 6 \]

To find the actual lengths, we can express \(b\) and \(c\) in terms of \(a\):
\[ b = \frac{11}{6}a \]
\[ c = \frac{11}{6}a \]

Substituting these into the sum equation:
\[ a + \frac{11}{6}a + \frac{11}{6}a = 6 \]
\[ a + \frac{11}{6}a + \frac{11}{6}a = 6 \]
\[ a + \frac{22}{6}a = 6 \]
\[ a + \frac{11}{3}a = 6 \]
\[ \frac{4a + 11a}{3} = 6 \]
\[ \frac{15a}{3} = 6 \]
\[ 5a = 6 \]
\[ a = \frac{6}{5} \]

Now, we find \(b\) and \(c\):
\[ b = \frac{11}{6} \times \frac{6}{5} = \frac{11}{5} \]
\[ c = \frac{11}{6} \times \frac{6}{5} = \frac{11}{5} \]

Thus, the lengths of the three segments are:
\[ a = \frac{6}{5} \]
\[ b = \frac{11}{5} \]
\[ c = \frac{11}{5} \]

Converting these to centimeters:
\[ a = 1.2 \text{ cm} \]
\[ b = 2.2 \text{ cm} \]
\[ c = 2.2 \text{ cm} \]

### Answer: B
