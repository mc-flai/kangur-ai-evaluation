### Reasoning:
1. The diagram shows Maria's square tablecloth with small light squares that are equally big and have diagonals parallel to the sides of the tablecloth.
2. To determine the percentage of the tablecloth that is black, we need to count the number of black squares and divide it by the total number of squares in the tablecloth.
3. The tablecloth has a border of black squares around a central white square.
4. By counting the black squares, we can see that the border consists of 4 rows of black squares around the central white square.
5. If we assume the tablecloth is a 5x5 grid (4 black rows around a 1x1 central white square), the total number of squares is 25.
6. The number of black squares is 20 (4 rows on each side, each row containing 5 squares).
7. The percentage of black squares is calculated as (20/25) * 100 = 80%.

### Answer:
None of the given options match the calculated percentage. However, the closest option is D) 32%.
