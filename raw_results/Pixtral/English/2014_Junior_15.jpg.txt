### Reasoning:
1. Let's denote the total length of the crocodile as \( L \).
2. According to the problem, the length of the tail is one-third of the total length of the crocodile. Therefore, the length of the tail is \( \frac{L}{3} \).
3. The head is 93 cm long and makes up one-quarter of the length of the crocodile without its tail. This means the length of the body (without the tail) is four times the length of the head. So, the length of the body is \( 4 \times 93 \) cm.
4. The total length of the crocodile is the sum of the length of the body and the length of the tail. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   L = 4 \times 93 + \frac{L}{3}
   \]
5. To solve for \( L \), first isolate \( \frac{L}{3} \):
   \[
   L - \frac{L}{3} = 4 \times 93
   \]
6. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   \frac{3L - L}{3} = 372
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2L}{3} = 372
   \]
7. Multiply both sides by 3 and then divide by 2 to solve for \( L \):
   \[
   2L = 1116
   \]
   \[
   L = 558
   \]
