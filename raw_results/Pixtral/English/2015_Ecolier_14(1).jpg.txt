### Reasoning:
Peter starts at point S and follows the directions of the arrows, turning right at the first crossing, then left at the next, and so on. We need to follow his path step-by-step to determine which crossing he does not reach.

1. Start at S.
2. Move to the first crossing (turn right) -> Reach point A.
3. Move to the next crossing (turn left) -> Reach point B.
4. Move to the next crossing (turn right) -> Reach point C.
5. Move to the next crossing (turn left) -> Reach point D.
6. Move to the next crossing (turn right) -> Reach point A again.

Following this sequence, we see that Peter does not reach the crossing labeled E.

### Answer: E
