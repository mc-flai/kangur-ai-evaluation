### Reasoning:
The problem asks us to determine the appearance of a solid made from 8 identical cubes when viewed from above. To solve this, we need to visualize how the cubes are arranged in each option and then determine which arrangement would look like when viewed from a top-down perspective.

- **Option A**: This arrangement has 3 cubes stacked vertically. When viewed from above, it would appear as a single square.
- **Option B**: This arrangement has 4 cubes in a 2x2 square formation with an additional cube below. When viewed from above, it would appear as a 2x2 square.
- **Option C**: This arrangement has 3 cubes in a horizontal line with an additional cube below. When viewed from above, it would appear as a single square.
- **Option D**: This arrangement has 3 cubes in a vertical line. When viewed from above, it would appear as a single square.
- **Option E**: This arrangement has 3 cubes in a horizontal line with an additional cube below. When viewed from above, it would appear as a single square.

Given that the solid is made of 8 identical cubes, the correct arrangement should have a top view that accounts for all 8 cubes.
