### Reasoning:

We are given the following equations involving real numbers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\):

1. \(a + 5 = b^2 - 1\)
2. \(b^2 - 1 = c^2 + 3\)
3. \(c^2 + 3 = d - 4\)

From these equations, we can deduce the following relationships:

1. \(a + 5 = c^2 + 3\)
2. \(a + 5 = d - 4\)

Let's solve for \(a\), \(c\), and \(d\):

From \(a + 5 = c^2 + 3\):

\[ a = c^2 + 3 - 5 \]
\[ a = c^2 - 2 \]

From \(a + 5 = d - 4\):

\[ a = d - 9 \]

Equating the two expressions for \(a\):

\[ c^2 - 2 = d - 9 \]
\[ c^2 - d = 11 \]

Now, let's solve for \(b\):

From \(b^2 - 1 = c^2 + 3\):

\[ b^2 = c^2 + 4 \]
\[ b^2 = (c + 2)(c - 2) \]

Since \(b\) is a real number, \(c + 2\) and \(c - 2\) must both be non-negative or non-positive. This implies \(c\) is between -2 and 2.

Given \(c^2 - d = 11\), we can find the range of \(d\):

\[ d = c^2 - 11 \]

Since \(c\) is between -2 and 2, \(c^2\) is between 0 and 4. Therefore, \(d\) is between -7 and 3.

Now, let's find the range of \(a\):

\[ a = c^2 - 2 \]

Since \(c^2\) is between 0 and 4, \(a\) is between -2 and 2.

Next, let's find the range of \(b\):

\[ b^2 = (c + 2)(c - 2) \]

Since \(c\) is between -2 and 2, \((c + 2)(c - 2)\) is between 0 and 16. Therefore, \(b\) is between -4 and 4.

Finally, let's find the range of \(d\):

\[ d = c^2 - 11 \]

Since \(c^2\) is between 0 and 4, \(d\) is between -7 and -7.

Comparing the ranges:

- \(a\) is between -2 and 2.
- \(b\) is between -4 and 4.
- \(c\) is between -2 and 2.
- \(d\) is between -7 and -7.

Clearly, \(d\) is the smallest number.
