Reasoning: The problem states that the symbols represent the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. We need to determine which symbol corresponds to the digit 3. By analyzing the given equations:
- The first equation shows that the symbol for the atom (C) plus the symbol for the atom (C) equals the symbol for the fish (E).
- The second equation shows that the symbol for the sun (B) plus the symbol for the sun (B) equals the symbol for the atom (C).
- The third equation shows that the symbol for the sun (B) plus the symbol for the fish (E) equals the symbol for the triple bars (D).

From these equations, we can deduce that the symbol for the digit 3 must be the one that appears in the middle of the equations, which is the atom (C).

Answer: C)
