### Reasoning:

1. We have five balls with weights: 30 g, 50 g, 50 g, 50 g, and 80 g.
2. We need to determine which set of balls weighs 30 g.
3. By examining the balance scales, we can see which combinations balance out to 30 g.
4. The first balance shows C and D on the left and A and B on the right. This does not balance because 30 g is not a combination of the given weights.
5. The second balance shows A and C on the left and E and B on the right. This does not balance because 30 g is not a combination of the given weights.
6. The third balance shows A and D on the left and E and C on the right. This does not balance because 30 g is not a combination of the given weights.
7. The fourth balance shows A, Y, and D on the left and E, C, and B on the right. This does not balance because 30 g is not a combination of the given weights.
8. The fifth balance shows E, C, and B on the left and A, Y, and D on the right. This does not balance because 30 g is not a combination of the given weights.
9. Therefore, none of the given combinations balance to 30 g.

### Answer: None of the given options (A, B, C, D, E) balance to 30 g.
