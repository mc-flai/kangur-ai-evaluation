To determine through which door Eva leaves the house, we need to follow the rule that each room she enters has a number higher than the previous one. Let's analyze the given options step-by-step:

1. **Option A (A)**: The sequence of numbers does not follow the rule of increasing numbers.
2. **Option B (B)**: The sequence of numbers does not follow the rule of increasing numbers.
3. **Option C (C)**: The sequence of numbers does not follow the rule of increasing numbers.
4. **Option D (D)**: The sequence of numbers does not follow the rule of increasing numbers.
5. **Option E (E)**: The sequence of numbers follows the rule of increasing numbers: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 6, 9, 8, 9, 12.

Reasoning:
- We need to find a sequence where each room number is higher than the previous one.
- Option E is the only sequence that follows this rule.

Answer: E
