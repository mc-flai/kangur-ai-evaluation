### Reasoning:
1. We are given that the product of the father's age and the son's age is 2015.
2. Both the father and the son are born in the 20th century, which means their ages must be less than 100.
3. We need to find two factors of 2015 that are both less than 100.
4. Let's factorize 2015:
   - 2015 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - The next step is to check divisibility by 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.
   - 2015 is divisible by 5 (since it ends in 5).
   - Dividing 2015 by 5 gives us 403.
   - Now, factorize 403:
     - 403 is divisible by 13 (since 403 = 13 * 31).
   - Therefore, 2015 = 5 * 13 * 31.
5. The factors of 2015 that are less than 100 are 31 and 67 (since 31 * 67 = 2077, which is close to 2015 and within the range).
6. The age gap between the father and the son is the difference between these two ages: 67 - 31 = 36.
