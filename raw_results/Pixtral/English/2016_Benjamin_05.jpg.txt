Reasoning: When Kathi draws a square with a side length of 10 cm, the midpoints of each side are joined to form a smaller square. The side length of the smaller square is half the side length of the original square. Therefore, the side length of the smaller square is 10 cm / 2 = 5 cm. The area of a square is calculated by squaring the side length. Thus, the area of the smaller square is 5 cm * 5 cm = 25 cmÂ².

Answer: C)
