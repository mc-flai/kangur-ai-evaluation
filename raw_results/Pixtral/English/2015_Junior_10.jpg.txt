### Reasoning:

1. A pentagon is defined as convex if all its internal angles are less than 180 degrees.
2. The sum of the internal angles of any pentagon is 540 degrees.
3. Since a convex pentagon has all internal angles less than 180 degrees, each angle must be an acute angle.
4. Acute angles are less than 90 degrees.
5. The number of right angles in a convex pentagon must be zero because a right angle (90 degrees) is not less than 90 degrees and would violate the convexity condition.
6. Therefore, the only possible value for the number of right angles in a convex pentagon is zero.
