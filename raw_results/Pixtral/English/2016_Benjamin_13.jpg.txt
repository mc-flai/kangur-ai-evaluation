Reasoning:
1. Let's denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B. According to the problem, there are 30 students in total, so G + B = 30.
2. We know that every boy shares a desk with a girl, so the number of boys B must be equal to the number of desks.
3. Exactly half the girls share a desk with a boy. This means that half of the girls (G/2) share a desk with a boy, and the other half (G/2) do not share a desk with a boy.
4. Since every boy shares a desk with a girl, and each desk is shared by two students, the number of boys B must be equal to the number of girls who share a desk with a boy (G/2).
5. Therefore, B = G/2.
6. Substituting B = G/2 into the total number of students equation G + B = 30, we get G + (G/2) = 30.
7. Simplifying this equation, we get (3/2)G = 30.
8. Solving for G, we get G = 30 * (2/3) = 20.
9. Since B = G/2, we get B = 20/2 = 10.

Answer: D
