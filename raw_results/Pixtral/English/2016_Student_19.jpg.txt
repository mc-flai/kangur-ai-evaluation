### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have a diagram with ten points, each labeled with one of the numbers 0, 1, or 2.
   - The sum of the numbers in the corner points of each white triangle is divisible by 3.
   - The sum of the numbers in the corner points of each black triangle is not divisible by 3.
   - Three points are already labeled as shown in the diagram.

2. **Analyzing the White Triangles**:
   - Let's denote the three points already labeled as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
   - For a white triangle to have a sum divisible by 3, the sum of the numbers at its corners must be 0, 3, 6, 9, etc.
   - Possible sums for three numbers (0, 1, 2) that are divisible by 3 are: 0+0+0, 0+1+2, 1+1+1, 2+2+0.

3. **Analyzing the Black Triangles**:
   - For a black triangle to have a sum not divisible by 3, the sum of the numbers at its corners must be 1, 2, 4, 5, etc.
   - Possible sums for three numbers (0, 1, 2) that are not divisible by 3 are: 0+1+2, 1+0+2, 2+0+1.

4. **Determining the Inner Point**:
   - We need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in the corner points of each white triangle is divisible by 3.
   - Let's consider the possible numbers for the inner point (denoted as \(?\)) and check the sums.

5. **Checking Possible Combinations**:
   - If the inner point is labeled 0:
     - Possible sums for the white triangles: 0+0+0, 0+1+2, 1+1+1, 2+2+0.
     - Possible sums for the black triangles: 0+1+2, 1+0+2, 2+0+1.
   - If the inner point is labeled 1:
     - Possible sums for the white triangles: 0+0+0, 0+1+2, 1+1+1, 2+2+0.
     - Possible sums for the black triangles: 0+1+2, 1+0+2, 2+0+1.
   - If the inner point is labeled 2:
     - Possible sums for the white triangles: 0+0+0, 0+1+2, 1+1+1, 2+2+0.
     - Possible sums for the black triangles: 0+1+2, 1+0+2, 2+0+1.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - All possible combinations (0, 1, 2) for the inner point satisfy the conditions for both white and black triangles.
   - Therefore, the inner point can be labeled with any of the numbers 0, 1, or 2.
