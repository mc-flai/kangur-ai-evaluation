**Reasoning:**
1. Anita has built fewer sandcastles than Hans but more than Steffan.
2. Fabian has built more sandcastles than Anita and more than Hans.
3. Bruno has built more sandcastles than Hans but less than Fabian.

From these statements, we can deduce the following:
- Fabian has built more sandcastles than Anita.
- Fabian has built more sandcastles than Hans.
- Bruno has built more sandcastles than Hans but less than Fabian.

Therefore, the person who has built the most sandcastles is Fabian.

**Answer:** E) Fabian
