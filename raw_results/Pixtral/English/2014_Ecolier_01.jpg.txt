### Reasoning:
When Luisa cuts out a piece from the middle of a star drawing, the resulting shape will be a geometric figure that has straight edges radiating from the center. The options provided are different geometric shapes with varying numbers of straight edges.

- Option (A) has 5 straight edges.
- Option (B) has 6 straight edges.
- Option (C) has 7 straight edges.
- Option (D) has 8 straight edges.
- Option (E) has 9 straight edges.

The large image on the right has more than 9 straight edges, indicating it is not a simple cut-out piece but a more complex shape.

Given that the piece cut out from the middle of a star typically results in a shape with a manageable number of straight edges, the most likely option is the one with 7 straight edges.

### Answer: C)
