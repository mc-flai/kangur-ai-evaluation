**Reasoning**:
1. Paul starts his hike on Monday and finishes on Friday, which means he hikes for 5 days.
2. Each day he covers 2 km more than the previous day.
3. Let's denote the distance covered on the first day as \( x \) km.
4. The distances for the subsequent days will be \( x + 2 \) km, \( x + 4 \) km, \( x + 6 \) km, and \( x + 8 \) km.
5. The total distance covered over the 5 days is the sum of these distances:
   \[
   x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 70 \text{ km}
   \]
6. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   5x + 20 = 70
   \]
7. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   5x = 50 \implies x = 10
   \]
8. Therefore, the distances for each day are:
   - Day 1: 10 km
   - Day 2: 12 km
   - Day 3: 14 km
   - Day 4: 16 km
   - Day 5: 18 km
9. The distance covered on Thursday is 14 km.
