### Reasoning:
1. Initially, 13 children registered for the competition.
2. Then, another 19 children joined, making a total of 13 + 19 = 32 children.
3. To form six equally big teams, we need to divide the total number of children by 6.
4. Performing the division, 32 รท 6 = 5 with a remainder of 2.
5. This means that 32 children are not enough to form six equally big teams without any remainder.
6. To form six equally big teams with no remainder, we need to add enough children to make the total number of children a multiple of 6.
7. The next multiple of 6 after 32 is 36 (since 36 รท 6 = 6).
8. Therefore, we need 36 - 32 = 4 more children.
