**Reasoning:**
1. Ingrid has a total of 10 cubes: 4 red, 3 blue, 2 green, and 1 yellow.
2. The condition states that cubes of the same color do not touch each other.
3. We need to determine the color of the cube with the question mark in the structure.

To solve this, we need to consider the placement of each color cube while ensuring no two cubes of the same color touch each other.

- **Red cubes:** There are 4 red cubes. They must be placed such that no two red cubes are adjacent.
- **Blue cubes:** There are 3 blue cubes. They also need to be placed such that no two blue cubes are adjacent.
- **Green cubes:** There are 2 green cubes. Similarly, they must be placed such that no two green cubes are adjacent.
- **Yellow cube:** There is only 1 yellow cube, so its placement is less restrictive compared to the others.

Given the structure, we need to place the cubes in a way that satisfies the condition. Let's assume the structure is a pyramid-like arrangement:

- Bottom layer: 4 cubes (one of each color)
- Second layer: 3 cubes (one of each color)
- Third layer: 2 cubes (one of each color)
- Top layer: 1 cube (one of each color)

If we follow this arrangement, the cube with the question mark must be placed in a position where it does not violate the condition of no two cubes of the same color touching each other.

- The bottom layer has one of each color.
- The second layer has one of each color.
- The third layer has one of each color.
- The top layer has one of each color.

Since the arrangement is symmetric and each layer has one of each color, the cube with the question mark must be yellow because it is the only color with only one cube available.

**Answer:** D) Yellow
