### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a right-angled triangle \(ABC\) with the right angle at \(A\).
   - The angle bisectors of the acute angles intersect at point \(P\).
   - The distance of \(P\) to the hypotenuse is given as \(\sqrt{8}\).
   - We need to find the distance of \(P\) to \(A\).

2. **Properties of Angle Bisectors**:
   - In a right-angled triangle, the angle bisectors of the acute angles intersect at the incenter of the triangle.
   - The incenter is equidistant from all sides of the triangle.

3. **Distance to the Hypotenuse**:
   - Given that the distance of \(P\) to the hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{8}\), we can infer that this distance is the inradius of the triangle.

4. **Finding the Distance to \(A\)**:
   - Since \(P\) is the incenter, the distance from \(P\) to \(A\) is the inradius of the triangle.
   - The inradius \(r\) of a right-angled triangle can be calculated using the formula \(r = \frac{a + b - c}{2}\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the legs and \(c\) is the hypotenuse.

5. **Using the Given Information**:
   - Let's assume the legs of the triangle are \(a\) and \(b\), and the hypotenuse is \(c\).
   - Given \(r = \sqrt{8}\), we need to find the distance from \(P\) to \(A\).

6. **Calculating the Distance**:
   - Since \(P\) is the incenter, the distance from \(P\) to \(A\) is simply the inradius \(r\).
   - Therefore, the distance of \(P\) to \(A\) is \(\sqrt{8}\).
