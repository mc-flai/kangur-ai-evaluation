Reasoning: To determine which squirrel gets a second nut, we need to analyze the positions of the squirrels and the nuts. The squirrels start running to the nearest nut at the same time and with the same speed. The first squirrel to reach a nut will immediately continue to the next nearest nut. By examining the positions, we can determine which squirrel will be in a position to collect a second nut.

1. Squirrel A is closest to the first nut.
2. Squirrel B is next to Squirrel A and will get the second nut.
3. Squirrel C is next to Squirrel B and will get the third nut.
4. Squirrel D is next to Squirrel C and will get the fourth nut.
5. Squirrel E is next to Squirrel D and will get the fifth nut.

Therefore, Squirrel B will be the one to get a second nut.

Answer: B
