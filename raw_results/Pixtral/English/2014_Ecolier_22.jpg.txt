### Reasoning:
To determine which digit must be written in the grey box to make the sum correct, we need to analyze the given digits and the sum. The sum is represented by the plus sign and the grey box. The digits available are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Each digit is used only once.

Let's consider the possible sums with the given digits:

1. If the grey box contains 2, the sum would be 10 (since 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10).
2. If the grey box contains 3, the sum would be 11 (since 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11).
3. If the grey box contains 4, the sum would be 12 (since 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12).
4. If the grey box contains 5, the sum would be 13 (since 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 = 13).
5. If the grey box contains 6, the sum would be 14 (since 0 + 1 + 3 + 6 + 4 = 14).

Given the options, we need to find which digit results in a sum that matches the given sum. The correct sum is 13, which corresponds to the digit 5.
