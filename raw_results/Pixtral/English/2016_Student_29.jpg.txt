### Reasoning:
1. We start with a 5x5 grid of 25 fields, all initially white.
2. To achieve the chessboard coloring shown in the diagram, we need to alternate colors between adjacent fields.
3. Each move allows us to change the color of three adjacent fields in a horizontal or vertical line.
4. To determine the smallest number of moves, we need to count the number of fields that need to be changed from white to black or black to white to achieve the desired pattern.
5. By examining the pattern, we can see that there are 12 black fields and 13 white fields in the final configuration.
6. To convert all white fields to black and vice versa, we need to perform a series of moves that will change the color of the fields in such a way that we achieve the desired pattern.
7. We can start by changing the color of three fields at a time, ensuring that each move contributes to the final pattern.
8. By strategically planning the moves, we can achieve the chessboard pattern in the minimum number of moves.

### Answer:
C) 12
