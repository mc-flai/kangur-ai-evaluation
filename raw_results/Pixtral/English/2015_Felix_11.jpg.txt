Reasoning: To determine how many sweets Katharina has to give to Julia so that they both have the same amount, we need to find the difference between their current number of sweets and then divide that difference by 2. Julia has 9 sweets, and Katharina has 17 sweets. The difference between their sweets is 17 - 9 = 8. To make the number of sweets equal, we divide this difference by 2, which gives us 8 / 2 = 4. Therefore, Katharina needs to give 4 sweets to Julia.
