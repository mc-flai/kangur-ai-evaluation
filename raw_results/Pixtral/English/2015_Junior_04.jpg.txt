Reasoning:
1. First, calculate the total amount of money paid by Anna, Beate, and Cindy.
   - Anna paid 80 cents.
   - Beate paid 50 cents.
   - Cindy paid 20 cents.
   - Total amount paid = 80 + 50 + 20 = 150 cents.

2. Next, determine the total number of biscuits they bought, which is 30.

3. Calculate the cost per biscuit.
   - Cost per biscuit = Total amount paid / Total number of biscuits = 150 cents / 30 biscuits = 5 cents per biscuit.

4. Determine the number of biscuits each person should get based on the amount they paid.
   - Anna paid 80 cents, so she should get 80 / 5 = 16 biscuits.
   - Beate paid 50 cents, so she should get 50 / 5 = 10 biscuits.
   - Cindy paid 20 cents, so she should get 20 / 5 = 4 biscuits.

5. Calculate the difference between the number of biscuits Anna actually got and the number she should have got if they had shared them in proportion.
   - Anna actually got 10 biscuits.
   - Anna should have got 16 biscuits.
   - Difference = 16 - 10 = 6 biscuits.
