Reasoning:
1. The problem states that the quadrilateral ABCD has right angles only in corners A and D.
2. The numbers in the diagram represent the areas of the triangles in which they are located.
3. To find the area of triangle ABCD, we need to sum the areas of the triangles that make up the quadrilateral.
4. The triangles are T, S, and the triangle formed by points A, B, and T.
5. The area of triangle T is given as 5.
6. The area of triangle S is given as 10.
7. The area of the triangle formed by points A, B, and T is given as 5.
8. Summing these areas: 5 (area of T) + 10 (area of S) + 5 (area of the triangle ABT) = 20.
