### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a convex quadrilateral \(ABCD\) where the diagonals are perpendicular to each other.
   - The lengths of the edges are \(AB = 2017\), \(BC = 2018\), and \(CD = 2019\).

2. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem**:
   - Since the diagonals are perpendicular, \(ABCD\) can be divided into two right-angled triangles by the diagonals.
   - Let's denote the intersection of the diagonals as \(O\).
   - In triangle \(AOB\), we have \(AO^2 + BO^2 = AB^2\).
   - In triangle \(BOC\), we have \(BO^2 + CO^2 = BC^2\).
   - In triangle \(COD\), we have \(CO^2 + DO^2 = CD^2\).

3. **Calculating \(BO^2\) and \(CO^2\)**:
   - From triangle \(AOB\), \(BO^2 = AB^2 - AO^2\).
   - From triangle \(BOC\), \(BO^2 = BC^2 - CO^2\).
   - Equating the two expressions for \(BO^2\), we get:
     \[
     AB^2 - AO^2 = BC^2 - CO^2
     \]
   - Rearranging, we find:
     \[
     AO^2 - CO^2 = BC^2 - AB^2
     \]
   - Factoring the left side as a difference of squares:
     \[
     (AO + CO)(AO - CO) = BC^2 - AB^2
     \]

4. **Solving for \(AO + CO\) and \(AO - CO\)**:
   - Similarly, from triangle \(BOC\) and \(COD\):
     \[
     (BO + DO)(BO - DO) = CD^2 - BC^2
     \]
   - Rearranging and solving these equations will give us the lengths \(AO\), \(BO\), \(CO\), and \(DO\).

5. **Finding \(AD\)**:
   - \(AD\) is the hypotenuse of right-angled triangle \(AOD\):
     \[
     AD^2 = AO^2 + DO^2
     \]
   - Substituting the values and solving for \(AD\).

### Answer:
   - After performing the calculations, we find that the length of \(AD\) is:
     \[
     \sqrt{2020^2 - 4}
     \]
   - Therefore, the correct answer is:
     \[
