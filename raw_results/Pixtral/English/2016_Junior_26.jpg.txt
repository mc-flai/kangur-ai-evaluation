### Reasoning:
In a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. This is known as the triangle inequality theorem. Given that two heights of the triangle are 10 cm and 11 cm, we need to determine which of the given lengths cannot be the length of the third height.

Let's check each option against the triangle inequality theorem:

- **Option A) 5 cm**:
  - Check: 10 cm + 11 cm = 21 cm
  - 21 cm > 5 cm (satisfies the triangle inequality)

- **Option B) 6 cm**:
  - Check: 10 cm + 11 cm = 21 cm
  - 21 cm > 6 cm (satisfies the triangle inequality)

- **Option C) 7 cm**:
  - Check: 10 cm + 11 cm = 21 cm
  - 21 cm > 7 cm (satisfies the triangle inequality)

- **Option D) 10 cm**:
  - Check: 10 cm + 11 cm = 21 cm
  - 21 cm > 10 cm (satisfies the triangle inequality)

- **Option E) 100 cm**:
  - Check: 10 cm + 11 cm = 21 cm
  - 21 cm < 100 cm (does not satisfy the triangle inequality)

### Answer: E)
