Reasoning: The problem asks how many different ways the letters in the equation \( N \times U \times (M + B + E + R) = 33 \) can be replaced by different digits (0 through 9).

To solve this, we need to consider the constraints of the equation and the possible values for each letter.

1. **Understanding the Equation**:
   - The equation is \( N \times U \times (M + B + E + R) = 33 \).
   - Each letter represents a different digit from 0 to 9.
   - The product of \( N \times U \) and the sum \( M + B + E + R \) must equal 33.

2. **Possible Values for \( N \times U \)**:
   - Since \( N \times U \) must be a two-digit number, we need to find pairs of digits that multiply to give a number between 10 and 99.
   - Possible pairs are: (1, 33), (3, 11), (9, 3), etc.

3. **Possible Values for \( M + B + E + R \)**:
   - The sum \( M + B + E + R \) must be a single-digit number.
   - Possible sums are: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

4. **Finding Combinations**:
   - We need to find combinations of digits that satisfy both conditions.
   - For example, if \( N \times U = 9 \), then \( M + B + E + R \) must be 3.
   - Possible combinations are: (1, 2, 0, 0), (0, 1, 2, 0), etc.

5. **Counting the Combinations**:
   - We need to count all possible combinations of digits that satisfy the equation.
   - This involves checking each possible value of \( N \times U \) and finding corresponding sums \( M + B + E + R \).

After analyzing the possible combinations and constraints, we find that the number of different ways the letters can be replaced by different digits is:
