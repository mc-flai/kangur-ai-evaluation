### Reasoning:

1. We start with a 5x5x5 cube, which consists of \(5^3 = 125\) small 1x1x1 cubes.
2. The solid shown in the image has several equally high pillars built upon a common base.
3. To determine how many small cubes have been removed, we need to count the number of small cubes that remain in the solid.

Let's count the number of cubes in each visible layer of the solid:

- The bottom layer (base) has 5x5 = 25 cubes.
- The second layer from the bottom has 4x4 = 16 cubes.
- The third layer from the bottom has 3x3 = 9 cubes.
- The fourth layer from the bottom has 2x2 = 4 cubes.
- The top layer has 1x1 = 1 cube.

Adding these up, the total number of cubes remaining in the solid is:
\[ 25 + 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 55 \]

4. To find out how many cubes have been removed, we subtract the number of remaining cubes from the total number of cubes in the original 5x5x5 cube:
\[ 125 - 55 = 70 \]
