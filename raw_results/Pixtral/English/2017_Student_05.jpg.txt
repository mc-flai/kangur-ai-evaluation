### Reasoning:
To determine which piece does not belong, we need to analyze the characteristics of the graphs shown in each option (A) through (E). Quadratic functions typically have a parabolic shape that opens upwards or downwards. Let's examine each graph:

- **Graph (A):** This graph appears to be a linear function rather than a quadratic function. It does not show the curvature typical of a parabola.
- **Graph (B):** This graph shows a parabolic shape that opens upwards. It is consistent with the typical shape of a quadratic function.
- **Graph (C):** This graph shows a parabolic shape that opens downwards. It is consistent with the typical shape of a quadratic function.
- **Graph (D):** This graph shows a parabolic shape that opens downwards. It is consistent with the typical shape of a quadratic function.
- **Graph (E):** This graph shows a parabolic shape that opens downwards. It is consistent with the typical shape of a quadratic function.

Since graph (A) is linear and not parabolic, it does not belong to the set of quadratic functions.

A
