Reasoning:
1. Let's denote the initial number of blue frogs as B and the initial number of green frogs as G.
2. The initial ratio of blue frogs to green frogs is B/G.
3. After the changes, the number of blue frogs increases by 60%, so the new number of blue frogs is B + 0.60B = 1.60B.
4. The number of green frogs decreases by 60%, so the new number of green frogs is G - 0.60G = 0.40G.
5. The new ratio of blue frogs to green frogs is (1.60B) / (0.40G).
6. We are told that this new ratio matches the original ratio, so we have:
   (1.60B) / (0.40G) = B / G.
7. Simplifying the equation, we get:
   1.60 / 0.40 = 1.
8. This simplifies to 4 = 1, which is a contradiction, indicating that the total number of frogs must have remained constant to maintain the ratio.
9. Therefore, the total number of frogs has not changed.
