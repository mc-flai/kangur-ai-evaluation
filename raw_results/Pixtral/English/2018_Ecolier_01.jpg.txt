Reasoning:
1. We need to determine how many balloons are hit by the darts based on their trajectories and the given conditions.
2. Each dart continues in the same direction it had beforehand after hitting a balloon.
3. By analyzing the paths of the darts and the positions of the balloons, we can count the number of balloons each dart hits.

- Dart 1: Hits the first balloon and continues to hit the second balloon.
- Dart 2: Hits the third balloon and continues to hit the fourth balloon.
- Dart 3: Hits the fifth balloon and continues to hit the sixth balloon.

Thus, each dart hits exactly two balloons.
