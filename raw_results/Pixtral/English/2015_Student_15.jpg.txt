### Reasoning:
1. The geometric mean of a set of numbers is defined as the nth root of the product of all the numbers.
2. We are given that the geometric mean of three numbers is 3. This means that the cube root of the product of these three numbers is 3.
3. Similarly, the geometric mean of another set of three numbers is 12, which means that the cube root of the product of these three numbers is 12.
4. To find the geometric mean of all six numbers, we need to find the sixth root of the product of all six numbers.
5. We can calculate the product of the three sets of numbers separately and then find their combined product.
6. The product of the first three numbers (with a geometric mean of 3) is \(3^3 = 27\).
7. The product of the second three numbers (with a geometric mean of 12) is \(12^3 = 1728\).
8. The product of all six numbers is \(27 \times 1728 = 46656\).
9. The sixth root of 46656 is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \sqrt[6]{46656} = \sqrt[6]{2^6 \times 3^6} = 2^{6/6} \times 3^{6/6} = 2 \times 3 = 6
   \]
