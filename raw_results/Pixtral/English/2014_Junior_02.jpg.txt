Reasoning:
1. We know that the container ship MSC Fabiola carries 12500 identical long containers.
2. When these containers are placed next to each other in a row, they make a 75km long container line.
3. To find the length of one container, we divide the total length of the container line by the number of containers.

Calculation:
\[ \text{Length of one container} = \frac{75 \text{ km}}{12500} \]

\[ \text{Length of one container} = 0.006 \text{ km} \]

\[ \text{Length of one container} = 6 \text{ meters} \]

Answer: A)
