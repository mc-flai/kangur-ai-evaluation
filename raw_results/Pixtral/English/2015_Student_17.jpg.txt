### Reasoning:

Let's denote the initial population of Arnberg as \( A \) and the initial population of Berghausen as \( B \). According to the problem, the population of Arnberg increased by 40%, and the population of Berghausen increased by 60%. The combined increase in population for both villages is 54%.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

1. \( A + 0.40A = A(1 + 0.40) \) for Arnberg.
2. \( B + 0.60B = B(1 + 0.60) \) for Berghausen.
3. \( A(1 + 0.40) + B(1 + 0.60) = (A + B)(1 + 0.54) \) for the combined population.

From the combined population equation, we can simplify:

\[ A(1.40) + B(1.60) = (A + B)1.54 \]

Let's denote the initial ratio of the populations as \( \frac{A}{B} = R \). Then we can write:

\[ 1.40A + 1.60B = 1.54(A + B) \]

Substituting \( B = \frac{A}{R} \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 1.40A + 1.60 \left( \frac{A}{R} \right) = 1.54A + 1.54 \left( \frac{A}{R} \right) \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ 1.40A + \frac{1.60A}{R} = 1.54A + \frac{1.54A}{R} \]

\[ 1.40A + 1.60A - 1.54A - 1.54AR = 1.54A - 1.40A \]

\[ 0.06A = 0.14AR \]

\[ R = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \]

\[ R = \frac{3}{7} \]

So, the initial ratio of the populations \( \frac{A}{B} \) was 3:7.
