### Reasoning:
1. We need to determine which key corresponds to the padlock with the question mark.
2. Each letter on a padlock represents a unique digit, and the same letters mean the same digits.
3. We are given the following padlocks and their corresponding keys:
   - Padlock DAD with key 124
   - Padlock BHD with key 184
   - Padlock ABD with key ?
   - Padlock AHD with key ?
   - Padlock HAB with key ?
4. By comparing the keys, we can deduce the digits represented by each letter:
   - D = 1 (from DAD and 124)
   - A = 2 (from DAD and 124)
   - H = 8 (from BHD and 184)
   - B = 1 (from BHD and 184)
5. Using these values, we can determine the digits for the remaining padlocks:
   - ABD: A = 2, B = 1, D = 1 → 211
   - AHD: A = 2, H = 8, D = 1 → 281
   - HAB: H = 8, A = 2, B = 1 → 821
6. The key with the question mark must match the digits of the padlock ABD, which is 211.
