**Reasoning:**
1. Identify the total number of small squares in the figure. The figure appears to be a grid of squares.
2. Determine the constraints given in the problem. Specifically, no square made from four small grey squares should appear.
3. Count the possible squares that can be painted grey while ensuring that no 2x2 square of grey squares is formed.

Let's break it down:
- The figure has a total of 25 small squares.
- We need to avoid forming any 2x2 square of grey squares.
- Start by painting the squares from the top left corner, ensuring no 2x2 square is formed.

Painting the following squares grey:
1. Top left corner square
2. Second square in the first row
3. Second square in the second row
4. Third square in the first row
5. Third square in the second row
6. Fourth square in the first row
7. Fourth square in the second row
8. Fifth square in the first row
9. Fifth square in the second row
10. Sixth square in the first row
11. Sixth square in the second row
12. Seventh square in the first row
13. Seventh square in the second row
14. Eighth square in the first row
15. Eighth square in the second row
16. Ninth square in the first row
17. Ninth square in the second row
18. Tenth square in the first row

This configuration ensures that no 2x2 square of grey squares is formed.

**Answer:** A) 18
