### Reasoning:
To determine which picture shows a single large loop, we need to examine each option and identify the one where the loop is continuous and distinct from any smaller loops.

- **Option A**: This picture shows two separate loops, not a single large loop.
- **Option B**: This picture also shows two separate loops, not a single large loop.
- **Option C**: This picture shows two separate loops, not a single large loop.
- **Option D**: This picture shows two separate loops, not a single large loop.
- **Option E**: This picture shows a single continuous loop that encompasses the entire structure, making it a single large loop.

### Answer:
E
