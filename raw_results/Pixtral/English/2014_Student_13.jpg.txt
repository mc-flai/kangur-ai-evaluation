Reasoning:
1. We are given that the ratio of the radii of two concentric circles is 1:3. Let the radius of the smaller circle be \( r \). Therefore, the radius of the larger circle is \( 3r \).
2. The line AC is the diameter of the larger circle, so its length is \( 2 \times 3r = 6r \).
3. The chord BC of the larger circle touches the smaller circle. The length of the chord BC can be found using the formula for the length of a chord that touches a smaller circle inside a larger circle: \( 2 \sqrt{R^2 - r^2} \), where \( R \) is the radius of the larger circle and \( r \) is the radius of the smaller circle.
4. Given that the length of AB is 12, and AB is a straight line from A to B passing through the center C, we have \( AC + CB = 12 \).
5. Since AC is the diameter of the larger circle, \( AC = 6r \). Therefore, \( CB = 12 - 6r \).
6. Using the chord length formula, \( 2 \sqrt{(3r)^2 - r^2} = 2 \sqrt{9r^2 - r^2} = 2 \sqrt{8r^2} = 2 \times 2\sqrt{2}r = 4\sqrt{2}r \).
7. Equating the two expressions for CB, \( 12 - 6r = 4\sqrt{2}r \).
8. Solving for \( r \), we get \( 12 = 6r + 4\sqrt{2}r \).
9. Factoring out \( 6r \), we get \( 12 = 6r(1 + \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}) \).
10. Simplifying, \( 12 = 6r(1 + \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}) \).
11. Dividing both sides by 6, \( 2 = r(1 + \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}) \).
12. Solving for \( r \), \( r = \frac{2}{1 + \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}} \).
13. Simplifying further, \( r = \frac{2 \times 3}{3 + 2\sqrt{2}} \).
14. Rationalizing the denominator, \( r = \frac{6(3 - 2\sqrt{2})}{(3 + 2\sqrt{2})(3 - 2\sqrt{2})} \).
15. Simplifying, \( r = \frac{6(3 - 2\sqrt{2})}{9 - 8} = \frac{6(3 - 2\sqrt{2})}{1} = 6(3 - 2\sqrt{2}) \).
16. Therefore, the radius of the larger circle is \( 3r = 3 \times 6(3 - 2\sqrt{2}) = 18 - 12\sqrt{2} \).
