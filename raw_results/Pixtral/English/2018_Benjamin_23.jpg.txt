### Reasoning:

To determine the largest number of groups Nick can build so that the sum of the numbers in each group is equally big, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sums of the numbers. The numbers given are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. First, we calculate the total sum of these numbers:

\[ 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 54 \]

Next, we need to find the largest number of groups that can divide 54 equally. We check the divisors of 54:

\[ 54 = 1 \times 54 \]
\[ 54 = 2 \times 27 \]
\[ 54 = 3 \times 18 \]
\[ 54 = 6 \times 9 \]

The divisors of 54 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54. The largest divisor other than 54 itself is 9. This means the largest number of groups that can have an equal sum is 9.
