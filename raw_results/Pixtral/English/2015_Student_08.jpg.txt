Reasoning: To cover the outside of a truncated cone (a drinking glass) with colored paper without an overlap, the paper needs to be cut in a specific shape that matches the curved surface of the cone. The correct shape will be a strip of paper that is curved to fit the cone's surface. This strip should have a width that matches the height of the truncated cone and a length that matches the circumference of the cone's middle circle (the widest part).

- Option (A) is a straight rectangular strip, which cannot fit the curved surface of the cone.
- Option (B) is a trapezoidal shape, which does not match the curved surface of the cone.
- Option (C) is a semi-circular shape, which does not cover the entire height of the cone.
- Option (D) is a shape that partially covers the cone but does not match the curvature.
- Option (E) is a curved strip that matches the curvature of the cone and covers the entire height, making it the correct choice.

Answer: E
