### Reasoning:
1. Erich's phone number is seven digits long.
2. You have noted down six digits, which means one digit is missing.
3. To ensure you have the correct phone number, you need to determine which digit is missing and its position.
4. The maximum number of tries required to identify the missing digit and its position can be calculated by considering the worst-case scenario.
5. In the worst-case scenario, you would try each digit in each possible position until you find the correct one.
6. There are 10 possible digits (0-9) and 7 possible positions for the missing digit.
7. Therefore, the maximum number of tries would be 10 (digits) multiplied by 7 (positions), which equals 70 tries.
