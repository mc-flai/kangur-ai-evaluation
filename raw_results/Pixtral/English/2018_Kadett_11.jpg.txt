Reasoning: The problem states that Martina multiplies two two-digit numbers and then paints over some of the digits. We need to determine the sum of the three digits that Martina has painted over. The equation shown is \(3 \times 2 = 3 \overline{2}\).

First, let's analyze the multiplication \(3 \times 2\). The correct result of this multiplication is \(6\), not \(3 \overline{2}\). This suggests that the digits shown in the result \(3 \overline{2}\) are altered or painted over in some way.

Given the options:
- (A) 5
- (B) 6
- (C) 9
- (D) 12
- (E) 14

We need to find the sum of the digits that are painted over. The digits shown are \(3\) and \(2\). The sum of these digits is \(3 + 2 = 5\).

Answer: A
