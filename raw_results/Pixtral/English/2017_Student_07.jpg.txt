### Reasoning:
The problem involves determining which 4 × 1 × 1 cuboid can be built entirely out of 4 × 1 × 1 cuboids composed of 2 white and 2 grey cubes. Each 4 × 1 × 1 cuboid must have an equal number of white and grey cubes in specific positions to match the given configuration.

- Option (A): This cuboid has a pattern that alternates between white and grey cubes. It can be constructed using the given 4 × 1 × 1 cuboids.
- Option (B): This cuboid has a pattern where the cubes are not evenly distributed between white and grey. It cannot be constructed using the given 4 × 1 × 1 cuboids.
- Option (C): This cuboid has a pattern where the cubes are not evenly distributed between white and grey. It cannot be constructed using the given 4 × 1 × 1 cuboids.
- Option (D): This cuboid has a pattern where the cubes are not evenly distributed between white and grey. It cannot be constructed using the given 4 × 1 × 1 cuboids.
- Option (E): This cuboid has a pattern that alternates between white and grey cubes. It can be constructed using the given 4 × 1 × 1 cuboids.

### Answer:
A), E)
