### Reasoning:

The statement "Die Aussagen (A) – (E) werden der Reihe nach auf ihre Wahrheit überprüft. Welche davon ist die erste wahre Aussage?" translates to "The statements (A) – (E) are checked in order for their truth. Which one of them is the first true statement?"

To determine which statement is the first true one, we need to evaluate each statement (A) through (E) in the order they are presented and identify the first one that is true.

### Answer:

A) (C) is true.
