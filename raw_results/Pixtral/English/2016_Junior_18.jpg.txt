### Reasoning:
1. **Identify the total sum of all the numbers on the cards**:
   The numbers on the cards are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128. The sum of these numbers is:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255
   \]

2. **Determine the difference between the sums of the envelopes chosen by Eva and Ali**:
   According to the problem, Eva's sum is 31 greater than Ali's sum. Let \( E \) be the sum of the numbers chosen by Eva and \( A \) be the sum of the numbers chosen by Ali. We have:
   \[
   E = A + 31
   \]

3. **Express the total sum in terms of \( E \) and \( A \)**:
   Since the total sum of all numbers is 255, we can write:
   \[
   E + A = 255
   \]

4. **Substitute the relationship between \( E \) and \( A \) into the total sum equation**:
   Substituting \( E = A + 31 \) into \( E + A = 255 \), we get:
   \[
   (A + 31) + A = 255
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   2A + 31 = 255
   \]

5. **Solve for \( A \)**:
   \[
   2A = 255 - 31
   \]
   \[
   2A = 224
   \]
   \[
   A = 112
   \]

6. **Determine the number of envelopes chosen by Eva**:
   Since \( E = A + 31 \), we have:
   \[
   E = 112 + 31 = 143
   \]

7. **Calculate the number of envelopes chosen by Eva**:
   The total number of envelopes is 8. If Ali takes the remaining envelopes, the number of envelopes chosen by Eva is:
   \[
   8 - \text{number of envelopes chosen by Ali}
   \]
   Since \( A = 112 \), the number of envelopes chosen by Ali is 4 (because 112 is not a sum of the given numbers). Therefore, Eva must have chosen:
   \[
   8 - 4 = 4
   \]
