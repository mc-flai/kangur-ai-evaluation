Reasoning: To determine which square swaps the white and black areas to be the same size, we need to analyze the given options. Each option shows a different distribution of black and white areas. We need to find the option where the black and white areas are equal when the question mark is swapped with the given square.

- Option (A): The square is entirely white.
- Option (B): The square is entirely black.
- Option (C): The square has a small black area at the bottom.
- Option (D): The square has a black triangle at the bottom.
- Option (E): The square has a black area covering half of it.

By examining the options, we see that option (D) has a black triangle at the bottom. If we swap the question mark with this square, the black and white areas will be equal.

Answer: D)
