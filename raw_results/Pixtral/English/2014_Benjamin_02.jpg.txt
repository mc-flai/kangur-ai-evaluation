Reasoning:
1. Let's denote the weight of the biggest piece as x.
2. According to the problem, the weight of the biggest piece is equal to the combined weight of the other three pieces. Therefore, the total weight of the cake can be expressed as 2x (since x + x + x + x = 4x).
3. We know the total weight of the cake is 900 g. So, we can set up the equation: 4x = 900 g.
4. Solving for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 900 g / 4 = 225 g.
5. Therefore, the biggest piece weighs 225 g.
