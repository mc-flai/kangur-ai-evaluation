Reasoning:
1. First, we need to simplify the expression \((2^{22})^5 \times (5^{55})^{27}\).
2. Using the power of a power rule \((a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}\), we get:
   \[
   (2^{22})^5 = 2^{110}
   \]
   and
   \[
   (5^{55})^{27} = 5^{1435}
   \]
3. Now, we multiply the two results:
   \[
   2^{110} \times 5^{1435}
   \]
4. This product is a single number with a 1 followed by 110 + 1435 digits, which equals 1545 digits.
