### Reasoning:

1. We know that the sum of nine numbers in a 3x3 table is 500.
2. The numbers in two adjacent cells (with a common sideline) differ by exactly 1.
3. To find the number in the middle cell, we need to consider the pattern of differences.

Let's denote the numbers in the cells as follows, where the middle cell is the one we need to find:

```
a b c
d e f
g h i
```

Given that the sum of all nine numbers is 500, we can write:

\[ a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i = 500 \]

4. Since the numbers in adjacent cells differ by exactly 1, we can infer that the numbers form an arithmetic sequence along each row and column.

5. Let's assume the middle cell (e) is x. The numbers around it will be x-1, x+1, x-1, x+1, x-1, x+1, x-1, x+1.

6. The sum of the numbers in the middle row and column will be:

\[ (x-1) + x + (x+1) + (x-1) + x + (x+1) = 4x + 2 \]

7. The sum of the numbers in the middle column and row will be:

\[ (x-1) + x + (x+1) + (x-1) + x + (x+1) = 4x + 2 \]

8. The sum of all nine numbers is 500, so:

\[ 4x + 2 + 4x + 2 = 500 \]

\[ 8x + 4 = 500 \]

\[ 8x = 496 \]

\[ x = 62 \]

9. Therefore, the number in the middle cell is 62.
