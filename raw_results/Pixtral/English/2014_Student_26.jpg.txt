To determine the value of \( n \) for which the distance between \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) is exactly 1, we need to consider the geometric properties of the polygons involved.

1. **Understanding the Polygons**:
   - The 15-sided polygon \( ABC_1D_1E_1 \ldots \) and the \( n \)-sided polygon \( ABC_2D_2E_2 \ldots \) share a common edge \( AB \).
   - Both polygons have a side length of 1.

2. **Distance Between Vertices**:
   - The distance between \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) must be exactly 1.
   - Since the polygons are regular and lie on opposite sides of the common edge \( AB \), the distance between \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) will be influenced by the arrangement and symmetry of the polygons.

3. **Symmetry and Distance**:
   - For the distance between \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) to be exactly 1, the polygons must be arranged such that \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) are directly opposite each other along the line perpendicular to \( AB \).
   - This configuration requires that the polygons are symmetric with respect to the line through \( AB \).

4. **Determining \( n \)**:
   - The symmetry and the requirement for the distance to be exactly 1 suggest that the polygons must have a specific number of sides to achieve this configuration.
   - Given the options, we need to find the value of \( n \) that satisfies this condition.

5. **Checking the Options**:
   - Option (A) 10: This does not satisfy the symmetry requirement.
   - Option (B) 12: This does not satisfy the symmetry requirement.
   - Option (C) 15: This does not satisfy the symmetry requirement.
   - Option (D) 16: This does not satisfy the symmetry requirement.
   - Option (E) 18: This satisfies the symmetry requirement and the distance condition.

Therefore, the correct value of \( n \) is 18.

Reasoning: The polygons must be symmetric and directly opposite each other along the line perpendicular to \( AB \) for the distance between \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) to be exactly 1. This configuration is achieved with an \( n \)-sided polygon where \( n = 18 \).
