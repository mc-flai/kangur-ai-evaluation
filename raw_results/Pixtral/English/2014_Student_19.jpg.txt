### Reasoning:
1. We need to find 10 different positive whole numbers where exactly 5 are divisible by 5 and exactly 7 are divisible by 7.
2. The numbers divisible by 5 are of the form 5k, where k is an integer.
3. The numbers divisible by 7 are of the form 7m, where m is an integer.
4. We need to find a set of 10 numbers that includes exactly 5 multiples of 5 and exactly 7 multiples of 7.
5. The smallest set of such numbers can be formed by taking the first few multiples of 5 and 7:
   - Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25
   - Multiples of 7: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49
6. Combining these, we get the set: 5, 7, 10, 14, 15, 20, 21, 25, 28, 35.
7. The largest number in this set is 35.
