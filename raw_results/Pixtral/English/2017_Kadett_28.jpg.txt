### Reasoning:

1. **Determine the total distance of the track:**
   The track is 720 meters long.

2. **Calculate the speed of each runner:**
   - The first runner takes 4 minutes for one lap.
   - The second runner takes 5 minutes for one lap.
   - Speed is distance divided by time.
   - Speed of the first runner: \( \frac{720 \text{ meters}}{4 \text{ minutes}} = 180 \text{ meters per minute} \).
   - Speed of the second runner: \( \frac{720 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 144 \text{ meters per minute} \).

3. **Determine the relative speed when they run in opposite directions:**
   - Relative speed = Speed of the first runner + Speed of the second runner.
   - Relative speed: \( 180 \text{ meters per minute} + 144 \text{ meters per minute} = 324 \text{ meters per minute} \).

4. **Calculate the distance covered between two consecutive meetings:**
   - They meet every \( \frac{720 \text{ meters}}{324 \text{ meters per minute}} = 2.222 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Since the first runner takes 4 minutes for one lap, and the second runner takes 5 minutes, they meet twice in one lap.
   - Distance covered by the second runner between two consecutive meetings: \( 144 \text{ meters per minute} \times 2.222 \text{ minutes} \approx 320 \text{ meters} \).
