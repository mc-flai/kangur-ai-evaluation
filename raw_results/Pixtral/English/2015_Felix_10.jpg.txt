Reasoning: Each building block is made up of two cubes glued together. To determine which figure Michael cannot make, we need to analyze the configuration of each figure using these blocks. Figures A, B, C, and D each use the blocks in a way that allows for the formation of their shapes. However, figure E requires three separate blocks to achieve its height and structure. Since Michael only has two building blocks, he cannot create figure E.

Answer: E)
