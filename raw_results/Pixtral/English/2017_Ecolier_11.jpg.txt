Reasoning:
1. Marius buys exactly 70 balloons.
2. Balloons are sold in packages of 5, 10, or 25 pieces each.
3. To find the minimum number of packages, we should aim to use the largest package sizes possible to minimize the total number of packages.
4. Start by using the largest package size, which is 25 balloons per package.
5. Divide 70 by 25 to see how many full packages of 25 balloons can be bought:
   70 รท 25 = 2 with a remainder of 20.
6. This means 2 full packages of 25 balloons each account for 50 balloons.
7. Now, we need 20 more balloons. The next largest package size is 10 balloons per package.
8. Divide 20 by 10 to see how many full packages of 10 balloons can be bought:
   20 รท 10 = 2.
9. This means 2 full packages of 10 balloons each account for the remaining 20 balloons.
10. Therefore, the total number of packages Marius needs to buy is 2 (from the 25-balloon packages) + 2 (from the 10-balloon packages) = 4 packages.
