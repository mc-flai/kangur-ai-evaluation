### Reasoning:
To determine which point does not belong to the vertices of a square, we need to check the coordinates of each point and see if they can form a square. A square in a Cartesian coordinate system has vertices that are all at the same distance from each other and form right angles.

Let's check the coordinates:
- P(-1, 3)
- Q(0, -4)
- R(-2, -1)
- S(1, 1)
- T(3, -2)

We need to check if any three points can form a right angle and if the distances between the points are equal.

1. Calculate the distances between each pair of points:
   - Distance PQ: \(\sqrt{(-1-0)^2 + (3-(-4))^2} = \sqrt{1 + 25} = \sqrt{26}\)
   - Distance PR: \(\sqrt{(-1-(-2))^2 + (3-(-1))^2} = \sqrt{1 + 16} = \sqrt{17}\)
   - Distance PS: \(\sqrt{(-1-1)^2 + (3-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 4} = \sqrt{8}\)
   - Distance PT: \(\sqrt{(-1-3)^2 + (3-(-2))^2} = \sqrt{16 + 25} = \sqrt{41}\)
   - Distance QS: \(\sqrt{(0-1)^2 + (-4-1)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 25} = \sqrt{26}\)
   - Distance QT: \(\sqrt{(0-3)^2 + (-4-(-2))^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4} = \sqrt{13}\)
   - Distance RS: \(\sqrt{(-2-1)^2 + (-1-1)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4} = \sqrt{13}\)
   - Distance RT: \(\sqrt{(-2-3)^2 + (-1-(-2))^2} = \sqrt{25 + 1} = \sqrt{26}\)
   - Distance ST: \(\sqrt{(1-3)^2 + (1-(-2))^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9} = \sqrt{13}\)

2. Check if any three points form a right angle:
   - Using the distance formula, we need to check if any three points satisfy the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2).

After calculating, we find that the distances do not satisfy the conditions for a square. However, we need to identify which point does not fit the pattern.

3. Check the coordinates for forming a square:
   - For a square, the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the vertices should form pairs that are equidistant.

Upon checking, we find that the point T(3, -2) does not fit the pattern of the other points to form a square.
