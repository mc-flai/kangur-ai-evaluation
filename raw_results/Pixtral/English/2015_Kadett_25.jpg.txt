### Reasoning:
Florian needs to create a wire model of a cube with a side length of 1 cm. A cube has 12 edges. To determine the smallest number of wire pieces he can use, we need to find the combination of the given wire pieces that sums up to 12 cm without any overlapping.

The lengths of the wire pieces are: 1 cm, 2 cm, 3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm, 6 cm, and 7 cm.

Let's consider the possible combinations:
1. Using 12 pieces of 1 cm each: 12 pieces of 1 cm.
2. Using 6 pieces of 2 cm each: 6 pieces of 2 cm.
3. Using 4 pieces of 3 cm each: 4 pieces of 3 cm.
4. Using 3 pieces of 4 cm each: 3 pieces of 4 cm.
5. Using 2 pieces of 6 cm each: 2 pieces of 6 cm.

We need to find the combination that uses the fewest pieces. The combination of 2 pieces of 6 cm each totals 12 cm and uses only 2 pieces, which is the smallest number of pieces required.
