**Reasoning**:
1. The frog starts at one of the corners of a 4x4 grid of lily pads.
2. The frog can only jump to adjacent lily pads either horizontally or vertically.
3. The frog cannot land on the same lily pad twice.
4. To determine the maximum number of lily pads the frog can land on, we need to consider the total number of lily pads and the constraints of the frog's movement.

Since the grid is 4x4, it contains a total of 16 lily pads. The frog starts on one of these lily pads, so it can potentially land on a maximum of 16 - 1 = 15 lily pads.

However, the frog cannot jump back to the starting lily pad, and it must jump over at least one lily pad each time. This means the frog can only cover a maximum of 16 - 2 = 14 lily pads (excluding the starting lily pad and the lily pad it jumps back to).

**Answer**: B) 14
