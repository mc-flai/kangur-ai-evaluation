Reasoning: The dog turns 3 times to the right and 2 times to the left. We need to determine which path corresponds to these movements. Starting from the initial position, a right turn moves the dog to the next cell to the right, and a left turn moves the dog to the next cell to the left. By following this logic, we can trace the path for each option and see which one matches the described movements.

- Option A: The path starts with a right turn, followed by another right turn, then a left turn, another right turn, and finally a left turn. This matches the described movements (3 right turns and 2 left turns).
- Option B: The path does not match the described movements.
- Option C: The path does not match the described movements.
- Option D: The path does not match the described movements.
- Option E: The path does not match the described movements.

Answer: A
