Reasoning: The question asks us to identify what one of the pieces looks like when the shape in the picture is split into three identical pieces. To solve this, we need to visualize how the entire shape could be divided into three equal parts. By examining the options, we can determine which one represents a single piece of the whole shape when divided into three identical parts.

- Option (A) shows a 2x2 square, which could be part of a larger 4x2 rectangle.
- Option (B) shows a 2x2 square, which could be part of a larger 4x2 rectangle.
- Option (C) shows a 1x4 rectangle, which could be part of a larger 4x2 rectangle.
- Option (D) shows a 2x2 square, which could be part of a larger 4x2 rectangle.
- Option (E) shows a T-shape, which could be part of a larger 4x2 rectangle.

Given that the shape in the picture is likely a 4x2 rectangle, the correct piece would be one that fits into this larger shape when divided into three identical pieces.

Answer: D
