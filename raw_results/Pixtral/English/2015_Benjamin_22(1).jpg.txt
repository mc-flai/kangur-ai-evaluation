Reasoning:
1. The problem states that Mike is sitting in the 18th compartment behind the engine, which is in the 3rd carriage.
2. The problem also states that Joanna is sitting in the 50th compartment behind the engine, which is in the 7th carriage.
3. Since each carriage has the same number of compartments, we need to determine the number of compartments in one carriage.

To find the number of compartments in one carriage, we can use the positions of Mike and Joanna:
- Mike is in the 18th compartment in the 3rd carriage.
- Joanna is in the 50th compartment in the 7th carriage.

The difference in compartment positions between Mike and Joanna is 50 - 18 = 32 compartments.
The difference in carriage positions between Mike and Joanna is 7 - 3 = 4 carriages.

Therefore, the number of compartments per carriage is 32 compartments / 4 carriages = 8 compartments per carriage.

Answer: B
