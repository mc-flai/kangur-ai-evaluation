Reasoning: To determine the maximum number of baskets Maria can fill with an equal amount of apples, peaches, and cherries, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the quantities of the fruits. The GCD will tell us the largest number of identical baskets that can be filled with the same number of each type of fruit.

- Quantity of apples: 42
- Quantity of peaches: 60
- Quantity of cherries: 90

We need to find the GCD of 42, 60, and 90.

First, let's find the prime factors of each number:
- 42 = 2 × 3 × 7
- 60 = 2^2 × 3 × 5
- 90 = 2 × 3^2 × 5

The common prime factors are 2 and 3. The smallest powers of these common factors are:
- 2^1
- 3^1

So, the GCD is 2 × 3 = 6.

This means Maria can divide the fruits into 6 baskets with an equal number of apples, peaches, and cherries in each basket.
