### Reasoning:
1. A bush has 10 twigs.
2. Each twig has either exactly 5 leaves or exactly 2 leaves.
3. We need to determine the total number of leaves on the bush.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of twigs with 5 leaves.
- \( y \) as the number of twigs with 2 leaves.

We know that:
\[ x + y = 10 \]

The total number of leaves \( L \) can be expressed as:
\[ L = 5x + 2y \]

We need to check which of the given options (45, 39, 37, 31) can be the total number of leaves.

### Calculations:
1. If \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 10 \):
   \[ L = 5(0) + 2(10) = 20 \]
   This is not one of the options.

2. If \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 9 \):
   \[ L = 5(1) + 2(9) = 5 + 18 = 23 \]
   This is not one of the options.

3. If \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 8 \):
   \[ L = 5(2) + 2(8) = 10 + 16 = 26 \]
   This is not one of the options.

4. If \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 7 \):
   \[ L = 5(3) + 2(7) = 15 + 14 = 29 \]
   This is not one of the options.

5. If \( x = 4 \) and \( y = 6 \):
   \[ L = 5(4) + 2(6) = 20 + 12 = 32 \]
   This is not one of the options.

6. If \( x = 5 \) and \( y = 5 \):
   \[ L = 5(5) + 2(5) = 25 + 10 = 35 \]
   This is not one of the options.

7. If \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 4 \):
   \[ L = 5(6) + 2(4) = 30 + 8 = 38 \]
   This is not one of the options.

8. If \( x = 7 \) and \( y = 3 \):
   \[ L = 5(7) + 2(3) = 35 + 6 = 41 \]
   This is not one of the options.

9. If \( x = 8 \) and \( y = 2 \):
   \[ L = 5(8) + 2(2) = 40 + 4 = 44 \]
   This is not one of the options.

10. If \( x = 9 \) and \( y = 1 \):
    \[ L = 5(9) + 2(1) = 45 + 2 = 47 \]
    This is not one of the options.

11. If \( x = 10 \) and \( y = 0 \):
    \[ L = 5(10) + 2(0) = 50 \]
    This is not one of the options.

Since none of the calculated values match the given options, the correct answer must be:

### Answer: E) None of the numbers from (A) to (D)
