### Reasoning:

1. **Determine the total number of guests that can be seated at tables with 3 or 4 chairs:**
   - Tables with 3 chairs can seat 3 guests each.
   - Tables with 4 chairs can seat 4 guests each.
   - A total of 36 guests can be seated at these tables.

2. **Calculate the maximum number of guests that can be seated at tables with 6 chairs:**
   - Tables with 6 chairs can seat 6 guests each.
   - Since there are 16 tables in total, the maximum number of guests that can be seated at tables with 6 chairs is \(16 \times 6 = 96\).

3. **Determine the number of guests that must be seated at tables with 3 or 4 chairs:**
   - The restaurant seats 72 guests in total.
   - Therefore, the number of guests seated at tables with 3 or 4 chairs is \(96 - 72 = 24\).

4. **Calculate the number of tables with 3 chairs:**
   - Each table with 3 chairs seats 3 guests.
   - Let \(x\) be the number of tables with 3 chairs.
   - The number of guests seated at these tables is \(3x\).
   - The number of guests seated at tables with 4 chairs is \(24 - 3x\).

5. **Set up the equation:**
   - \(3x + (24 - 3x) = 24\).
   - Simplifying, \(24 = 24\).

6. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - \(3x + 24 - 3x = 24\).
   - This equation is true for any value of \(x\), indicating that the number of tables with 3 chairs can be any number that satisfies the seating arrangement.

7. **Determine the correct number of tables with 3 chairs:**
   - Since the problem does not provide additional constraints, we need to consider the possible options.
   - Options A (4), B (5), C (6), D (7), and E (8) must be evaluated based on the seating capacity and the total number of guests.
