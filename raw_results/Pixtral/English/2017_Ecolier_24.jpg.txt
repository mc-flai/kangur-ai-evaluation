To determine the number of Smileys Leonie has hidden, we need to analyze the grid and the numbers indicating the count of Smileys in neighboring boxes.

First, let's break down the grid:
- The grid is 4 rows by 4 columns.
- The numbers in the grey boxes indicate the count of Smileys in neighboring boxes.

Reasoning:
1. The top-left grey box has the number 2. This means there are 2 Smileys in the neighboring boxes to its right and below.
2. The top-right grey box has the number 3. This means there are 3 Smileys in the neighboring boxes to its left, above, and below.
3. The middle-left grey box has the number 2. This means there are 2 Smileys in the neighboring boxes to its right and above.
4. The middle-right grey box has the number 2. This means there are 2 Smileys in the neighboring boxes to its left and below.
5. The bottom-left grey box has the number 1. This means there is 1 Smiley in the neighboring box to its right.
6. The bottom-right grey box has the number 2. This means there are 2 Smileys in the neighboring boxes to its left and above.

By counting the total number of Smileys indicated by the numbers in the grey boxes, we can determine the total number of Smileys hidden.
