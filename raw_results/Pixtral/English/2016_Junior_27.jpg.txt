### Reasoning:

Jakob writes down four consecutive positive whole numbers and calculates all possible sums of three of those numbers. None of these sums is a prime number. To find the smallest number Jakob could have written down, we need to consider the properties of prime numbers and consecutive numbers.

1. **Consecutive Numbers**: If Jakob writes down four consecutive numbers, let's denote them as \( n, n+1, n+2, n+3 \).

2. **Sums of Three Numbers**: The possible sums of three of these numbers are:
   - \( n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3 \)
   - \( n + (n+1) + (n+3) = 3n + 4 \)
   - \( n + (n+2) + (n+3) = 3n + 6 \)
   - \( (n+1) + (n+2) + (n+3) = 3n + 6 \)

3. **Prime Numbers**: None of these sums should be a prime number. Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

4. **Smallest Number**: To find the smallest number Jakob could have written down, we need to start with the smallest possible set of consecutive numbers and check if any of the sums are prime.

Let's start with the smallest set of consecutive numbers:

- If Jakob writes down \( 3, 4, 5, 6 \):
  - Sums: \( 3+4+5 = 12 \), \( 3+4+6 = 13 \), \( 3+5+6 = 14 \), \( 4+5+6 = 15 \)
  - All sums are composite numbers (not prime).

- If Jakob writes down \( 2, 3, 4, 5 \):
  - Sums: \( 2+3+4 = 9 \), \( 2+3+5 = 10 \), \( 2+4+5 = 11 \), \( 3+4+5 = 12 \)
  - The sum \( 2+3+5 = 10 \) is composite, but \( 2+4+5 = 11 \) is prime.

Therefore, the smallest number Jakob could have written down is \( 2 \), which is the first number in the set \( 2, 3, 4, 5 \).
