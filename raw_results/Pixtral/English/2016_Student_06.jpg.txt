Reasoning: To determine the minimum number of planes necessary to border a certain region in a three-dimensional space, we need to consider the dimensionality of the space and the nature of planes. In a three-dimensional space, a single plane can intersect with other planes to create bounded regions. The minimum number of planes required to completely enclose a region in three-dimensional space is three. This is because three non-parallel planes can intersect and form a three-dimensional volume, effectively bordering the region.

Answer: C)
