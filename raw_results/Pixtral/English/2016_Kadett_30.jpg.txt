**Reasoning:**
1. The problem describes a cube of side length 3, consisting of 15 black and 12 white unit cubes.
2. We need to identify the 6th face of the cube from the given options (A) to (E).
3. To solve this, we need to analyze the visible faces of the cube and deduce the hidden face.

First, let's analyze the visible faces:
- The first face (top-left) shows a 3x3 grid with 5 black and 4 white cubes.
- The second face (top-middle) shows a 3x3 grid with 4 black and 5 white cubes.
- The third face (top-right) shows a 3x3 grid with 6 black and 3 white cubes.
- The fourth face (bottom-left) shows a 3x3 grid with 4 black and 5 white cubes.
- The fifth face (bottom-middle) shows a 3x3 grid with 5 black and 4 white cubes.

Now, let's analyze the options:
- (A) shows a 3x3 grid with 4 black and 5 white cubes.
- (B) shows a 3x3 grid with 5 black and 4 white cubes.
- (C) shows a 3x3 grid with 4 black and 5 white cubes.
- (D) shows a 3x3 grid with 5 black and 4 white cubes.
- (E) shows a 3x3 grid with 4 black and 5 white cubes.

Comparing the visible faces and the options, we see that:
- The first face matches option (B).
- The second face matches option (A).
- The third face matches option (D).
- The fourth face matches option (C).
- The fifth face matches option (E).

Since we have five visible faces, the sixth face must be the one not shown among the options. By elimination:
- Option (B) matches the first visible face.
- Option (A) matches the second visible face.
- Option (D) matches the third visible face.
- Option (C) matches the fourth visible face.
- Option (E) matches the fifth visible face.

Therefore, the sixth face must be option (B).

**Answer: B**
