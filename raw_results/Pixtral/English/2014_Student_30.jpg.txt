To determine the maximum number of animals that can still be on the island, we need to consider the interactions and transformations between the different types of animals.

1. **Initial Count**:
   - Goats: 17
   - Wolves: 55
   - Lions: 6

2. **Transformation Rules**:
   - A wolf eating a goat turns into a lion.
   - A lion eating a goat turns into a wolf.
   - A lion eating a wolf turns into a goat.

3. **Final State**:
   - No more eating can occur, meaning no animals can eat others.
   - This implies that all animals must be in a state where they cannot eat each other.

4. **Possible Final States**:
   - All wolves and lions must be in a state where they cannot eat each other.
   - This means all wolves must be in a state where they cannot eat goats, and all lions must be in a state where they cannot eat wolves.

5. **Maximum Number of Animals**:
   - Since no more eating can occur, the maximum number of animals will be when all wolves are in a state where they cannot eat goats, and all lions are in a state where they cannot eat wolves.
   - This means the maximum number of animals will be the sum of the initial number of goats, wolves, and lions.

6. **Calculation**:
   - Total initial animals = 17 (goats) + 55 (wolves) + 6 (lions) = 78

Therefore, the maximum number of animals that can still be on the island is 78.

Reasoning: By understanding the transformation rules and the final state where no more eating can occur, we conclude that the maximum number of animals will be the sum of the initial number of each type of animal.

Answer: E) 35
