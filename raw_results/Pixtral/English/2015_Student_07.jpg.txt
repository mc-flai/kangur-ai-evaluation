### Reasoning:

To determine the correct listing of all possible values of \( n \) for a convex quadrilateral, we need to understand the properties of a convex quadrilateral and how its angles relate to the number of right angles.

1. **Definition of Convex Quadrilateral**: A quadrilateral is convex if all its internal angles are less than 180 degrees.
2. **Sum of Internal Angles**: The sum of the internal angles of any quadrilateral is 360 degrees.
3. **Right Angles in a Convex Quadrilateral**: For a convex quadrilateral to have right angles, the sum of the right angles must be considered. Each right angle is 90 degrees.
4. **Possible Values of \( n \)**: Since the quadrilateral is convex, the sum of the right angles must be less than or equal to 360 degrees. We can calculate the possible values of \( n \) by considering the combinations of right angles that sum to less than or equal to 360 degrees.

Let's calculate the possible values of \( n \):

- \( n = 0 \): No right angles.
- \( n = 1 \): One right angle (90 degrees).
- \( n = 2 \): Two right angles (180 degrees).
- \( n = 3 \): Three right angles (270 degrees).
- \( n = 4 \): Four right angles (360 degrees).

These values satisfy the condition that the sum of the right angles is less than or equal to 360 degrees.
