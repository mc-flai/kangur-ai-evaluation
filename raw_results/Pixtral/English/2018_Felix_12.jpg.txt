### Reasoning:
1. We need to form two-digit numbers using the digits 2, 0, 1, or 8.
2. The numbers must be greater than 10 and smaller than 25.
3. Each number must be made up of two different digits.

Let's list all possible two-digit combinations using the given digits:

- Using 2:
  - 20 (uses 2 and 0)
  - 21 (uses 2 and 1)
  - 28 (uses 2 and 8)

- Using 0:
  - 01 (uses 0 and 1)
  - 02 (uses 0 and 2)
  - 08 (uses 0 and 8)

- Using 1:
  - 10 (uses 1 and 0)
  - 12 (uses 1 and 2)
  - 18 (uses 1 and 8)

- Using 8:
  - 80 (uses 8 and 0)
  - 82 (uses 8 and 2)
  - 81 (uses 8 and 1)

Now, let's ensure each number is made up of two different digits:
- 20 (2 and 0)
- 21 (2 and 1)
- 28 (2 and 8)
- 01 (0 and 1)
- 02 (0 and 2)
- 08 (0 and 8)
- 10 (1 and 0)
- 12 (1 and 2)
- 18 (1 and 8)
- 80 (8 and 0)
- 82 (8 and 2)
- 81 (8 and 1)

Counting these, we get a total of 12 different numbers.
