To determine how many different three-digit numbers \(ABC\) exist such that \((A + B)^C\) is a three-digit power of two, we need to analyze the conditions under which this is possible.

1. **Understanding the condition**: For \((A + B)^C\) to be a three-digit power of two, \(C\) must be a positive integer, and \(A + B\) must be such that raising it to the power \(C\) results in a three-digit number.

2. **Identifying possible values of \(C\)**: Since \(C\) is a positive integer and \((A + B)^C\) is a three-digit number, \(C\) must be less than 10 because any power greater than 9 will result in a number with more than three digits.

3. **Identifying possible values of \(A + B\)**: \(A\) and \(B\) are digits, so \(A + B\) can range from 0 to 18. However, for \((A + B)^C\) to be a three-digit number, \(A + B\) must be such that \(2^c\) (where \(c\) is the logarithm base 2 of \((A + B)^C\)) is within the range of 100 to 999.

4. **Checking possible combinations**: We need to check each possible value of \(C\) from 1 to 9 and determine if there are any valid combinations of \(A\) and \(B\) that satisfy the condition.

   - For \(C = 1\): \((A + B)^1 = A + B\). This must be a three-digit number, which is impossible since \(A + B\) is at most 18.
   - For \(C = 2\): \((A + B)^2\) must be a three-digit number. Possible values of \(A + B\) are 4, 8 (since \(4^2 = 16\) and \(8^2 = 64\)).
   - For \(C = 3\): \((A + B)^3\) must be a three-digit number. Possible values of \(A + B\) are 2, 4 (since \(2^3 = 8\) and \(4^3 = 64\)).
   - For \(C = 4\): \((A + B)^4\) must be a three-digit number. Possible values of \(A + B\) are 2, 4 (since \(2^4 = 16\) and \(4^4 = 256\)).
   - For \(C = 5\): \((A + B)^5\) must be a three-digit number. Possible values of \(A + B\) are 2, 4 (since \(2^5 = 32\) and \(4^5 = 1024\), which is not a three-digit number).
   - For \(C = 6\): \((A + B)^6\) must be a three-digit number. Possible values of \(A + B\) are 2, 4 (since \(2^6 = 64\) and \(4^6 = 4096\), which is not a three-digit number).
   - For \(C = 7\): \((A + B)^7\) must be a three-digit number. Possible values of \(A + B\) are 2, 4 (since \(2^7 = 128\) and \(4^7 = 16384\), which is not a three-digit number).
   - For \(C = 8\): \((A + B)^8\) must be a three-digit number. Possible values of \(A + B\) are 2, 4 (since \(2^8 = 256\) and \(4^8 = 65536\), which is not a three-digit number).
   - For \(C = 9\): \((A + B)^9\) must be a three-digit number. Possible values of \(A + B\) are 2, 4 (since \(2^9 = 512\) and \(4^9 = 262144\), which is not a three-digit number).

5. **Counting valid combinations**: From the above analysis, the valid combinations of \(A + B\) and \(C\) are:
   - \(A + B = 4\), \(C = 2\)
   - \(A + B = 4\), \(C = 3\)
   - \(A + B = 4\), \(C = 4\)
   - \(A + B = 2\), \(C = 3\)
   - \(A + B = 2\), \(C = 4\)

   This gives us a total of 5 different combinations.

Reasoning: We analyzed the condition for \((A + B)^C\) to be a three-digit power of two and identified the valid combinations of \(A + B\) and \(C\).
