### Reasoning:
1. We start with a 3 x 3 x 3 die, which has 27 small dice in total.
2. Seven small dice are removed, leaving a symmetrical figure.
3. The remaining figure is cut along a plane through the center and perpendicular to one of the four space diagonals.
4. To determine the cross-section, we need to visualize the cut and how it affects the internal structure of the die.
5. The cross-section will be a hexagon, but the specific shape and internal pattern depend on the arrangement of the removed dice.
6. By examining the options, we look for the hexagon that best represents the symmetrical removal and the resulting cross-section.
