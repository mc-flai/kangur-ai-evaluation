**Reasoning**: To determine the number that Riki needs to write in the zone marked with a question mark, we need to consider the rule that the number in each zone is the sum of all numbers in its adjacent zones. Let's analyze the given numbers and the possible options:

1. The number in the zone marked with "2" is given.
2. We need to find the number in the zone marked with a question mark.

Let's assume the zones are labeled as follows for clarity:
- Zone with "2"
- Zone with a question mark
- Other zones (not labeled in the problem)

We need to check which number, when placed in the zone with a question mark, will make the sum of adjacent zones consistent with the given number "2".

- If the number in the zone with a question mark is 1:
  - The sum of adjacent zones would be 2 + 1 = 3, which does not match any of the given options.

- If the number in the zone with a question mark is -2:
  - The sum of adjacent zones would be 2 - 2 = 0, which matches option E.

- If the number in the zone with a question mark is 6:
  - The sum of adjacent zones would be 2 + 6 = 8, which does not match any of the given options.

- If the number in the zone with a question mark is -4:
  - The sum of adjacent zones would be 2 - 4 = -2, which matches option B.

- If the number in the zone with a question mark is 0:
  - The sum of adjacent zones would be 2 + 0 = 2, which does not match any of the given options.

Therefore, the correct number that Riki needs to write in the zone marked with a question mark is -4.

**Answer**: D
