### Reasoning:
To determine the number of different ways the mouse can escape the labyrinth, we need to consider the paths available at each junction. Each time the mouse encounters a junction, it has multiple choices of paths to take. The mouse must go through each opening only once.

Let's break down the possible paths:

1. The mouse starts at the initial point.
2. At the first junction, the mouse has 3 choices.
3. At the second junction, the mouse has 2 choices.
4. At the third junction, the mouse has 3 choices.
5. At the fourth junction, the mouse has 2 choices.
6. At the fifth junction, the mouse has 3 choices.
7. At the sixth junction, the mouse has 2 choices.
8. At the seventh junction, the mouse has 3 choices.
9. At the eighth junction, the mouse has 2 choices.

To find the total number of different ways the mouse can escape, we multiply the number of choices at each junction:

Total paths = 3 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 3 × 2

Calculating this gives:

Total paths = 3 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 3 × 2 = 432
