Reasoning:
1. Kate starts with four flowers having 6, 7, 8, and 11 petals respectively.
2. She tears off one petal from each of three different flowers and repeats this process until it is no longer possible.
3. We need to determine the minimum number of petals left over after this process.

First iteration:
- Remove one petal from the flowers with 6, 7, and 8 petals.
- New counts: 5, 6, 7, and 11 petals.

Second iteration:
- Remove one petal from the flowers with 5, 6, and 7 petals.
- New counts: 4, 5, 6, and 11 petals.

Third iteration:
- Remove one petal from the flowers with 4, 5, and 6 petals.
- New counts: 3, 4, 5, and 11 petals.

Fourth iteration:
- Remove one petal from the flowers with 3, 4, and 5 petals.
- New counts: 2, 3, 4, and 11 petals.

Fifth iteration:
- Remove one petal from the flowers with 2, 3, and 4 petals.
- New counts: 1, 2, 3, and 11 petals.

Sixth iteration:
- Remove one petal from the flowers with 1, 2, and 3 petals.
- New counts: 0, 1, 2, and 11 petals.

At this point, it is no longer possible to tear off one petal from each of three different flowers because one flower has no petals left.
